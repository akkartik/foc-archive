In the most recent episode of the podcast, Katherine Ye mentioned in passing a game called DragonBox. I was a big fan of DragonBox back in the day, and I was excited to be reminded of it. The above video does a great job of quickly explaining how it works. Here's the App Store link if you want to try it yourself: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dragonbox-algebra-12/id634444186">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dragonbox-algebra-12/id634444186</a><br/><br/>Summary: through super-simple game mechanics, introduced one by one, you learn how to solve some fairly straightforward puzzles. Then, after solving a few dozen of these, the cute monster graphics start to be replaced with other symbols — first dice, then variables, then operators. Without all that much ceremony, you (spoiler) discover that you've been balancing, reducing, and solving algebraic equations all along.

I have no opinion on the pedagogical method. I just enjoy how nicely the game lets you <em>play</em> your way through some of symbolic algebra. Similar to how Nico Disseldorp's game Ancient Greek Geometry (<a href="http://sciencevsmagic.net/geo/">http://sciencevsmagic.net/geo/</a>) lets you play your way through its sacred namesake. I wonder if anyone has collected games that let you play your way through other parts of math. Personally, I'd love to play a game of group theory.

I got DragonBox to try out with my younger daughter but she wasn't interested. So I tried it with the elder, who has Williams Syndrome, and with some prompting, she was able to play it! I was gobsmacked (translate: pleasantly surprised)!<br/><br/>That's was many years ago, wonder how she'd do now, at 20..

I believe that getting a "feel" for abstract ideas in an almost physical way is how I experience maths and logic myself. Formulae or equations or expressions aren't abstract, they have their own laws of nature, just like picking up a screwdriver and easing in a screw to just the right torque, or getting solder flowing cleanly. There's a mental tension when things aren't done, relieved by a simplifying or cleaning up process. Maybe I'm not expressing that well: anyone else know what I'm getting at? :blush:

I feel DragonBox algebra accomplishes what it sets out to do very well: boil the frog of basic algebra manipulations via game mechanics.  I've been trying it with my four year old.  He's medium interested.  (Needs a few more days.)  Doesn't cohere as well as Monument valley.  The effects of actions are more arbitrary.  He found matching inverted color tiles as intuitive as matching -c with c.  It's a little too constrained, goal directed to be interesting.  Their DragonBox's Numbers game is better in that it has more a bit more freedom.  Currently Gorogoa is his favorite for its non-chronological narrative structure.  Those of you with little kids will be all too familiar with how their preferences and capabilities don't match up with adult categorizations.  For example, just yesterday I'm singing "Angels We Have Heard On High" to myself, he joins in with excellent harmony for about a minute then switches to fire-engine siren sounds 'cus it seems like the most naturally way this song should go to him.

I suppose my main frustration with DragonBox Algebra is that it's teaching algebra in much the same way I learned it: as a more or less arbitrary system of rules.  Fun as far as it goes, but there are better puzzle game mechanics to be had.  (Don't want to get into what makes for a good game just now.  Though I was guest lecturing about it last week.  I mean it's a topic I have more than a bit to say about.  Allotted two words, I'll go with "The Witness" and leave it at that.)

Should we be selling our children's souls so early?  In my education at least, Algebra's "arbitrary" manipulations are sort of a hoop jumping meta-game that culminates in Freshman Calculus (or AP Calc BC I think it was).

For me, personally, I had a long journey feeling early on that the grand book of philosophy stands open written in the language of mathematics.  Took a degree in mathematics (insufficient) with a followup in philosophy (better) to get oriented (Cartesian Closed Categories helped, see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conceptual-Mathematics-First-Introduction-Categories/dp/052171916X">https://www.amazon.com/Conceptual-Mathematics-First-Introduc&hellip;</a>).

Going back to Algebra, I would like to see games connect notions a bit better.  Montessori materials have an excellent design in this respect.  (A Montessori classroom is an excellent example of game design by the way.)  Most every activity has a mathematical element more or less developed.  To explore group theory <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span>, turtle graphics do have some nice affordances.  For something more game-like, Engare <a href="http://www.engare.design/">http://www.engare.design/</a> is a good choice.

Engare was great, but it didn’t have The Witness’s degree of “fully explore the mechanical space” Blow advocates for. I wonder if Meigakure will actually end up letting you <em>play</em> your way through 4D space. (4D Toys certainly didn’t.)

I suspect one key difference between all these examples is the way in which they guide you through the play space. (As you mentioned above — degrees of freedom.) DragonBox and Engare are very much “on rails”. 4D Toys is a total sandbox (and you have to tie one arm behind your back). I think there might be a happy medium.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> Yes, there is a compelling happy place between structure and freeform.  Too much structure, not much fun.  Too freeform, and you get listless not sure what to do.  What proves compelling really varies with the person and their mood.  For example, I went into playing the Witness with no background.  Hadn't even put together that Jonathan Blow was involved.  At first I was confused by the juxtaposition of puzzle panel screens in a lush impressionistic 3D world.  Seemed extraordinarily ill conceived.  (Soon enough I learned that my conception was at fault – and I learned a great many other things.)  As for "full exploration," the Witness is very much like the Goldberg variations, so thorough.  (In the text, Blow says as much by deeply hiding two paths of puzzles that end in literal dead-ends, "I thought of trying this and this, but these concepts didn't really go that far.")  Even Stephen's Sausage Roll, which starts extremely strong, loses coherence by the end.  Of course, it's much harder and more complicated than the Witness.  The Witness not only strips away frills but having chosen a relatively small space of possible games, Blow does a remarkable job of touring it.  Each of the few hundred puzzles says something, communicates, a language without words per se, a meditation on first Philosophy really starting from more basic basics.

For instance, the tutorial area, without talking at you, shows you all there is to the primary puzzle system (start at a circle, end at rounded nub, a puzzle can have multiple entrances, multiple exits, they light up wires to follow around the world).  You do this all to open a gate.  Later you can climb back around above the gate, to hear quote from Arthur Eddington.  It serves as a sort of epigraph explaining in words what you have experienced more directly:

"I am standing on the threshold about to enter a room. It is a complicated business. In the first place, I must shove against an atmosphere pressing with a force of fourteen pounds on every square inch of my body. I must make sure of landing on a plank traveling at twenty miles a second round the sun — a fraction of a second too early or too late, the plank would be miles away. I must do this whilst hanging from a round planet head outward into space, and with a wind of aether blowing at no one knows how many miles a second through every interstice of my body. The plank has no solidity of substance. To step on it is like stepping on a swarm of flies. Shall I not slip through? No, if I make the venture one of the flies hits me and gives a boost up again; I fall again and am knocked upwards by another fly; and so on. I may hope that the net result will be that I remain about steady, but if, unfortunately, I should slip through the floor or be boosted too violently up to the ceiling, the occurrence would be, not a violation of the laws of Nature, but a rare coincidence. These are some of the minor difficulties. I ought really to look at the problem four-dimensionally as concerning the intersection of my world-line with that of the plank. Then again, it is necessary to determine in which direction the entropy of the world is increasing in order to make sure that my passage over the threshold is an entrance, not an exit. Verily, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a scientific man to pass through a door. And whether the door be barn door or church door it might be wiser that he should consent to be an ordinary man and walk in rather than wait till all the difficulties involved in a really scientific ingress are resolved."

I felt like Engare was “on rails” as well, but I think that was a result of the systems it plopped you into having an artificially limited set of controls. Mahdi Bahrami, who made that game, is working on another game which is similarly-shaped but seems less on-rails: <a href="http://www.mahdibahrami.com/tandis">http://www.mahdibahrami.com/tandis</a>

I think that the general shape of “find one solution that produces this outcome” is a decent way to put learning into a game. Zachtronics games are another example of this – in those games, there are leaderboards for optimizing your solution, which I think is a neat addition.

I’m finding it difficult to think of a learning system which isn’t based around arbitrary rules. Learning how to navigate social situations seems like an extremely wholesome and valuable set of rules in that they enable you to connect with other people, but doesn’t seem intrinsically more or less valuable than another set of rules in terms of learning. (Is internalizing how Mario moves, jumps, slides more valuable than internalizing how to solve a puzzle from the Witness? After all, you could apply Mario’s physics to the physical world.)

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@David Lee</span> Yes, getting a really good game out of Bahrami's mechanics is a trick, would love to see.  Likewise, I'm waiting for a really good game with straight edge and compass constructions.  (Geometry is geometry for its own reasons, not because it makes a good game.  So there's a gap there.)  Mario physics certainly don't have much to do with the world, but they have a internal consistency and lovely feel.  Speaking of which, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> I always felt good platformers often have a nice groupish dynamic: waiting for platforms to synchronize.  When talking with those who don't "get Mario games," I like to share Mark Brown's analysis of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqHcE6B4OP4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqHcE6B4OP4</a>.

As for physics, I was playing through the Desert Ruin area again last night.  My first time I did not like it at all, "I see what you're doing, but oh how am I going to find the right place to stand.  This is totally random!"  Many have the same reaction.  It turns out though that all the puzzles there follow basic Newtonian optics.  And if you actually write out the lines and such – well, it's a bit of an Easter-egg.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> about groups.  You often have a few platforms moving at different rates where you have to wait until they line up.  The individual platforms are like cyclic groups.  The combined system is a direct product.  It's a great way to get an intuitive feel for the least common multiple.

Have I 100%ed the Witness?  Oh, dear friends, several times.  The Witness is my favorite game by far.  Watched a few others play through too, have a YouTube backlog.  These days, I'm working on 200%ing so to speak.  The Witness consists of a series of levels of abstraction, spheres if will – spheres with spheres, bubbles in a stream.  There are six worlds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysterium_Cosmographicum.">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysterium_Cosmographicum.</a>  The first two give you explicit rewards, that makes 100%.  After that, none: this isn't Fez.  The first is a tutorial for the second.  The second is a tutorial for the third.  Jonathan Blow has talked about the three levels and alluded to others.  They're on prominently display on the walls of the<br/>Monastery.  The third level is made from perspective Easter eggs.  In the fourth, the previous three levels combine into vignettes.  The fifth is a grand epic.  It includes the history of the world.  And the sixth is unattainable.

For an example vignette, visit the Chapel in the Quarry area.  You can find in installation of The March of Progress extended to a Gnostic conclusion under the watchful gaze of TJ Eckleburg.  I like to call the Witness the Ulysses of video games because they are similarly silly and obtuse and a literary gift that keeps on giving.

Sketches has the most interesting UI.  Pythagorea is the best game.  Euclidia has good puzzles, but they don't lead exactly lead you toward success.
