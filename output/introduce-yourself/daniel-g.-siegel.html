Hi! I’ve been hanging around here for a while and listening to the FoC Podcast, so I thought it’s time to finally introduce myself :slightly_smiling_face: I’m Daniel. I have a background in computer science and psychology, and over the years I’ve worked across Free & Open Source software (most notably with the GNOME project). I’ve been in the startup world, spent a few years in emerging tech consulting at Accenture, and these days I’m an independent consultant, speaker, and writer.<br/><br/>My work and philosophy are deeply rooted in the insights of visionaries like Doug Engelbart, Alan Kay, Neil Postman, James Burke, Joseph Weizenbaum, and Bret Victor. Their pioneering spirit, especially the idea that technology should not replace humans, but amplify human capabilities, is what guides my work.<br/><br/>Most recently, I founded the Big Idea Initiative - a playground for ideas that amplify our human capabilities and raise our collective intelligence.<br/><br/>We’re always looking for ideas, contributions, and people who want to explore new ways of thinking, building, and connecting. If you’ve got a half-baked thought, an experiment, or just curiosity - you’re very welcome to share and shape it with us.<br/><br/>You can find more here: <a href="https://www.bigideainitiative.org/">https://www.bigideainitiative.org/</a>
