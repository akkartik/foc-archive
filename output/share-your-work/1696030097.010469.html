Future of Coding • Episode 67<br/>Edsger Wybe Dijkstra • Go To Statement Considered Harmful<br/>𒂶 <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/067">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/067</a><br/><br/><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/362929.362947">Go To Statement Considered Harmful</a> is a solid classic entry in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful">X Considered Harmful</a> metafiction genre, authored by renowned computer scientist and idiosyncratic grump, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra">Edsger Wybe Dijkstra</a>. Surprisingly (given the impact it's had) this is a minuscule speck of a paper, lasting only 1-ish pages, and it even digresses several times from the main point. Fear not! Jimmy and I spend the entirety of these two podcast hours thoroughly analyzing the paper, wringing every last drop of insight from it, speaking directly to how programming ought to be reimagined from the molten venture capital core on up. Yes indeed, this is another episode in the fine tradition of Future of Coding where we stay faithfully close to the text, we leave the second-order implications alone, and there's nothing more than that. Nothing portended, nothing changed.

See Go To Statements and Good ALGOL Style (1963), Proof of Algorithms by General Snapshots (1966), and Programming by Action Clusters (1969).<br/><br/>And there is, of course, the most elegant way of avoiding goto's, by using COME FROM.<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180716171336/http://www.fortran.com/fortran/come_from.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20180716171336/http://www.fortra&hellip;</a><br/><br/><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM</a>

Every time someone re-listens to our INTERCAL episode because the nonsense is so good, they're implicitly following a COME FROM.<br/><br/>And every time someone bails on our Considered Harmful episode because the nonsense is just too much, they're implicitly following a GOTO.<br/><br/>There's just no denying the power of podcasts.

The editor who changed the name was Nicklaus Wirth, the inventor of Pascal, and one of the other great historical proponents of structured programming.<br/><br/>There were absolutely intermediate representations by 1968.  For example, see:<br/>The Design of the Gier ALGOL Compiler by Peter Naur (1963)<br/>ALGOL 60 Implementation by B. Randell and L. J. Russell (1964)<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure there are older examples, but I don't have access to my library right now so I am limited to my memory and the pale shadow of truth that can be found online.<br/><br/>Personally, I never really liked the whole concept of "where we are in the program" that he builds up in this paper. I think his discussion of how to reason clearly about the different structured statement types in Notes on Structured Programming<br/>(<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD249.PDF">https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD249.PDF</a>) is both easier to understand and far more useful from a practical perspective.<br/><br/>In Perl, goto will search the call stack for a matching label, like with exceptions. In Algol 60 and Pascal, since you are able to nest procedures within other procedures, you can use goto to jump to an error handler in a high level procedure regardless of how many intermediate procedure calls you are jumping out of.<br/><br/>Jimmy's argument against dependency injection, based on the fact that you don't know what code you are calling or what it will do, reminds me of the argument in Polymorphism considered harmful (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/181628.181635">https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/181628.181635</a>), and to some extent is also an argument against late binding, closures, function pointers, execution tokens, and ultimately object-oriented programming and functional programming as paradigms. [Later note: Ha ha! Jimmy claims OO considered harmful later in the episode! I disagree, but I respect your consistency! :joy: Oh wait, you like functional programming? :thinking_face:]<br/><br/><a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ClosuresAndObjectsAreEquivalent">https://wiki.c2.com/?ClosuresAndObjectsAreEquivalent</a><br/><br/>For the advantages of hiding implementation details within modules, and not making everything public, I believe Parnas provided an excellent argument.<br/><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/361598.361623">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/361598.361623</a><br/><br/>Your arguments against black boxes sound a lot like arguments against abstraction and even potentially code reuse in general. You might enjoy some of Charles Moore's early writings about Forth. One of his goals was to reduce the number of levels of abstraction and allow the programmer to work in a convenient environment while still having easy access to the lower level reality.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I think many modern programmers do not grasp the level of chaos that used to exist in many Fortran and Basic programs, and so they don't really understand the type of madness that Dijkstra was trying to reduce in the world. They assume that any goto is terrible and confusing, while sometimes a single goto in the right place can eliminate several flags and pieces of convoluted loop logic, making a piece of code much easier to understand.<br/><br/>There are empirical studies showing that for certain types of problems, more students can write correct solutions if they are allowed to use break statements, which are a type of goto that Dijkstra did not approve of.<br/><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/182.358436">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/182.358436</a><br/><a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/199691.199815">http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/199691.199815</a><br/><br/>I don't think Hopkins made as good of an argument as Knuth, but his paper still deserves a place in the cannon.<br/><a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/800194.805860">http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/800194.805860</a><br/><br/>Furthermore, in the Knuth paper that I linked above, he actually gives an example that Dijkstra admitted was a good use of a goto.<br/><br/>My favorite quote about goto comes from the original wiki at <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?GoTo">https://wiki.c2.com/?GoTo</a><br/>"The apprentice uses it without thinking. The journeyman avoids it without thinking. The master uses it thoughtfully."

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Christopher Shank</span> That's high praise — thank you! John Oswald (among other early electronic era Canadian experimental music heroes), Ergo Phizmiz, Avalanches, DJ Shadow, the early Danger Mouse mashups, Girl Talk, and countless others were on heavy rotation in the music scene where I spent my 20s. One of my closest friends pushed us all to take up Plunderphonics as one of our main genres, but I gravitated hard in the other direction. All the music I make is 99.9% actual recordings of me playing real instruments (with a virtual synthesizer once in a blue moon). Still, I appreciate the aesthetic viewpoint, and it sure beats the usual "hey this sounds like Radiohead" :)

I'll bite. Doesn't most programming in the small consist of a step-by-step process? Is there some more specific meaning I'm missing?

Sure.  When small enough that the process doesn't get interrupted and large (or awkward) enough that no single expression won't do.  Whether the semantics of the program are imperative or not, you'll want to name intermediate results.  It shouldn't be too hard to find an example of pure functional "step-by-step" programming...  Here <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.1.0/docs/src/GHC.IO.Exception.html#untangle">https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.1.0/docs/src/G&hellip;</a>:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">{-<br/>(untangle coded message) expects "coded" to be of the form<br/>        "location|details"<br/>It prints<br/>        location message details<br/>-}<br/>untangle :: Addr# -&gt; String -&gt; String<br/>untangle coded message<br/>  =  location<br/>  ++ ": "<br/>  ++ message<br/>  ++ details<br/>  ++ "\n"<br/>  where<br/>    coded_str = unpackCStringUtf8# coded<br/><br/>    (location, details)<br/>      = case (span not_bar coded_str) of { (loc, rest) -&gt;<br/>        case rest of<br/>          ('|':det) -&gt; (loc, ' ' : det)<br/>          _         -&gt; (loc, "")<br/>        }<br/>    not_bar c = c /= '|'</pre><br/>Consider that order of expressions in the <tt>where</tt> clause doesn't matter, but even then the awkward nested <tt>case</tt> expressions might benefit from even more intermediate steps:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">   (location, rest) = span not_bar coded_str<br/>   details | null rest = ""<br/>           | otherwise = ' ':(tail rest)</pre><br/>And maybe text is to blame for some awkwardness here.  Is jamming <tt>message</tt> between <tt>location</tt> and <tt>details</tt> intrinsically non-linear?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jimmy Miller</span> <br/>The original paper by Charles Moore, FORTH – A Language for Interactive Computing, begins with a long complaint about the hierarchy of languages and abstractions between the programmer and the computer. The paper itself is a historical document that does not describe the way modern, or even old school Forth systems were implemented, but it is a fun read.<br/><a href="https://www.1strecon.org/downloads/Forth_Resources/CM_ForthLanguageInteractiveComputing_1970.pdf">https://www.1strecon.org/downloads/Forth_Resources/CM_ForthL&hellip;</a><br/><br/>Starting Forth is an excellent introduction to old school Forth.<br/><a href="https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/">https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/</a><br/><br/>Thinking Forth is an amazing software engineering book filled with interviews and philosophy that would be a widely studied classic if it were not written through the lens of a less popular language. Within its pages one can find foreshadowing of Extreme Programming and Agile Programming.<br/><a href="https://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net/">https://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net/</a><br/><br/>Threaded Interpretive Languages: Their Design and Implementation by R. G. Loeliger is the classic guide to implementing Forth on a Z80.<br/><a href="https://archive.org/details/R.G.LoeligerThreadedInterpretiveLanguagesTheirDesignAndImplementationByteBooks1981">https://archive.org/details/R.G.LoeligerThreadedInterpretive&hellip;</a><br/><br/>Jonesforth is an x86 assembly language Forth implementation that is written as a tutorial with extensive comments. Or is it a Forth implementation tutorial that includes executable x86 assembly language code?<br/><a href="https://rwmj.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/jonesforth-git-repository/">https://rwmj.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/jonesforth-git-repository/</a><br/><br/>This Byte Magazine article has an excellent discussion of how threaded code works (no relation to multi-threaded parallelism or concurrency).<br/><a href="https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1980-09/page/n207/mode/1up">https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1980-09/page/n207/mode/1up</a><br/><br/>As you learn Forth, pay special attention to the concepts of immediate words, defining words, and compiling words. That is where you will find a level of magic roughly equivalent to that of Lisp macros, but implemented and used in a completely different manner.<br/><br/>And of course, no discussion of Forth would be complete without some mention of Forth on the Atari. It's not a particularly good read, but it has one of the most amazing covers of any programming book.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> I guess that depends on how much heavy lifting the word "most" is doing there, but I'd say that some domain-specific languages like <a href="https://github.com/TodePond/BerdLab/blob/main/index.html">CSS</a> and <a href="https://2023.splashcon.org/details/live-2023/6/CellPond-Spatial-programming-without-escape">CellPond</a> often don't involve step-by-step instructions (and try to actively avoid them).
