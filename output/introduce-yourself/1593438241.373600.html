Hi!<br/> <br/>I have already posted some "introduction" more than one year ago, but as today is a kind of "coming out" for me, I post a new one (or at least an update)! :slightly_smiling_face:<br/> <br/>In fact after very busy months on some cool-but-not-FoC-related project, today I start my 100% Future of Programming life. From now on, I will be fully committed in exploring, experimenting, state-of-the-arting, discussing and, of course, building stuff in this very exiting field. I have some ideas to experiment, old prototypes to reconsider (and throw away again after picking the good parts), users to meet, existing tools and languages to explore, etc.<br/> <br/>Here are some quick words on the vision of what I would like to work on. At a very high level, it is all about tools for thought, tools to create, tools to share ideas, tools to program. More concretely, I plan to work on collaborative programming environments usable by non experts. With a focus on how to provide the more expressive/tangible/interactive/malleable views of programming artifacts. As first "proglet" representations, I am thinking to explore two well-known and successful visual ones: blocks à la Scratch and nodes'n wires à la Max/MSP. But with the ability to still use text languages when the visual ones are not appropriate (yet). As they are widespread and covers most of the technical needs, all this will first be based on web standards, which will also ease adoption and meet some common first usages. Another "minor" reason, is that I actually enjoy programming in JavaScript (and even more in Vue.js)! Ok, ok, I can hear half of you saying "oh, nooo! not the web again" and the other half saying "obviously!", while a third half (hopefully, the bigger of the three halves) doesn't understand those petty squabbles. :smile:<br/> <br/>My background is nearly 30 years of professional programming on a wide range of fields (front/back/DB/infra/science/viz/GUI...), five years as an educator for creative computing with kids and adult beginners (mainly with Scratch) and a bit of programming for music/audio (with Live and MaxMSP) some times ago.<br/> <br/>Of course, I hope to be more active in this community (especially, compared to recently). I will be very happy to read and discuss all the very interesting subjects that you all are sharing here (some I have missed recently)!

That's fantastic. Also, good thinking to share it as a (re)introduction. Looking forward to seeing unfinished thoughts in #two-minute-week :)

I am on it, but, of course, it is complicated to select which "unfinished thought" to first show...

FWIW I thought it was a good idea to build prototypes on web tech (including Vue and Vue-like frameworks) but found that most of my time (100+ hours) was spent fighting/shoehorning into frameworks and HTML/CSS rather than getting actual work done. I've since decided to use a low-level vector graphics library and nothing else (no frameworks) as a foundation for the PL's own GUI. Anyone making programming languages for <em>building</em> GUI apps (like me) is going to have to start from this foundation anyway, otherwise HTML/CSS semantics are going to leak into the PL. I don't want users of my language having to think about web tech at all.

My choice of the web platform (and consequently of HTML/CSS), is more based on the fact that they are strong standards that exist everywhere, with good implementations. It is not based on their "technical merits".<br/>And if I don't use them in my projects, it means more work. On the contrary of you, I know that using something like Vue.js will make me build things a lot faster than any other GUI tool/framework I know (well, I must agree that every now and then there are some very lonely times trying to make CSS do what I want :face_with_rolling_eyes:).<br/>Plus I don't mind (for now) if HTML/CSS leak to the user, it can even be desirable because some users might feel comfortable with them. And maybe, later, there will be other ways to program GUI.

When building prototypes, I find the best language and platform for that is always what you feel most comfortable and fluent with. If you want to or not, great prototypes will be built several times over as you learn, even if you don’t actively restart development but gradually change things over time, so there will be plenty of opportunities to consider other languages and platforms later. Thinking too much about scaling or reach or popularity at the very early prototype stage is probably causing more harm than it helps. The only things that count in the beginning are that you know how to implement the next step of your vision, and that you enjoy doing it.
