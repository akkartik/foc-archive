Hello!<br/><br/>My name is Jeff, and a friend of mine clued me into this forum. A bit about me. I’m a semi-retired former principal engineer and my new life goal is to connect with why I got into this field in the first place: games.  My career was forged in distributed systems at Amazon S3 which prepared me to the architect of Facebook’s real-time infrastructure which manifested in a SOSP 21 paper: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477132.3483572">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477132.3483572</a><br/><br/>I've been working on a new programming language for a while called Adama, and I'm turning it into a data platform. This data platform will power a new collaborative IDE, and I’ll use this IDE to build board games. Board games are hard, and I love to play them. I’ve got my work cut out for me, but I’m having fun.<br/><br/>I have embarrassingly launched: <a href="https://www.adama-platform.com/2022/03/02/early-access-launch-and-confession.html">https://www.adama-platform.com/2022/03/02/early-access-launc&hellip;</a> with an open strategy: <a href="https://www.adama-platform.com/2022/02/24/open-strategy.html">https://www.adama-platform.com/2022/02/24/open-strategy.html</a> . I’m currently in the phase of “how do I even describe this thing” to cross various chasms. Fortunately, I’m betting on the end artifacts over the coming decades as I expect board games to still in exist in 10+ years.<br/><br/>I believe in mixing state and compute in a sane way, but this is exceptionally hard as you ultimately must build a database. At core, Adama enables people to DIY a real-time database. Fun enough, this work has connected me deeply to the Actor model as well as Alan Kay’s original meaning of object-orientated programming. A document with Adama is a siloed stateful object capable of receiving messages and emitting differential state updates to viewers.
