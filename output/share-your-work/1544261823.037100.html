I spent a while today thinking about how I've been debugging my low-level assembly programs, and writing up a little mini-howto: <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu/blob/master/subx/Readme.md#a-few-hints-for-debugging">https://github.com/akkartik/mu/blob/master/subx/Readme.md#a-&hellip;</a>. Comments and feedback appreciated.

I can't say I understand what you're trying to accomplish by revisiting assembly language - particularly assembly language for a specific processor. I myself would kill (like, a mouse or something) to get a job working on the design of WebAssembly, but then I'd be programming everything in a higher-level language, except if I had to write some WebAssembly code (in which case I'd be interested in higher-level representations of it). x86? Yeah, I used it a bit 20 years ago when I had no choice.<br/><br/>So what are your goals and motivation?

Thanks! The problem statement is at <a href="http://akkartik.name/about">http://akkartik.name/about</a>. In brief:<br/><br/>• I’m trying to increase the level of review open source software receives from outsider developers who aren’t invested in its history. Doing this will make our world more anti-fragile. But the ways I’ve come up with don’t work on existing software. They require writing software to be more easily reviewable. (And also rewrite-friendly. I think those two goals are deeply isomorphic.)<br/><br/>• I think the way programmers divide up work into (prematurely frozen) interfaces causes all software to tend to bitrot over time, even if the initial design is clean.<br/><br/>The only plan I’ve been able to come up with to falsify these hypotheses is to create a small clean-room stack without dependencies on existing software, and to hopefully get a small group of people collaborating and sharing code atop it.<br/><br/>There’s gaps in this explanation. Feel free to ask me more questions after reading the link above.
