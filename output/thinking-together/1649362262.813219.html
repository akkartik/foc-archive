Inspired by the recent post on Crosscut, I started thinking about geometric programming, and what it might look like.<br/>I came up with the idea of using areas and line segments of 2D shapes as inputs and outputs.<br/>For example, a rectangle gives us addition (the half circumference), multiplication (the area), square root (using area as an input and measuring one of the sides):<br/>(image 1)<br/>One could imagine an iteration construct ala the one in Bret Victors computational drawing program, or similar to the one in Crosscut, that allowed expressing e.g. Fibonacci iteratively:<br/>(image 2)<br/>Here the green arrows connect inputs lines to output lines, and the dots show where line segments begin and end.<br/>The dotted rectangles represent iteration, where the first rectangle is used to specify the relation to previous rectangles (exactly how is a bit vague, I know). The green line sets the distance between each iteration.<br/>Similarly, a unit circle could show the angle as a bent line (in radians, as the circumference is 2*pi), and sin/cos as shown. Using sin/cos as inputs and measuring the bent line you get asin and acos:<br/>(image 3)<br/>Thoughts? Maybe it already exists?

Hey, this is pretty cool!<br/><br/>Whenever thinking about geometrically constructing math formulae, I like to reference the section Constructing Reals from Rudy Rucker's wonderful book <em>Infinity and the Mind</em> — <a href="https://www.rudyrucker.com/infinityandthemind/#calibre_link-318">https://www.rudyrucker.com/infinityandthemind/#calibre_link-318</a>

It's important to ask whether the geometric representations you use actually contribute to understanding.<br/><br/>Take your Fibonacci example. I don't think representing addition as the half-perimeter of a rectangle provides me with any intuition or insight here. To me, this particular diagram would be better off if you just stacked the input segments to form the output segment.<br/><br/>Better still might be a Fibonacci spiral construction, as shown below. No clue (offhand) how to represent this construction in a programming system, but it says a lot more, geometrically, than half-perimeters of rectangles /or/ stacked segments.

Yeah, that's something we ran into with Crosscut and didn't really engage with. The freedom to draw "whatever" at the concrete level is really pleasing; being able to manipulate the "whatever" using a dynamic system is appealing. But having vector math be the <em>only</em> way to do that dynamic manipulation is such a narrow channel through which to work — it's very unlikely to match the character of the "whatever" you drew.<br/><br/>I'd like to lean away from geometric representation entirely. That means no vector math — probably no math at all. I want to see what <em>that</em> dynamic / programming system might look like.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> I don't know if I can even conceive of that kind of system. If its not vector math, and it's not geometric representations I don't know what you would have left.
