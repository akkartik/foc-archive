Hi all! I'm Federico. Originally from Argentina, based in the Netherlands. I've been programming for about 15 years now (yikes!). For almost as long I have dreamed of build a programming tool to replace spreadsheets. The reason for this is that very early on I found Paul Graham's essays and Steve Yegge's rants, and those two set me in a contrarian path of looking for a better way to program. I love programming, but I am very aware of how much crap one has to deal with in order to get something done. I firmly believe (and already start to see) that that no longer needs to be the case, and I'm happy to interact with a community that feels in the same way.<br/><br/>Except for some sparse 1:1 communication with a few people in the open source community, I've been thinking and writing mostly in isolation. I'm now ready to change that and this feels like a great place to open up and start interacting more. I discovered FoC through val.town's blog.<br/><br/>Really looking forward to read your ideas and get some feedback on my work!
