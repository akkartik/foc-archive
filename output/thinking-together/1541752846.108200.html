Thanks so much for posting the LIVE talks, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span>! I listened to the Chris Granger talk yesterday, and it was an incredibly valuable honest look at the development process and struggles.<br/><br/>It made me wonder if anyone’s put together a summary of different successful programming languages &amp; environments and where they came from—my gut feel is very few if any were the focus of a startup, but rather came about from academia, hobbyists, or from big orgs that could afford a long gestation (e.g. Swift, Go)

Ruby has it's own lore.  I have a few bits gathered from who knows where.  Like this quote:<br/><br/>For me the purpose of life is partly to have joy. Programmers often feel joy when they can concentrate on the creative side of programming, So Ruby is designed to make programmers happy. ...<br/><br/>You want to enjoy life, don't you? If you get your job done quickly and your job is fun, that's good isn't it? That's the purpose of life, partly. Your life is better.<br/><br/>I want to solve problems I meet in the daily life by using computers, so I need to write programs. By using Ruby, I want to concentrate the things I do, not the magical rules of the language, like starting with public void something something something to say, "print hello world." I just want to say, "print this!" I don't want all the surrounding magic keywords. I just want to concentrate on the task. That's the basic idea. So I have tried to make Ruby code concise and succinct.<br/><br/>Sometimes people jot down pseudo-code on paper. If that pseudo-code runs directly on their computers, it's best, isn't it? Ruby tries to be like that, like pseudo-code that runs.

Thanks! I enjoyed the bits in the Lua paper about the evolutionary pressures that shaped it: that its host organization had to support a variety of machines, which led to Lua being very portable, which helped its early external adoption

Lua is pretty much a minimal dynamic language with as few opinions as they could manage.  My favorite example is their solution any camelCase/snake_case debate: have all the builtins be a single word.  It's a silly example, but mostly permeates the language.
