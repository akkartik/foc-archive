I've been thinking some more and I worry that when I said, "what about a year?," that it's actually just not enough time.  Part of my reasoning with that, is that rethinking software construction is also probably deeply connected to rethinking hardware architecture.  It's a big task and I'm not sure how far you can get even in a year.  And stretching it to be multi-year makes it almost completely unviable for 99% of the types of researchers that would be a good match for it.
