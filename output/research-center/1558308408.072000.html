At first, I thought that impact of The Research Centre would come from creating software that solves real problems, and that people will actually use.<br/><br/>But that's not quite right. The impact of Xerox PARC wasn't specifically in the Smalltalk-80 software, it was in the theoretical concepts they developed, such as Object Oriented Programming, and the Graphical User Interface. These are such good ideas that they have been continually reimplemented and refined by many different software projects.<br/><br/>For example, Steve Krouse has this vision of comprehensible Functional Reactive Programming, which is modular and composable, and also easy to understand. A good solution to this research problem might lead to lots of independent implementations in many languages.<br/><br/>But even that concept of impact needs further tweaking. The impact of Doug Englebart's NLS system is usually remembered in terms of certain technologies that he pioneered, such as windows, the mouse, hypertext, etc. But those things are subsidiary to the goals that Englebart set for his project, which was the augmentation of human intellect, on both a personal and on a group level, in order to tackle the important and pressing challenges of the world, using a bootstrapping process to accelerate innovation while maximizing results. [Eg, see "Englebart's Unfinished Revolution", <a href="http://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/223/">http://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/223/</a>]<br/><br/>So I think the most important thing is to enumerate the goals of the next software revolution. And that will define what research problems need to be solved. And the solutions to those research problems will then be implemented by a lot of different software systems, leading to new software that solves real problems, that people will want to use.
