Just to continue the conversation about collaboration a bit… RPCs have been the secret sauce in all my successful collaborations, large and small.<br/><br/>At work, hundreds of people collaborate by splitting into 3–10 person teams whose servers communicate over agreed-upon protocols. Teams just exchange addresses then go to work in their silos where communication is lightweight. In my side-projects, RPCs allow everybody involved to use their favorite programming languages and development environments. And in academia, the people who built on my work did so <em>because</em> I released it as a library with a well-defined protocol.<br/><br/>On the flip side, the biggest failures I've been a part of started with "let's all work on the same code base" as a key part of their mission. When there were a lot of people, the failure was because that goes against any hierarchical organizational structure. When there were few people, having no clear areas of ownership led to a tragedy of the commons.<br/><br/>So if we want to change coding to make collaboration more efficient, I think we need languages that give us vastly more separation, to enable the divide-and-conquer strategy of collaboration that people tend to use. At authoring time, it's limiting that my team has to contribute to your project in Python because your part is in Python, and that you should even notice if mine isn't in Python. At run-time, it's limiting that when your piece crashes mine goes down with it. At source control time, it's painful that our changes are interspersed such that my piece is broken until you fix yours. And at design time, it's inefficient for every line of code to be up for debate rather than having the boundary between my part and your part be the sole surface of discussion.
