Hi! everyone! I’m Ville Ilkkala from a Finnish startup called Valaa Technologies. We are working on an open source software development architecture called ValOS (Valaa Open System) that is based on sort of an direct manipulation programming and a globally distributed event sourcing mechanism that covers also the application source code, not just the data.<br/><br/>I am more of an prototype user / citizen developer and I have written my first full-stack applications with the ValOS platform (I never really got my head around existing web development stacks and suffered the most with back ends and databases). Others in our team are working on the core technology and the web IDE. My prior working history includes educational game design, interaction and concept design and other things going on <em>around</em> the code. Since getting my feet wet with programming I have also started teaching it to non-programmers using our platform.<br/><br/>I learned about <a href="http://futureofcoding.org">futureofcoding.org</a> last year when Steve sent me an bug report that our IDE doesn’t even start. :smile: He interviewed us last week and posted the video on #share-your-work.<br/><br/>The projects here seem super interesting and inspiring. I look forward to discussions, feedback and meeting new people. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>I'm most active in LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ville-ilkkala-1809b319/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ville-ilkkala-1809b319/</a>
