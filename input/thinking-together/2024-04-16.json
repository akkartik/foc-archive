It seems like you want to see something like the Smalltalk system, where everything is an object, and you can use one tool to edit and object, such as a drawing or a document, and then reuse the same object in your programming. The Smalltalk system solved this by not having a compile-time, but instead doing all programming in a live system. When you want to deploy it on another machine, you save an image of the heap, and that's const data that you can run on another machine without doing any processing on startup.
