My thoughts on the Dynamicland system: The focus is on the objects and how they can interact and be understood, rather than the current implementation of code or the “papers and dots” Augmented Reality system.\n\nImportant points not related to the code or RealTalk implementation:\n• Always on. Key to making the system more casual.\n• 1-to-1 relation between seeing an object in the world and it having influence on the world. This is key to understandability.\n• Use affordances of physical objects, rather than trying to solve them in code. The tangibility is important here, but using physical objects can also reduce the scope of what code has to do. For example, your code becomes simpler if you don’t have to worry about fitting modals, tabs, and substates into a single screen if you can separate them across many papers\/programs. This also includes using the spatial relation of programs to influence control flow.",

The tangibility is important here, but using physical objects can also reduce the scope of what code has to do. For example, your code becomes simpler if you don’t have to worry about fitting modals, tabs, and substates into a single screen if you can separate them across many papers\/programs. This also includes using the spatial relation of programs to influence control flow."
