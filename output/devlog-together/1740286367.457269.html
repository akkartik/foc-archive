Have been trying to build out and share more demos of practical uses of agents these last few weeks using the ai framework I've been building, and all my past demos have involved calls to LLMs, but this latest one is just API calls between different services but using the agent patterns.<br/><br/>Was just struck by how different and much simpler the design for this came out using an agent framework than if i had built it a few years ago before diving in to building AI apps.<br/><br/>I'm starting to wonder if a pattern we'll start to see with all these agents people are building is to use an LLM in certain places at first (or just an old-school pre-llm implementation), but then over time replace that call over to something more deterministic or at least specialized once something stable comes out. Almost having to have well-factored designs up front because you're guaranteed to need to swap components out as better, cheaper, or faster ones come along.

hah, yeah for some of these demos it's been ai on the control plane, but for this one I'm not even using AI on the control plane, just building an event-based system with a tool-call-like paradigm - if there's no decision to make on which tool to call, you can skip the LLM altogether and just call the tool

I admit I may have just re-invented event-based programming with more steps :laughing: but even so...it's interesting to get here from the path of building agents...and at the very least finding out spending time in that paradigm has built out muscle memory for systems even when not using AI..
