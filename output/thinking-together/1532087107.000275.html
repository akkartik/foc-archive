hi! I'm Mariano Guerra, a Software Engineer from Argentina, currently living in Stuttgart, Germany. I work on a product (<a href="https://instadeq.com">https://instadeq.com</a>) that tries to bring the power of data processing to non programmers. After a couple of months of working on it I found out that there's a field called Programming by Demonstration that matches what instadeq does almost perfectly (it would have saved me some time to know about it before starting :slightly_smiling_face:)
