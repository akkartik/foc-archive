The point <@U6KQ2S410> was making was about what Bret never talks about - what he doesn't talk about is loss. If we are in the mission of democratising programming (or whatever we call it), ultimately we are in the game of transferring power from those who currently have it, towards those who are currently disempowered. What's missing from Bret's narrative is any downside for anyone - it's all rainbows and unicorns and inspiring stuff - which, we have to note, is why Bret is allowed to get away with having such a high profile for a \"revolutionary\" - because he is actually fundamentally unthreatening to those who currently hold the power (intellectual and corporate elites). Don't get me wrong - he is a smart and well-intentioned guy, and he has God's own reading list, and, if we are taking the mainstream of computer science as a starting point, he is clearly setting out in the right direction. It's just that he is not going to get us where we need to go, because ultimately no transfer of power is going to happen under his watch. We always have to bear in mind that when we are truly confronting power, things are going to get a bit ugly - power is never transferred without a struggle. In practice a lot of the systems we are going to end up building are going to look pretty undesirable to a lot of people who currently carry a lot of respect - if we are doing it right. The point isn't about skills or the lack of them, but about the trajectory of deploying those skills - what does the place we're trying to get to look like?",

If we are in the mission of democratising programming (or whatever we call it), ultimately we are in the game of transferring power from those who currently have it, towards those who are currently disempowered. What's missing from Bret's narrative is any downside for anyone - it's all rainbows and unicorns and inspiring stuff - which, we have to note, is why Bret is allowed to get away with having such a high profile for a \"revolutionary\" - because he is actually fundamentally unthreatening to those who currently hold the power (intellectual and corporate elites). Don't get me wrong - he is a smart and well-intentioned guy, and he has God's own reading list, and, if we are taking the mainstream of computer science as a starting point, he is clearly setting out in the right direction. It's just that he is not going to get us where we need to go, because ultimately no transfer of power is going to happen under his watch. We always have to bear in mind that when we are truly confronting power, things are going to get a bit ugly - power is never transferred without a struggle. In practice a lot of the systems we are going to end up building are going to look pretty undesirable to a lot of people who currently carry a lot of respect - if we are doing it right.
