This is a very specific question, but I’m looking for people in this space (tools for thought, personal computing, PL, etc, etc) who write on <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>. I’ve been doing more writing recently and want to start thinking in public a bit, which is scary to me. I’d love to know who/what else is on the platform so I can get a feel for the space.

So I have a substack, but have decided to go with Medium long term. I have made $300 this year accidentally so I feel I could perhaps nourish into a real income stream. I can't be assed audience building and I prefer working in public. I post all my articles publically but syndicate to medium privately, and they still make money. I've spent years trying things out, but I had a long think about what I have that no-one else does, and realised I have a lot of knowledge and a bird's eye view, so my most valuable resource is not my original ideas, but my ability to summerize what is going on in my niches as a domain expert. Discovery is a hard problem and I have that info so now I jsut write it down and it seems to do well<br/><a href="https://tom-larkworthy.medium.com/100-beautiful-and-informative-notebooks-of-2021-dc2362f7ccf1">https://tom-larkworthy.medium.com/100-beautiful-and-informat&hellip;</a><br/><br/>My other most read article is <a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/hacker-favourites-analysis">https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/hacker-favourites-analysis</a><br/><br/>So the data for me is fairly clear, aggregation and summary by experts is something people are desperate for. I am kinda disappointed my own ideas rarely get traction but on the other hand it utilizes a resource I already have so it's not actually that hard to do.<br/><br/>Sorry I can't help much about substack though.

That’s a good insight about aggregation! One if my recent favourite papers was <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/stephen-kell/in-search-of-types.pdf">“In Search of Types”</a> which did a thorough and careful job unpacking the term “type” and what is really meant in different contexts. Not quite a survey, but a style of paper I love. I have some writing planned for that kind of stuff, maybe I’ll do that sooner rather than later given your comment.<br/><br/>I don’t personally plan on making money, so Substack vs Medium seems to be a matter of audience. I suspect more people may read my stuff on Medium, but I’d rather have an engaged conversation with a smaller group of people.
