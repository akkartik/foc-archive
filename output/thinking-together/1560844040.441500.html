Leibniz could indeed have used a friendly Slack :wink: I actually think we have still similar problems today, that is organizing people and resources around  an idea. Open source brought a great leap forward in collaboration. But software does not exist in a vacuum. Because to see how even if you find people you want to collaborate and discuss with ( slack or others) the funding remains an issue. And there I do see that the whole crypto/Blockchain space can provide value.
