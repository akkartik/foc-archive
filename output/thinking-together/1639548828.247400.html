Hi it came up in <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nick Smith</span> community meeting that it's hard to figure out: what represents the groups contemporary thought or greatest hits. Slack can be a bit ephemeral, so is there a way of surfacing and curating info for longer? <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Orion Reed</span> suggested using emjoi reactions as a signal to direct a slack bot.<br/><br/>I see this same problem in the Observable community where the best notebooks get lost after they fall off the /trending page. People are individually curating "amazing notebooks" collections but individuals run out of impetus at some point so the efforts are patchy.<br/><br/>I have been thinking about solving this for the Observablehq community for a while. Some kind of system to submit URLs to notebooks and a way of tagging them -&gt; leaderboard with voting dynamics. Its basically reddit but scoped to a single domain. I do not have a good handle on the details though, how to incentivize long term content (vs reddit which is very churny)<br/><br/>Anybody got any other ideas or inspirations. Community curation seems like a common problem. Is there a solution? Does someone want to give me direction on what they would like to see?

My feeling is that voting mechanics are fundamentally at odds with deep and sustained collaborative work.

I think the wiki model is the best I’ve seen for this kind of thing. Ncatlab is a great example.

The problem with voting based system is that they subordinate their ordering to popularity metrics which means fashion rules. It’s too common for unpopular ideas to be critical/decisive but end up overlooked for lack of popularity. In fact, this is a lot of the reason we’re in the current mess we’re in, afaict.

The group blog is also nice, but for different purposes than the organization of deep collaboration. The n-category cafe is a good example of the success of this I think! Or lambda the ultimate.

yeah maybe voting is not a great idea. The part that was more interested in is indexing niche interests through group tagging, so you can find what interests you.<br/><br/>I see ncatlab has some kind of topic cross linking which is helpful for exploring and discovery.<br/><br/>n-category cafe doesn't have anything, on my initial look it doesn't seem to be particularly discoverable, am I missing something?<br/><br/>In the observable world  notebook is the unit of content (which is very close to a blog post). In FoC a slack thread is the unit of content.<br/><br/>In ncatlab, articles are wiki and can share space with the index, which is super great for zooming around for discovery. Hmmm, maybe thats an important feature of wikis and something to carry over?<br/><br/>Thanks for the pointers they are great to think about what makes them great

What I've seen working in practice is explicit "top of the week", "top of the year", etc lists based on voting. I don't think you'll be able to usefully fit both new items and old good ones in the same "front page", but if you relax that requirement it gets easier.

yeah thats probably the simplest way of generating long term insights and providing a reason to check occasionally. Long term is difficult because you need to normalize against usage at each point in time too, Doable though.

We've talked a bit about how to turn the ephemeral stream of Slack (and others like it) into a more durable knowledge base on the # channel. Things have been pretty quiet lately, but maybe a good time to restart that convo?
