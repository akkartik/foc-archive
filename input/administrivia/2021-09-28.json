        "text": "Here's a big one. Apologies in advance to everyone for the unbidden rabbit hole.\n\nI think we need to rename the community. _Future of Coding_ doesn't aptly reflect what this community values, or the sort of work we do together.\n\n• We spend more time studying the past than we do dreaming about the future.\n• We don't care much about code — very narrow. We care more about computation, broadly, but also so much beyond that: art and culture, social dynamics, systems and power, physics, aesthetics, time, games, and more — and how all of those things relate to _the computer_ (though even that is too narrow). What we care about is very hard to pin down, because it's made of up of many parts that themselves aren't pinned down.\n• The name (deliberately, I believe) alludes to Bret Victor's talk The Future of Programming. Like much of Bret's work, this talk is a quietly scathing critique of the dominant culture of programming. I think that that aspect of Bret's work really resonates with folks here. But the name Future of Coding doesn't capture the fact that Bret was being sardonic. I see lots of people taking the name too literally.\n• Speaking of taking the name literally, it's really pretentious. There's a real problem with self-importance in startup culture, and with a name like \"Future of Coding\" we sound like a bunch of growth hackers. That ain't us.\nThis is the sort of topic where we'll probably never all agree on a single thing. Ultimately it'll have to come down to a vote, or someone will just have to pick something. It's like the \"let's move the community off Slack\" (which I'm still very interested in doing), which was.. a lot of work, and not fun, but important, even if we haven't actually made that move yet. I'm interested in keeping this community alive and active for a long time, so I think it's worth challenging ourselves to keep making the community itself better and truer to its own values.\n\nIn particular, I'd like to use this as an opportunity to challenge any sense that this is a community primarily for white startup dudes. We have that reputation, and it's going to take effort to shake it. This is an opportunity to make that effort.\n\nI'm opening up this discussion very broadly at first. Please share your reflections on why the current name is bad (or, hell, good). If you have ideas for a better name, that'd be fun too. If you have meta-meta level thoughts about whether renaming things is a good idea, that's welcome also. This is going to be a messy process, and that's fine.",

I'm interested in keeping this community alive and active for a long time, so I think it's worth challenging ourselves to keep making the community itself better and truer to its own values.\n\nIn particular, I'd like to use this as an opportunity to challenge any sense that this is a community primarily for white startup dudes. We have that reputation, and it's going to take effort to shake it. This is an opportunity to make that effort.\n\nI'm opening up this discussion very broadly at first. Please share your reflections on why the current name is bad (or, hell, good). If you have ideas for a better name, that'd be fun too. If you have meta-meta level thoughts about whether renaming things is a good idea, that's welcome also. This is going to be a messy process, and that's fine."

It's already taken by another Slack and unrelated (inactive) podcast, but I don't think that matters.\n\n• I like that it's a nod to intersectionality, systemic bias, power dynamics, and other topics that are of very high cultural importance that tend to be a bit siloed. I like that these concerns are increasingly emulsified into our community — not the center of our focus, but something that we are continually mindful of.\n• I like that it is easily about computation, but just as easily not.\n• I like that it ties sweetly into the name Thinking Together.\n• I like that it's not too on-the-nose, not too vague, not too narrow or wide. It's a bit of a goldilocks, to my taste.",

I have some experience with sociocracy (dynamic governance, consent-based decision-making),  I've given a few talks about it, and I would be happy to facilitate it if folks think that'd be better than a vote (tyranny of the majority) or someone picking something unilaterally.\n\nI do agree with <@UEBG0NPDK> though. It will take more than a new name to solidify \/ strengthen the community. Values \/ aim alignment sounds like a perfect next step (and happens to be one of the foundations of sociocratic circles).\n\nThat said, I personally don't feel particularly strongly about the name, good or bad, though I am currently digging the term \"Cybernetics\" (the original usage, not the sci-fi concept). Cybernetics as a name has the advantage of being simultaneously history-reflecting and future-facing. And I think it might actually be another way of saying \"Systems Thinking\" without the potential baggage?",

I think (a lay attempt at systems thinking) that this is the part all the research on tailorable software and community adaptation from the 90s (<https:\/\/tcher.tech\/publications\/PhilipTchernavskij_PhDThesis.pdf>; chapter 2) misses: a heterogeneous population with some expert programmers is unstable if there's no path for people to become expert. Over time you either end up with the experts leaving the group or gaining increasing power and growing unaccountable. (Counter-examples appreciated.)\n\nBut -- oh noes -- is auditability now going to have connotations of Scientology? This stuff is hard. I'd appreciate suggestions for alternative terms that have proved themselves resistant to connotation-drift the way \"conviviality\" has.",
