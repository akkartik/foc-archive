Please consider holding a workshop at <a href="Programming">Programming</a> 2025. Those of us doing independent research on software sometimes feel like we are rejected by academic computer science because our work doesn’t have the proper shape. In turn we tend to dismiss academia as a dysfunctional status game. Workshops are a way to bridge this divide between independents and academics. Since workshops offer little credit towards academic career advancement they are less subject to gatekeeping. The <a href="Programming">Programming</a> conference is particularly open-minded about the form and content of its associated workshops, with a pronounced fondness for the softer and more human aspects of programming. <a href="Programming">Programming</a> attracts researchers from diverse fields with open minds. Please consider this opportunity to enrich your community by engaging with both independents and academics at a <a href="Programming">Programming</a> workshop.<br/><br/>The conference will be in Prague, with the workshops held June 2-3, 2025. Further details are in the <a href="https://2025.programming-conference.org/track/prog25-workshops">Call for Proposals</a>. I’m happy to answer any questions.<br/>cc #in-london #in-germany
