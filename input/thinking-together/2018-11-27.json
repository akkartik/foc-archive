        "text": "Here is one idea I was thinking of this morning. Maps and GPS. Imagine trying to get somewhere knowing the name of destination but never really see the map that would include your position and position of your destination with things around and between? Imagine only having GPS that can take you point to point. As a human being what would you choose? Computer will be happy with GPS you provide for it. But you as a human being? Difference between human mind and computer “thinking” is ability and need for higher level of abstraction. So would you choose to have a map or having only GPS is fine? The fact that we stopped using maps in our real travel brought us into scenarios where education is more like having GPS without ever seeing a map.  Higher level of abstractions and creation of “bird views” in my personal opinion are really needed. Tools that allow such view, education materials that create such views. Tutorials, books, films, animation, cartoon books, computer games. “Maps” should be created.   Any coding requires  an Overview first, it helps to get the best path ( algorithm). Teaching programming needs to teach an ability for an overview of things by using an overview of things. ",

                "text": "In psychology, the human mind is considered to be a cognitive miser due to the tendency of people to think and solve problems in simpler and less effortful ways rather than in more sophisticated and more effortful ways, regardless of intelligence. Just as a miser seeks to avoid spending money, the human mind often seeks to avoid spending computational effort. The cognitive miser theory is an umbrella theory of cognition that brings together previous research on heuristics and attributional biases to explain how and why people are cognitive misers.The term cognitive miser was first introduced by Susan Fiske and Shelley Taylor in 1984. It is an important concept in social cognition theory and has been influential in other social sciences including but not exclusive to economics and political science.",
