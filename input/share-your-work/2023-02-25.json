Spacing, collection of similar methods, naming_conventions, line length limits, syntax highlighting, and splitting or merging files are all examples of basically graphic design and visual hierarchy (in addition to other things). In fact, the use of folder hierarchies could be an argument that all of our projects are at least somewhat spatial.\n\nFurther than that: a program file is a map from instruction order to time, which we represent spatially when we’re working by ordering our programs. We have function arguments immediately follow function invocations. The most common form of argument passing uses the horizontal access of text to communicate inclusion with paired characters ((), [], {}) and we even claim those characters can be divided into “left” and “right” brackets!!\n\nI think one reason this argument sticks around for so long is that nothing is “inherently spatial”. Atoms are just mathematical models. Maybe they represent something that exist in space—but when we refer to the model, you could argue that. i don’t know. They’re more inherently a model of mass and charge than they are of space. \n\nThe bottom line is that no one has a direct line to reality—we have human brains that get trained up from an early age to prioritize processing a huge number of vitally important experiences by arranging that data spatially—whether vision, touch, proprioception, pain, sound, balance, or emotive feelings etc! \n\nWho cares if programs are inherently spatial? Our brains are highly likely to think of them that way by default, and tremendously more efficient at processing and thinking about things that way. I do think that we’ll be able to find more than one near-perfect mapping between space and programs, but given our neuro\/experiential\/ergonomic advantage we have absolutely no reason to tolerate the level of hostility to people devoting time and energy to leveling up our visual metaphors just because the chips aren’t in on a thousands-year-old debate that boils down to semantics at its most base level and spiritual contemplation at its most rewarding! We have the moral imperative to do our best to empower the creative potential of everyone as quickly as we can before our civilization fries or bombs or sedates itself into a dark age in pursuit of private profit!\n\nhow’s that for demagoguery lol",
