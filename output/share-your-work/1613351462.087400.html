The Mu computer seems to be making its way fully off third-party operating systems. Here's a demo of some (fairly barebones by the standards of previous demos) operations of the live-updating postfix shell.<br/><br/><a href="https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-shell-20210214">https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-shell-20210214</a><br/><br/>If you're curious about the sources, start browsing at <a href="http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/baremetal/shell/line.mu.html">http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/baremetal/shell/line.mu.html</a>. The architecture is much cleaner than the prototype I was working with before. Functions contain lines, lines contain words, words contain gap buffers. Rendering a thing renders its constituent things. Render takes a top-left coordinate and returns a bottom-right coordinate. Each thing knows which constituent thing has its cursor, shows its cursor when rendering, redirects keystrokes to it as they come in.<br/><br/>That's the positive. On the negative side, my experience working with bare metal leads me to despair of ever getting a disk or network. I spent 3 weeks at the start of the year struggling to support a mouse before I gave up. I gave up not because it's impossible to build (I was almost there) but because it's impossible to explain to anyone, at least with my current level of development. There's just too much historical accident in dealing with ancient PS/2 hardware that modern systems continue to pretend to be. And PS/2 was supposed to be easy. At least there's a single lowest-common-denominator way all devices work. With disk and network even that disappears. You need to support umpteen devices. Which means anybody hacking on their own computer now will encounter hardware their computer doesn't have, and which they shouldn't have to care about. In other words, going down this road seems to lead only to where we already are.<br/><br/>So I've been thinking about what's next. The thought of giving up on Mu has crossed my mind. It may yet happen. When I started Mu I had programs I wanted to write. It was always a means to an end. Lately I can't remember what they were, and the projects I recall seem obsolete, overtaken by events. There does seem to be one niche where one can write interesting programs about the world without needing to actually, you know, <em>talk</em> to the world over HTTP. That niche is simulation. Building computational models. And it might even be particularly important to the world in the next few years, given the volatility and turmoil I see all around me. As a baby step, here's Conway's Game of Life in Mu without an operating system: <a href="https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-life-2021-02-13">https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-life-2021-02-13</a>. Sources: <a href="http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/baremetal/life.mu.html">http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/baremetal/life.mu.html</a>. For a while I used to implement Life in every new language I learned. Not sure how or why I stopped.

Have you considered picking a particular machine and only targeting that? It would simplify the hardware stuff.

The beginning of the thread of work that leads to Go's concurrency model was Pike and Cardelli trying to make multi-device interfaces nicer to build, specifically dealing with concurrency while supporting the mouse. Maybe it would be fun to harvest some of those ideas in the context of Mu?<br/><a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/squeak/">http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/squeak/</a>

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Knott</span> I've been reluctant to do that because it feels like it limits the number of people who can try Mu out, and therefore who I can collaborate with.<br/><br/>I've been counting on my fingers when I hear from someone who seems to have actually tried to run Mu. In spite of all my efforts to keep it accessible, I'm not out of fingers yet. So I'm loath to add new constraints. At some point it must make sense to just consider this path over-constrained and go do something else. (Or maybe it means I haven't found the right vein of potential collaborators to tap yet? Hmm, perhaps the right machine would help there.)<br/><br/>There <em>is</em> one option I'm reluctantly starting to focus on: virtio. This is apparently a driver that only works atop an emulator or hypervisor. Programs within the VM get a nice interface, and the VM translates it to real-world hardware (perhaps using a mainstream OS). If I go this route you'd need a cloud computer to run Mu :grimacing:

Hmm yeah. The only thing I could think of would maybe be a Raspberry Pi because while it is a tiny audience in some respects, you are more likely to get traction with it.

After reading this, I can start to understand why Alan Kay would say that "people who are really serious about software should make their own hardware". It seems like hardware is even more heavily "accreted" than software, which makes sense given how inflexible the medium is, and how commodified it has become as a result.

I had the same thought about constraining to given hardware.  But, regarding your fingers (!), I believe I am one of them, and for me the constraint was that it wouldn't run in WSL on windows with 64 bit.<br/>Perhaps constraining the <em>software</em> environment would help - to a docker container maybe?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Maughan</span> Thank you! Does WSL have Qemu? I wonder if baremetal would work for you.<br/><br/><em>Edit</em>: I'm out of fingers! 11 people have tried to run Mu. I'm probably missing a couple of other people like you as well.
