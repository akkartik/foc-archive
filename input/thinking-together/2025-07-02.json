I've worked on automation detection for almost a decade so I'll try to take a shot at your questions:\n• Re: Are there bots here?: let's say we count a bot as third party using one of the official slack's clients or slack's internal API endpoints that effectively pretend it's a human user (as opposed to for example scraper written by <@UBN9AFS0N>). It would be possible to mostly answer this given slack's logs and a few weeks of statistical analysis. Or with some clever challenge - response mechanism that would verify the client's &amp; it's environment integrity. But even then there is usually a grey area of users of accessibility tools \/ lurkers that are hard to distinguish from automation. So we're not in a position to answer this question. There are certainly no spam bots here. There may be some actors motivated by data collection but those would have to be very long term oriented ones since Slack's API may be a cheaper way to collect data. There may also be some account farmers but also unlikely as I've never seen any online offers that sell Slack accounts. Overall I'd bet no bots here.\n• Re: does it bother me?: yes. The asymmetry of knowledge &amp; influence that botting leads to is obviously very bad.\n• Re other points: absolutely. There are some cryptography techniques that could effectively stop bots right now. Secure boot chain of trust is one. Government issued keys are another. Both of those can be done in a privacy preserving way (using batch keys or zero knowledge proofs or trusted computing), but are typically misrepresented in online discussions as privacy invasive. It's hard for me to say whether that's ignorance or (puts on a tinfoil hat) organized influence campaigns. Bot owners are capable of strategic thinking.
