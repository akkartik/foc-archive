Hi all, long time lurker here. I love this community; it has so much valuable content and discussions; it also gave us confidence that we were moving in the right direction. As we are getting ready to launch what we (<a href="https://bitspark.de/">https://bitspark.de/</a>) have been working on, I want to introduce our company Bitspark. We started working on a VPL long before we knew that this community existed and where navie enough to not even search for prior art - doh’. We started from an observation we made as everyday programmers. There so much repetition, and you need to be highly trained to be a software engineer. We asked our selves what the world <em>after Programming</em> would look like. That was in early 2018. Since then, we created a VPL runtime (<a href="https://bitspark.de/slang/">https://bitspark.de/slang/</a>) in Golang, making heavy use of Green Threads (each node in the tree is a green thread all connected via channels). That gave us quite the performance out of the box (<a href="https://bitspark.de/blog/benchmarking-slang">https://bitspark.de/blog/benchmarking-slang</a>). We have had our ups and downs and doubts and in the process, went through three different (editor) UIs. And then, in early 2019, we decided we need to build a platform around the runtime and the UI to make it easier to access and run/manage.<br/><br/>And that is what we (soft) launch in early November.<br/>Why am I telling you this? We are looking for like-minded people willing to take the platform for a test drive and provide valuable feedback or provide feedback in any form or shape.
