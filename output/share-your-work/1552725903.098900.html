For comparison, I agree with #1/2/3/7, but I avoid C (#4/5), don't really understand how #6 copes with reorganizations (which I perform freely as needed), and am not sure what #8 means.

Thanks for reading!<br/><br/>8 is just saying I don't design for the code to be behind a pane of glass that others won't modify. That's it.<br/><br/>The reorganizations were point 5, and they're definitely C-focused. Auto-generating headers is a level of spoonfeeding that no other language needs.<br/><br/>6 is for trying to help others grok my codebases. Giving them some way to stage their learning rather than throwing them into the maximum-complexity state right from the start.

6 sounds like a reasonable teaching tool, except that people won't be used to it, so they might be like "what. the. fsk. is this". Personally I think that high-level documentation is really important, moreso than function-level documentation - explain the core concepts and how the code is organized, and people should be able to figure out the rest. (that's what I'd recommend to others - I have perhaps a unique bad habit of writing what is probably too much documentation!)

There's already lots that people aren't used to. When they're in a strange codebase, that's going to be the norm. Some number of people will poke at something and withdraw after realizing it requires a larger investment than they expected. Nothing one can do about that. (And indeed those two categories are often the same people, just shifted in time. I have to recoil a few times from a codebase before I internalize what I need to do and why and make a larger commitment.)<br/><br/>The metric for learning new things is often "how familiar is it?" when I think it should be "how parsimonious is it?" I think a codebase that relies consistently on 5 unfamiliar mechanisms/concepts/names/whatever is superior to one that relies on 100 familiar whatevers.

Yeah... but I guess you'll want to have some explanation of the unfamiliar things in a prominent place lest people run away screaming (well, silently screaming, because you'll probably never hear from them). I recently had a thought: although my Loyc projects are easy to build, maybe users won't realize that because so many other projects are complicated? So I added a dedicated section to my readme that says "### How to build: ### Open Loyc.sln in Visual Studio, set the build configuration to Debug.NET45, and build it!" [note to self: figure out how to build it on Linux/Mac]

I guess what I'm saying is, anything goes on the internet so it's important to show that your practices aren't just unusual/confusing, they're actually good/helpful.

Yup! I definitely think about this a lot. See the example runs at the top of <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu/blob/master/subx/Readme.md">https://github.com/akkartik/mu/blob/master/subx/Readme.md</a>.<br/><br/>The point of the example repos is also precisely to help make the unfamiliar more familiar. I'm not trying to convince random projects to use my build system. (That's kinda terrifying.) This post is a link that'll go to a few strategic places where I hope people trying out my other projects will encounter it.<br/><br/>I figure since nobody ever has example repos for playing with their build systems, I'm signaling that I care. I was assuming that an example repo would seem obviously likely to be easy to build and run. But now that I think about it, I'm not actually sure if that's a deduction everyone will make..
