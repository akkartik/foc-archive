Agreed! I think thereâ€™s a lot of good ideas swirling around here. From that perspective, I think my only take would be: rather than focus on bringing in more community members, we need to first figure out how to structure the community. As several have echoed in #administrivia, Slack is just absolutely not the medium. For example, I would love to be involved in this community as it intersects with many of my interests, but I find it hard to keep up with the chat and all of the channels. Ramping up the number of participants would only worsen the problem and I think long-term deter creativity if everyone gets drowned in the noise.
