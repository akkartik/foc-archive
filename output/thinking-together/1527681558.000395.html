Great aspirations here! The bad news is many people (sadly myself included) have had been fighting the good fight for decades now with only scars to show for it. I'm starting to think that we have a meta-problem: we lack an evaluation methodology which enables us to make incremental progress. You can't single-handedly build a whole new way of programming in a single stroke. Scientific progress happens because people build upon each other's results validated by objective experiments. But empirical experiments on programming have had very limited value. In practice we seem to judge programming research by "coolness". I conclude that coolness has failed us and we don't know what else to use. We must solve this methodology problem before we can make progress on programming. [I'm beta-testing this idea and would appreciate criticism]

First thanks for all the work behind Subtext - it's been really inspiring!<br/><br/>I'll find the idea of incremental progress based on evaluation methodology generally agreeable. I definitely agree that 'coolness' isn't a great criteria. <br/><br/>For criticism I have two points. First, science and research may not progress in clean incremental steps but in a somewhat haphazard ways - e.g. a big leap in the generally good direction may also include a bunch of crufty ideas. Then this could be followed by a series of simplifications to cut out the cruft from the useful ideas. Second, I'm not sure how an evaluation experiment would be designed to work around the 'familiarity bias'. It took me years to really get comfortable with the current (limited) forms of programming so there's likely a strong bias towards the familiar models. A significantly better but unfamiliar model may not appear to work as well in a limited evaluation experiment. Perhaps we need non-programmers to try these out?

Talking about meta-problems, one thing that comes to mind is this: when we are creating 'new ways of programming' what exactly are we creating? Is it an underlying computation model (~lambda calculus/actors), a UI on top of an existing model, or something else? Usually it is all of the above - does it mean the factorization of the design space here is insufficient or imprecise? To make incremental progress as a group, maybe we need a little more structure - some kind of framework and/or language to describe what part of the problem a specific idea applies to and might help reason about how or if different ideas interconnect.

As experienced programmers we’re kind of stuck on this local optimum where we built ourselves a pretty comfortable environment around typing symbols into text editors. It’s hard to reach other, perhaps higher mountains around us without leaving behind even some of the stuff that we take for granted as crucial infrastructure.<br/><br/>One reason I think we’re stuck is because we usually take approaches that try to build a full-blown programming language that has all the expressiveness we’re used to from currently popular programming languages. I believe a new paradigm needs simplification, and that needs to get rid of (hide) some of the expressiveness.<br/><br/>Another reason I think we’re stuck is that we usually want to find a better way to program for people like us — other programmers. But as programmers we have so high requirements to what we want in a tool that it’s not feasible to target ourselves as the primary audience. My bet is on a future audience of people who don’t even want to learn programming today, who will be able to construct applications from simple building blocks to create or modify the applications they use today to change them to fit their specific need better.<br/><br/>I can see data scientists who learn programming today, because they reach the limitations of their tools. And while some of them learn to enjoy it, many just learn it to get stuff done they can’t get done otherwise.<br/><br/>I can see designers prototyping user interfaces, but then in the end instead of hiring a developer, they just push a few more buttons in their prototyping tool and will be able to export a proper application.<br/><br/>We need to meet these new audiences halfway, and abstract away some of the complexities we today believe are necessary to get anything done. Even if that means “it’s not really programming”. And that doesn’t mean our symbol-crunching compilers and interpreters will go away. Just like you can still drop down to assembly (or C, which is also “dropping down” for many these days), we will still be able to do that. Potentially to create the higher-level components our data scientist and designer friends will use to get their stuff done.

Do we need an explicit methodology for objective analysis? Ok, so coolness is out. So, what about the success of a system? Don't people say "Oh wow, this computer was built with Objective C and even though nobody else uses it there might be something to it?".

Do we need to rely on a sort of explicit advertising? Maybe we just create something successful with it and tell people how we did it. And yeah, ok, maybe creating something successful isn't so easy. But then again, if we could create rock solid systems in an order of magnitude less time couldn't we (at least some of the time) be more successful than people working with traditional techniques.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Guido Bartolucci</span> This reminds me of Alan Kay’s STEPS project. It wasn’t an order of magnitude less time, but 2-3 orders of magnitude less code (that should correlate somehow). So they’ve done this and achieved to build a fully working multimedia system (as they called it back then; OS + apps) in &lt;20000 LOC, but somehow that didn’t take off or inspired other successful projects either.

I've read the STEPS papers and wondered what ever happened to the authors? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: But seriously, why did it stop? Did they run out of money and needed to get traditional jobs to pay the bills? If there are enough people pursuing this for long enough then someone has to eventually succeed, right?

I think the STEPS project ended officially after the allotted time span and the people went to mostly Y-Combinator’s HARC and Bret Victor started the research that is now known as Dynamicland. Alan Kay shares his opinion about getting funding these days in pretty much every later presentation you can find of him. I think he has given up the hope that fundamental research is fundable in tech at this point. You either build a product and get Angel/VC money, or you’re done. I’d think he’d say such an endeavor is not feasible in a typical startup lifespan, as it needs more fundamental research.

I agree with Alan about the timescales of fundamental research vs start-ups, that's why I left that world and am attempting to self-fund my research. I'm still not sure how long this will last but I'm looking towards the amateur scientists of the 18 and 19th centuries as inspiration.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> Great points, and that is exactly the direction of my research. But even still it is too hard to do it alone and we need to find some way to work together. <br/><br/>STEPS is cautionary tale: they tried to do everything on their own and put little effort into disseminating their results or seeking collaboration and engagement. So it had little impact.
