Honestly I was content to work on this on my own forever, but I started teaching my students Mech and I'm always blown away with what their imaginations dream up, so now I think maybe I'll have more fun shipping and seeing what other people write.\n\nAlso I have fantasies about making Matlab obsolete, but that's never going to happen if I don't put Mech out there!"
