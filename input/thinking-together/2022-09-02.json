In almost every scenario the goal should be to get feedback as early as possible. Ideally you can look at a program and know what it does just like you can look at text in a book and know what it says. In many large programs it is difficult to run all of the code through a debugger, sometimes taking double digit numbers of minutes. For example, major games take minutes to compile, run, and load into maps.\n\nThere are certainly use cases where you can lean more on a debugger, like scripting. Even in these scenarios most developers prefer to be able to look at code and know what it does rather than have to run it through a debugger.",

Ideally you can look at a program and know what it does just like you can look at text in a book and know what it says. In many large programs it is difficult to run all of the code through a debugger, sometimes taking double digit numbers of minutes. For example, major games take minutes to compile, run, and load into maps.\n\nThere are certainly use cases where you can lean more on a debugger, like scripting. Even in these scenarios most developers prefer to be able to look at code and know what it does rather than have to run it through a debugger."

I don't claim you are making one of these arguments but they are interesting to think about:\n• A language which is easy to \"run in your head\" but has no debugger.\n• A language which is hard to \"run in your head\" but has a great debugger.\nI think its clear people would prefer the first bullet in most contexts. Though obviously a powerful debugger is an incredible tool for building better programs. I don't mean to degrade debuggers or claim they aren't useful. Rather, I think its worth aspiring to improving what can be done in the compiler\/interpreter input before considering improvements provided by a debugger. Truthfully many of the tradeoffs may simply come out in difficulty of implementation. If it takes weeks to implement a complier feature vs days to implement a debugger feature that prevents a similar error, its probably better to focus on the debugger.\n\nAll else being equal though, I believe it is better to \"verify things by looking at them\" as I put it, even if human brains are lossy. The debugger comes in when the human brain fails... that doesn't mean the human brain should be replaced by it entirely though. The brain is what you are thinking with. Anything else, like a debugger, requires us using our much slower physical appendages to interact with.",

Though obviously a powerful debugger is an incredible tool for building better programs. I don't mean to degrade debuggers or claim they aren't useful. Rather, I think its worth aspiring to improving what can be done in the compiler\/interpreter input before considering improvements provided by a debugger. Truthfully many of the tradeoffs may simply come out in difficulty of implementation. If it takes weeks to implement a complier feature vs days to implement a debugger feature that prevents a similar error, its probably better to focus on the debugger.\n\nAll else being equal though, I believe it is better to \"verify things by looking at them\" as I put it, even if human brains are lossy. The debugger comes in when the human brain fails... that doesn't mean the human brain should be replaced by it entirely though. The brain is what you are thinking with. Anything else, like a debugger, requires us using our much slower physical appendages to interact with."
