Hey, we’re looking for someone to help us prototype a 2D side-scroller game for a school for children with disabilities. The idea is that actions in the game can have real world effects, like turning on the lights. (Gig is US-only unfortunately, due to grant funding restrictions).<br/><br/>Prototype overview:<br/>• basic single player 2D platformer mechanics (move, jump, item/platform interactions)<br/>• browser based interface built with PixiJS or Three.js<br/>• deployed on local network; server controls light bulbs via LIFX LAN API<br/>• remappable keyboard/mouse controls<br/>• three short levels showing basic navigation, control of in-game lights, and control of LIFX lights<br/>• basic in-game level editor mode<br/>We’re looking for someone who’s handy with a WebGL framework like PixiJS or Three.js. Even though this prototype will be fairly simple, experience developing &amp; deploying a fast-paced multiplayer game is a plus, as it’s important for interactions to be fluid and game state/networking to be robust. If the future of coding tie-in isn’t immediately apparent, don’t worry I can talk your ear off about that :smile:. Let me know if you’re interested or know someone who might be!
