        "text": "Hi all. I just finished listening to the episode, \"Interpreting the Rule(s) of Code by Laurence Diver\". I wasn't sure it was going to hook me, but am so glad it did. I had a few thoughts bounce around as I was listening, though dog-walking on a trail. Hopefully they make some sense now.\n\nWhere Ivan was talking about the problem of a program only being able to handle conditions for which it was designed, with no escape hatch, I wondered about exposing something like the restarts that Common Lisp has in its REPL. This probably isn't something you would offer to a user that you didn't trust with a REPL, but perhaps encountering a problem could default to selections of alternate solutions that are offered to the user. When restarts are offered in CL, the program execution is paused, so the choices for the user have all the context of what is on the stack at the time. Rather than just aborting (which is one option), one might take an extra step back and try something different. Web checkouts typically have a weak form of this, but I thought that perhaps very binary conditional checks could often be replaced with \"one of\" or combinations of options. Don't have that right address? (RR 2, Pfff!). Include some other means of providing a location that is accepted. Maybe some form of fuzzy logic, albeit unfashionable these days, guides the programmer into accepting a combination of responses that satisfy their fraud-prevention algorithm when taken together.\n\n<https:\/\/malisper.me\/debugging-lisp-part-4-restarts\/>\n\nAlso, the whole concern makes me think of the eventual corporate destination, \"Computer Says No\" from Little Britain. <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CmjGUbZyopY>",

I wasn't sure it was going to hook me, but am so glad it did. I had a few thoughts bounce around as I was listening, though dog-walking on a trail. Hopefully they make some sense now.\n\nWhere Ivan was talking about the problem of a program only being able to handle conditions for which it was designed, with no escape hatch, I wondered about exposing something like the restarts that Common Lisp has in its REPL. This probably isn't something you would offer to a user that you didn't trust with a REPL, but perhaps encountering a problem could default to selections of alternate solutions that are offered to the user. When restarts are offered in CL, the program execution is paused, so the choices for the user have all the context of what is on the stack at the time. Rather than just aborting (which is one option), one might take an extra step back and try something different. Web checkouts typically have a weak form of this, but I thought that perhaps very binary conditional checks could often be replaced with \"one of\" or combinations of options. Don't have that right address? (RR 2, Pfff!). Include some other means of providing a location that is accepted. Maybe some form of fuzzy logic, albeit unfashionable these days, guides the programmer into accepting a combination of responses that satisfy their fraud-prevention algorithm when taken together.\n\n"

Arguably microblogging is not a cozy activity.\n\nI start wondering what \"walled garden\" means. I don't think it means, \"nobody can get in.\" Facebook has had pretty terrible security at various points in its life, to the extent that other companies were able to crawl vast swathes of it. Rather, in a walled garden information is being created within at such a prodigious rate that it takes a lot of resources for an attacker to keep up. Walls are for the plebes. So \"walling off against Facebook\" seems like an ill-posed idea.\n\n(I'm basically regurgitating <https:\/\/blog.bloonface.com\/2023\/07\/04\/the-fediverse-is-a-privacy-nightmare>, except I think the Fediverse is a privacy nightmare exactly to the extent that Facebook or Twitter is.
