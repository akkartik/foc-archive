This video is actually a fantastic example of what bothers me about modern 3d animation. Here's <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zbzzbAxpOaA|a similarly short video> showing some of the fun silly things you can do with pencil and paper. Where are the 3d animation tools designed to help you be _that_ freeform? Where are the animators pushing hard against the design of typical 3d animation tools in an attempt to make _that_ sort of thing? The difficulty lies in the bias typical 3d tools have toward reality. Pencil and paper have no such bias. It's a tradeoff — rendering photoreal animation is hard with pencil and paper, to put it mildly, so the bias is justified. But I'd love (love!) to see computer animation tools designed with a different bias. Flash, Toonboom, et al had a different bias, and did some wonderful things. I want more!\n\n&gt; The :open_mouth: of learning that the Circle of Fifths is a hack <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pythagorean_comma>.\nYeah… sigh. It's like the incompleteness theorem of music. Heartbreaking — I can't have properly tuned octaves and fifths. I can't have properly tuned fifths and major thirds. I do lay awake, staring at the ceiling, lamenting this. I do think about writing music software that helps me write\/record music where the tuning system changes on a chord-by-chord basis throughout a piece — sort of like what <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5vrhKI7JHQc&amp;t=1005s|Jacob Collier does here>, but to an even greater extent (because, unlike Jacob, I have a terrible sense of tuning but the ability to write software to help me overcome it, hah)",

It's a tradeoff — rendering photoreal animation is hard with pencil and paper, to put it mildly, so the bias is justified.

        "text": "_An_ animation frustration is that 3d animation tools expect the topological structure of your model to remain relatively constant from one frame to the next. Creating a single frame where you have an extra limb, or morphing\/transforming from one kind of object (eg: a rigged character) into a different kind of object (eg: a landscape) is _hard_. The tools that normally assist your animation (eg: character rigs) now work against you.\n\n_An_ animation frustration is that what traditional cartoons achieved with smear frames, 3d animations achieve with motion blur. This is so pervasive that if you look around for examples of smear frames in 3d cartoons, you only see frames with motion blur (and maybe a little squash \/ stretch, which isn't too unusual or tricky since the mid 00s, [caveat, caveat, etc]). Smear frames are beautiful and wildly expressive and are created lovingly, individually. Motion blur is pretty much an automatic \"How much do you want?\" algorithm. The motion blur in Pixar looks the same as the motion blur in Dreamworks looks the same as the motion blur in fucking Earwig and the Witch. Not true of smear frames from classic Disney vs WB vs (etc).\n\n_An_ animation frustration is that 2d animation tools let you work frame-by-frame, or use tweens. Tweens are ugly by default, and _fine_ at best. Frame-by-frame is the only way to make transcendently _beautiful_ motion. (There are exceptions, of course, but they prove the rule). But, frame-by-frame is only moderately better on a computer than it was when done on paper. There are probably tremendous gains to be had by improving how computers help you do frame-by-frame animation (<https:\/\/www.iorama.studio\/looom|Looom> comes to mind), and by improving tweens.\n\nFor all of the above, it's worth noting that I'm talking very much about the way things move and change over time. I'm not talking about what those things are, or what they look like when stationary. That's a whole separate area — another rant for another podcast, perhaps.",
