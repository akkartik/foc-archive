Hey everyone! <br/><br/>I am Nicolay. I run my own AI agency, where we are mostly doing more research heavy AI implementations focused on Pharma and Finance but lately also a lot of LLM and automations in the backoffice.<br/><br/>My main background is in LLMs, after I got hooked by GPT2 back in the day :D<br/><br/>ATM, I am also building a new startup on the side to stay up to date and current in the latest tech stacks. We are doing personalized news / content but B2B (competitor insights, market intelligence, tech insights, but also producing personalized newsletters for some publishers based on their content).<br/><br/>If you every have any more AI heavy questions in especially LLMs or traditional Ml/NLP, do not hesitate to reach out! <br/><br/>At the moment I am looking for a Frontend dev if anyone knows a good one (for a landing page).
