Hi! I’m Florian and I’m super grateful for the Future of Coding Podcast that I’ve been subscribing to for the past years. I’ve recently stumbled upon the Whole Code Catalog which made me so happy to see and get lost in it. Thank you so much!<br/><br/>Learning about the history was key when studying Interface Design. While following all the new things with design and development today, I’ve always found much more joy discovering what has been done already.<br/><br/>I’ve been developing tons of plugins for Sketch in the past up to the point that I’ve started developing my own design tool called “Ratio”.<br/><br/>After tons of prototypes, cycles and distractions, I’m currently returning to my original <b>mission of making programming part of a designer’s toolbox</b> and to build a tool that can be used by designers and web developers alike. <a href="https://useratio.com">https://useratio.com</a>
