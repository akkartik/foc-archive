Hey all, brother and I have successfully raised a seed round with <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/">Wasp</a> and are therefore forming a core team of a couple of great engineers! We are looking for experienced generalists, and we are working on fun stuff like compiler implementation, language design, FE/BE/infra/deployment, ... . Please reach out if it sounds interesting to you or if you know somebody who might be interested! Here is a <a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/Founding-Engineer-at-Wasp-88a73838f7f04ab3aee1f8e1c1bee6dd">full role description</a>.<br/>p.s. for those who don't know, Wasp is a programming language for building web apps with 10x less code: imagine Ruby on Rails but as a standalone DSL that plays with existing technologies. With Wasp, we want to make the future of web development more approachable and enjoyable.
