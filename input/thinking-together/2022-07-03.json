You cannot ask it \"what if\" questions or run it with a different set of data or assumptions. \n\nA video call is a dynamic medium because you can explain something and I can ask you questions about it.\n\nI don't know if there is one maximally dynamic medium, or if what constitutes being maximally dynamic might vary based on domain, or if there is even a limit to how dynamic a medium can be.\n\nIn general, I think there is a consensus that any dynamic medium not involving direct personal interaction gives the person creating a message the ability to program, and gives the person receiving the message the ability to run that program. Ideally, it also gives the recipient the ability to modify the program.\n\nThere is also, in general, a belief that ideally modifications can be made while the program is being run, without having to change into a separate authoring mode.\n\nBeyond those general principles, there is a lot of variation in opinions about the best way to let the user manipulate, observe, and interact with the message\/simulation\/program.",

You cannot ask it \"what if\" questions or run it with a different set of data or assumptions. \n\nA video call is a dynamic medium because you can explain something and I can ask you questions about it.\n\nI don't know if there is one maximally dynamic medium, or if what constitutes being maximally dynamic might vary based on domain, or if there is even a limit to how dynamic a medium can be.\n\nIn general, I think there is a consensus that any dynamic medium not involving direct personal interaction gives the person creating a message the ability to program, and gives the person receiving the message the ability to run that program. Ideally, it also gives the recipient the ability to modify the program.\n\nThere is also, in general, a belief that ideally modifications can be made while the program is being run, without having to change into a separate authoring mode.\n\nBeyond those general principles, there is a lot of variation in opinions about the best way to let the user manipulate, observe, and interact with the message\/simulation\/program."
