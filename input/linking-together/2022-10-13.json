Just need to know the linear order of the leaves? I feel like my editor should be able to and I wonder if I'm not seeing something.. Of course there's the question of how to expose it to the user..\n\nAnother thing that I've been thinking regards this is whether disassembling the whole expression\/body is prefereable in all cases or would you still want keep parts of it as terms and therefore be able to render term specific UI in between the linear parts. Like, what if there's a multi dimensional array in your expression that is always rendered with a specific UI and can't reasonably be disassembled to linear parts..\n\nLastly, I wonder how much of the cases where it feels that disassembling is beneficial are due to the pro-code like syntax and because the editing patterns that people are used to. Btw, did the users in Tylr's study have programming experience? What if the braces wouldn't exist (or were just decorators) and user would just select the two arguments and press\/click right twice to move them to be the last arguments of the first function?",
