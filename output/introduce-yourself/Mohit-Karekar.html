Hello! I’m Mohit, a software engineer in Berlin, Germany. I was introduced to the Future of Coding community through <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Maggie Appleton</span>’s amazing essays while browsing the Internet and reading about <em>digital gardens</em> on Twitter. I was so excited to finally put words to something I enjoyed working with for a long time since I was in tech! Absolutely love the FoC podcast and the takes on various papers. I have previously <a href="https://mohitkarekar.com/posts/2021/unipipe-executor/">tinkered with visual programming</a> and I go back to the project frequently to add features or draw some learnings from it.<br/>My work is majorly in JS/TS and I work in a web platform team; I have always enjoyed working on meta products that let other people build on top of them (and hence my interest in language tools and this community). I also am inclined to use such models to make programming more accessible (esp. in remote parts of my home country (India)) and I like reading any research on these lines. In fact, the podcast has made me more interested in <a href="https://aboutcomputingsystems.substack.com/p/about-computing-systems-a-newsletter">reading research</a> and knowing more about computing history, and through it how it will look in the future.<br/>Looking forward to engaging with the community and attending any events that happen in/around Berlin. Would love to meet some of you!
