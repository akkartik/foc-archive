Hiya, I just read this new newsletter from Ink'n'Switch:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/newsletter/dispatch-001/">https://www.inkandswitch.com/newsletter/dispatch-001/</a><br/><br/>And it says:<br/><br/>&gt; Solo independent researchers we know often discuss the challenge of working alone. Being part of a research group can create community, social accountability, provide feedback, and just give you someone to talk to when you’re feeling stuck or bored. This is why we started our Researchers-in-Residence program.<br/>Which made me think "this could be something we set up in FoC!"<br/><br/>And then I came right here to say that, without thinking it through any further...

The one thought I did have was that an issue would be timezones, so why don't we put our timezones on our profiles, or even alongside our names! I'm doing that now to see what it looks like

I don't really see the appeal of an always on group video call, but if I'd spend more than 5 minutes eating lunch, I could imagine my self dropping by a lunch session video call. I could maybe see my self wearing my wireless headset while preparing lunch and eating and participate in a lunch group call for random chit-chat.

As someone currently working at I&S, let me add some detail about how the researcher-in-residence program works.<br/><br/>They invited 3 researchers. One of them dropped out from the program when they joined a research lab. (Hey wait — that was me!) The other two researchers work highly independently. But, when they write a new note, or record a demo video, they share it in a private I&S discord channel so that other folks at the lab can offer feedback. These researchers also sometimes join the weekly Monday+Friday staff calls so they can briefly share what they're up to, just to keep the rest of the lab up to date. The residence is not paid, and the primary benefit (so far) is that you get to use the lab staff as "study buddies" so to speak.<br/><br/>In short, it's basically like a smaller, less casual version of what we already do with #devlog-together, #two-minute-week, and #share-your-work.<br/><br/>There's no always-on video calls that people drop in and out of. There's no obligation for anyone at the lab to give feedback. Quite the opposite — it's an opportunity for these researchers to write a regular series of short notes, and record short demos, and share them with a small group of other people who have enough context to be able to offer valuable feedback if they have any. It entirely depends on the researchers putting in the extra effort to make their work legible, interesting, and quickly digestible (which is good practice). It depends on the researchers having the free (unpaid) time to do all this work.<br/><br/>All that being said, if a small group of you would like to commit to each other that you'll regularly communicate your work in a way that makes it legible and quickly digestible, I'd be happy to spin up a channel for it. It'd be a dedicated space where you'd share and discuss your work with each other, and the rest of the community could sort of observe at a remove and perhaps toss in a bit of feedback if they ever had any.

It's worth pointing out that these researchers (Mary Rose Cook and Alexander Obenauer) already have a large, highly-engaged following for their work. They've already figured out how to present their work in a way that attracts interest, and they put in a lot of work to maintain that interest. The residence is not, like, a built-in audience. So if we set something up here, I urge you to not expect to get any more traction than your work already gets elsewhere in the Slack. It will get <em>less</em> traction, and that's the point — you're narrowing your audience to a small handful of people, so that you can speak directly to them. They're not under any obligation to respond, but hey, if a few of you strike up a good rapport that'd be fantastic. But the rest of the community almost certainly won't engage as much as they would if you continue to use the existing channels.<br/><br/>(I'm adding all this couching and hand-wringing because, Duncan, you often complain about people not engaging with things here. So I want to very clearly dissuade you from looking at this idea as a way to bolster engagement.)

I'm picking up that it wouldn't be all that welcome overall.

There is already overlap in #devlog-together, #two-minute-week, and #share-your-work as you say, so adding a fourth does seem a bit silly in retrospect. Having said that, I'm now wondering why not combine our current three into one - #work-and-show or something! I couldn't tell you on the spot all the differences between these three and I suspect I wouldn't be alone in that.

Though, it seems devlog-together isn't documented there. Let me rectify that.

Again, your reply is confusing to me. I wasn't asking for a description of the three channels, I was pointing out the fact that they seem (as a fairly regular visitor to the site who has some experience of their actual content and find the names quite familiar now) conceptually close to the point of overlap. (And I doubt there are many handbook surfers here - it's like reading the instruction book or agreeing to the Ts&amp;Cs, most just wing it.) So I was arguing down my own suggestion of yet another channel and throwing out the opposite idea, to consolidate them, (not that I actually thought that was a particularly good idea). So my posts are capitulation to the resistance. I don't think there's much more to say on the topic, now.

Can we take a look at how their effort is going now? I love this idea, but I have also struggled to implement something like it that could be self sustaining in anyway

Happy to answer questions, though <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Lu Wilson</span> might also want to weigh in, since they're now also doing a research residency at I&amp;S.

hey it's going great for me.<br/><br/>the main appeal for me is that I get feedback on my work from people in the field with massive amounts of experience and credibility. Normally I just get "it's amazing" or "it sucks" so it's helpful to get something more fine-grained from the experts.<br/><br/>it's also been excellent practice for giving talks and demos. I've done four internal ones so far and learned a lot from it. It's a "tough crowd" compared to what I'm used to, and it's a valuable challenge for my work and career<br/><br/>It's an additive thing - not a replacement for other communities. I've shared my 'ink & switch' work here in this slack, on mastodon, on twitter, on discord communities, on hackernews (a vile website), in DMs, and on video calls with other people who work in this space. I gain different things from each place<br/><br/>Hope that helps shed some light on it, let me know if you have any questions
