Perhaps I should bring y'all in:\n• <https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/i1b6tw\/computer_science_was_always_supposed_be#c_2mffpq>\n• <https:\/\/forum.merveilles.town\/thread\/35\/what-are-computers-for%2c-anyway%3f-38>\n• <https:\/\/merveilles.town\/@akkartik\/107896035093628757>\n• <https:\/\/merveilles.town\/@akkartik\/108043961340591227> (and thread)\nThe conclusion I've currently arrived at is:\n• The kind of computers we have today prioritizes large organizations that pay people with money. The influence of this mindset is deep and infects almost all our tools. This \"computer industrial complex\" is often useful on short timescales, but it is also blind to a lot of the value people create with it. As a result, future decisions by the computer industrial complex often destroy value at people scales. \n• Right from the start (suspense alert), there's been a shadow computer with a different, more convivial purpose. Confusingly, this shadow computer often looks just like other computers. You have to look closely to look past the camouflage.\n• It's hard to see what people would do with these shadow computers if we weren't immersed in a world created by organizations. After some time thinking about it, I can't find a better answer than the one (drumroll) Vannevar Bush arrived at, right at the start: one thing convivial computers are _definitely_ for is to externalize our brains. Paper expands memory. Computers expand both memory and modeling.\nThis is a surprising, even shocking, conclusion for me to arrive at. I've always slightly looked down my nose at all the \"tools for thought\" conversations in this Slack. It's felt too close to productivity porn most suitable to avoid doing anything productive. Suddenly they're super relevant.\n\nBut it's not enough to build more tools for thought. We have to think also about the process by which they're built. We have to ensure that the people-factory generating the convivial iPhone is also convivial. Because if it isn't, the conviviality will be short-lived as organizations kill or coopt it for their needs. The most important property to preserve, IMO, is to keep the raw code as naked and free from packaging as possible. It should be literally begging to be opened, inspected, tinkered with. Most software today fails to fit this bill. C programs come without source code by default. Browsers require big honking machines to be built from source. We write lovely naked Ruby code but then package it up into gems that go hide in some system directory where nobody can go look inside them.\n\nThis is what _my_ future of software looks like.",

We have to ensure that the people-factory generating the convivial iPhone is also convivial. Because if it isn't, the conviviality will be short-lived as organizations kill or coopt it for their needs. The most important property to preserve, IMO, is to keep the raw code as naked and free from packaging as possible. It should be literally begging to be opened, inspected, tinkered with. Most software today fails to fit this bill. C programs come without source code by default. Browsers require big honking machines to be built from source. We write lovely naked Ruby code but then package it up into gems that go hide in some system directory where nobody can go look inside them.\n\nThis is what "

                "text": "In sociology of scientific knowledge, Planck's principle is the view that scientific change does not occur because individual scientists change their mind, but rather that successive generations of scientists have different views.\nThis was formulated by Max Planck:\nA new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it ...An important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul. What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the ideas from the beginning: another instance of the fact that the future lies with the youth.\nInformally, this is often paraphrased as \"Science progresses one funeral at a time\".  \nPlanck's quote has been used by Thomas Kuhn, Paul Feyerabend and others to argue that scientific revolutions are non-rational, rather than spreading through \"mere force of truth and fact\". It has been described as Darwinian rather than Lamarckian conceptual evolution.Whether age influences the readiness to accept new ideas has been empirically criticised. In the case of acceptance of evolution in the years after Darwin's On the Origin of Species, age was a minor factor. On a more specialized scale, it also was a weak factor in accepting cliometrics. A study of when different geologists accepted plate tectonics found that older scientists actually adopted it sooner than younger scientists. However, a more recent study on life science researchers found that following the deaths of preeminent researchers, publications by their collaborators rapidly declined while the activity of non-collaborators and the number of new researchers entering their field rose.",

In particular, as group size increases groups have a tendency to focus on _short-term_, _stable_ profits. They're easier to defend in debate, and probabilistic investments become risky.\n\nIt's not just that ARPA gave us the internet while corporations couldn't. PARC at its peak was similar, and it came out of a for-profit company. I have a hard time imagining DARPA today accomplishing as much, though I'm not an expert.\n\nPower = Resources - Accountability.
