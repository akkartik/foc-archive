Hello everyone.  I am middle age woman who had many directions in life from studying math to becoming a visual artist, stage director and actress. Recently I am self educating myself on programming and facing the problem that I feel a lot of people will be facing since getting into “knowing” what to do with a computer and in the computer is unavoidable. There is a need of thinking in more abstract terms that would allow learning through common logic of human mind rather than education done in unfamiliar to non-computer oriented mind language that describes another unknown language that talks to unknown and sometime “scary” beast - computer. Languages I have learn so far are Javascript, Elixir, Python, (html,css ), some Golang. While I am introducing myself to languages I am growing in understanding on difficulties and trying to bring into my mind solutions how things could be explained in more “human terms” and logic. I hope participating in this group will introduce new paths for people to cross the gap from not knowing into knowing what to do and how to approach computer programming.
