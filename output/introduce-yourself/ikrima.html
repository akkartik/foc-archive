Hey everyone,<br/>I'm a gamedev at an indie studio and before my bg was in real time raytracing research. I stumbled on this community while researching the current state of the art of node editors for implementing my Nth node/visual editor.  My holy grail is trifecta of performance by default, rich visualization/debugging, and adding a procedural/scripting layer to tools for artists. Currently to me, the solution to those goals converged to imperative  programming with a functional core, relational code architectures (e.g. in games ECS over OOP). I just discovered "Language oriented design/projectional editors" which seem to be the final missing piece so I'm excited to dive more
