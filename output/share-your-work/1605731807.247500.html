<a href="https://github.com/rasendubi/meta">Meta</a> is the project I've been working on for the last 5 months. It's kind of a catch-all for my experiments on projectional editors, extensible environments, programming languages, and whatnot.<br/><br/>I've been through two rewrites. The last rewrite re-implements everything from scratch in Rust, including database, editor, compiler, vm, and even a GUI framework.<br/><br/>I have no impressive results to show (yet), but here is my journey so far: <a href="https://www.alexeyshmalko.com/2020/meta-1/">https://www.alexeyshmalko.com/2020/meta-1/</a>

Interesting stuff. I am partial to the entity-attribube-value triples so I think this is a good start.<br/><br/>&gt; Being honest to myself, I have to give up some of my language ideas and implement a simpler language.<br/>+1. I don't think the substrate language should have advanced concepts. It should be something really simple and other features could be added in higher layers

I like an idea of treating code as data. Stared your project on github.

I like the idea of EAV data as a building block for programming languages!

You might have noticed that my model is IEAV. Each EAV tuple has a unique id, so tuples are addressable, too. You can assign attributes and do anything you do with normal entities.<br/><br/>I use that to establish ordering of items, and I have a couple of other ideas as well. For example, you can represent diffs in IEAV by assigning added/removed attribute to tuples.

Yes I have noticed the unique id and I also really like the idea because this property makes your way of representing things a natural fit for CRDT like systems. I would like to use CRDT for offline first collaborative editing environments and I guess your approach will be perfect as a representation for editable artifacts that are managed by the environment, be it data or logic.

After watching that talk on Datalog for 13 minutes, it wasn't hard to believe that datalog could be a better database than RDBMSs. But I'm biased - I've thought RDBMSs sucked for maybe 15 years or so. It sounds like this kind of DB will automatically optimize itself by automatically noticing when it would be useful to have a particular kind of index... or something?<br/><br/>Datalog has 5-tuples (entity, attribute, value, transaction_id, delete_flag). What is the id in [id, entity, attribute, value] and why is this used instead of the last two items in that tuple?<br/><br/>You said that "a list of id-entity-attribute-value tuples is enough to model any data." No doubt you could; it doesn't follow that you should though. In his talk Norbert Wojtowicz mentioned that there were cases when he wouldn't use Datalog for something.<br/><br/>When I looked at your code:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">identifier(0) : Attribute {<br/>  Attribute.value-type = String<br/>  comment = "..."<br/>}</pre><br/>I thought to myself, as I usually do, that this was similar to <a href="http://loyc.net/les/">LES</a>. Have you heard of it? I'm just starting to ask people this question: (1) have your heard of LES or Loyc trees and (2) if you had heard about them, would you have considered using them (e.g. to make prototyping easier, or to separate the syntax of your language from its semantics)? Why or why not?
