I don't think I've mentioned this before (since?), but my goodness, wormholes are loud! Like, when you're going through one. I've only done this once(?), but my ears are still ringing. It's this crashing, whooshing wave of noise. This wall of force. It hits you, and then everything is gone. You come out somewhere else, but you don't know where, or when. You look around, but there's nothing to see. It's all dark. There's just sound.
