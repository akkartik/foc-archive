I'm just going to spill some thoughts here:<br/><br/>There are multiple aspects to making programming more comprehensible, or perhaps even properly doable in the first place.<br/><br/>The first obvious one is language. But even if you could have the perfect language, textual code is not the best for comprehending and manipulating complex models.<br/><br/>So then there's presentation &amp; modeling: perhaps some things are much better represented in a visually, or much easier to edit or build if working with a direct structure (rather than a typed out one). But if your program-flow is a mess or the abstractions are bad, then it's going to be hard to follow regardless.<br/><br/>So then there's the actual form of the program itself: does it lay out what it is and what it does in a fairly straightforward and obvious way? How big of a gap is there between a human understanding of the software, and how it reads? Do you have to reverse engineer the code to make sense of it?<br/><br/>All these things are essential: the presence of one cannot compensate for the absence of the other. For example, you can have a horrible mess of code, but that horrible mess can be diagrammed in a way that makes the exact nature / layout of that horrible mess immediately obvious. And having the flow and components of a program be obvious at a glance, does not mean that that flow itself is not convoluted and hard to follow in it's own rite. And likewise, a mass of textual code may do a horrible job of making a program easy to understand by looking at it, but the components and flow of the program may be laid out well and very easy to follow.<br/><br/>I have a couple points about this, but I'll have to save it for a follow-up post

What I am waiting for is an “IDE” which makes it easier to create and inspect the different “views”/“aspects” of your program.<br/><br/>It would be like Views for SQL Databases but for code: in that case only the “currently relevant” parts would be on the screen - like a sequence diagram.<br/><br/>As the code changes the “Views/aspects” of the code might change accordingly: or they would break totally: but in that case the programmer would be prompted to fix the View(s) which went broke.

Tests are quite close in terms of related parts: it would be nice to see the related <tt>production code</tt> parts together without navigating back and forth in them.
