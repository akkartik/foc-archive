What are people's thoughts on the future of no-code platforms with regards to open source? These days as a developer I see that languages where the only compiler is proprietary are increasingly niche, while widely adopted languages have an open source stack. Will the same thing happen with no-code platforms, or are the dynamics different?

I think the closer you are to the end user probably the more you can get away with that type of lock in

My hunch is that the model of Unity and Unreal — where the runtime is a closed source tool but the code and data you're working with are open and portable — strikes a better balance than what no-code is now where everything, code and data, are locked up inside the silo.

This is my main reason for not using tools like airtable and notion. I can imagine a sourcehut-like model where the code is open source but most people pay for hosting anyway because it's convenient and there is no lock in.

Microsoft, Google, GitHub, Amazon, Salesforce, Heroku, Apple, …. See a trend? Open source has it’s place in any business, some more than others, but it has zero effect on your business and customers of the product do not care, generally speaking. Don’t get me wrong, I love open source and promote it, however business-wise it posses little to no value. IMO most, if not all, no-code and low-code will have little to no open source software.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andy F</span> I’m sure those companies you speak of are not advertising or internally encouraging lock-in… they are more likely encouraging empowerment of their user base. The feature to add portability to the source of truth comes at a cost. Many tools in no/low-code provide a level of abstraction that have significant depth. Exporting that depth would result in wildly unusable serializations of data which is useless outside the system. That is the point: the more you abstract away the more tighter the “lock-in” becomes, which in all fairness to (I believe) 99% of people are more than comfortable with because they do not have the ability or desire to create things outside of that environment. It’s all about value in the end of the day.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Peak</span> good point re. the list of companies. I guess it comes down to, will companies brining on no-code platforms evaluate them like platforms (Salesforce/Heroku/AWS) where it doesn't matter that they are open-source, or like programming languages. I'd point out that even from that list of companies, TypeScript, Dart, Go, and Swift are all open sourced.

Having been involved in those sorts of discussions before, I think that lock-in <em>can</em> be an important detail on platforms. And despite things like AWS and Heroku being proprietary, there are drop-in replacements for S3 and things like Dokku with Heroku compatibility

Open sourcing the application side of no-code solutions is likely all downside for most companies - only makes ripoffs easier and makes customers constantly wonder whether they'd be better off DIY.

An interesting approach would be for a no-code tool to transpile the no-code into a programming language to run, and to allow the user to download that exported code. Similar to how some desktop UI builders (for C++, etc.) used to work.<br/><br/>This only makes sense if the transpiling step is a natural part of the no-code tool's design though; the further from code the tool is (e.g. Airtable) the less this way of thinking even makes sense.

Working at red hat I have some unique insights into open source and Nocode tools. By embracing open source culture it makes a really good developer story and makes it much easier to attract good talent, as long as the reason you are doing open source is because of open source of course, and not just saying you support open source to attract new talent as many companies seem to do these days.<br/><br/><br/>Open source is also a marketing tool now, for sure. However the term is so big now that it has actually become meaningless and ask 100 different people what open source is and you will get 100 different answers.<br/><br/>Anyway, for customers there will be many developers who say they prefer open source because of lock in reasons , even when open source locks them in even more. These developers are mostly advising the budget holders who do not care one bit about open source, only about benefits your software provides.

I think the best thing open source provides is that it makes it easier for customers to try your software , as they think open source is basically free, even if there is a restrictive license. They can say to their boss, we can use it, it is open source . If the software ends up being used the management will buy a support license anyway

I think that in the future being fully open source will be pretty much the ONLY way to get your project deployed on premise in a large enterprise in the future, IF the install is manual. The easier you make your product to install and not need developers, the less important open source becomes

But the issue of open source and nocode tools and whether it matters is more related to whether you think on premise installations done by hand will win, or fully managed downloadable software on prem or in the cloud will win . Just look at iPhone App Store as an example, hardly any of those apps are open source, yet enterprises spend huge amount of money on them as the install is very smooth. If it needed a developer to install an iPhone app then you would see a lot more open source iPhone apps

<br/>Overall though I see that open source no code tools only work if there a nice polished installation and UI on top, like out systems and mendix and Airtable and notion and similar tools. Yes if you look at any proprietary nocode tool inside you will see that 99% of the code is open source anyway, but that 1% proprietary layer on top which makes it usable by non techies is the secret source of those companies

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Paul Butler</span> What about data? You cannot transpire no/low-code that includes a data-store. What about asynchronous interactions? What about frontend domain requirements? The list goes on and on. You may have fallen in the idea trap of “everything eventually ends at C” but that is not true. There are things that no/low-code do that simply cannot be captured in a transpire/export — I would argue they are the exact things that make the no/low-code appealing. This statement also is also true for languages like Eve, Dark, Scratch, and other structured editor tools. You cannot export the experience, which is the most important part.

We are on the same page here :slightly_smiling_face: I’m not reading your comments as all-or-nothing; and I hope versa vise.<br/>I would still bark up the tree concerning the domain abstraction level preventing exporting may have a common graph; wherein there is a point where transpile/export is no longer possible (in full, not in part).<br/>I agree Excel is as you say it is, and indeed you can export the spreadsheet into code. This is made possible because the domain abstraction is not very high in the end. The line becomes really really fuzzy when the domain requires multiple systems in seamless collaboration. Excel does not have this.

Here's a story of lock-in in Open Source: <a href="https://blog.khinsen.net/posts/2020/02/26/the-rise-of-community-owned-monopolies/">https://blog.khinsen.net/posts/2020/02/26/the-rise-of-commun&hellip;</a><br/>Open Source is a safeguard against lock-in only for those who can themselves assume  maintenance of all the Open Source tools they depend on. Which is roughly Google and Microsoft, plus perhaps Apple. The real question is not Open Source or proprietary, but how much a user's application profile matters for the producer of the infrastructure, and of course the long-term survival chances of the producer.

While I agree people underestimate the maintenance burden of OS, there is a meaningful distinction in the degree of lock in. It's not about migrating, it's about tying your viability to another organisation.<br/><br/>If everything is open then it is possible to keep running an old version of something, potentially on old hardware, almost indefinitely. There are countless enterprises out there stuck on Java 6.<br/><br/>Obviously this slow death is not desirable, but IMO it is a completely different risk to say, Dark getting bought out and shuttered.

Or even just the difference between open, well understood data models and deliberate lockin. I used sublime text for a while, even though it was proprietary, because I would still be able to use it if the company folded and I would still be able to read my files if I stopped using it. Plus the extension api etc were well understood enough that someone would probably just clone it if it died. Similarly for using a proprietary service to host my email, because I can still backup my email with a standard protocol and easily migrate it somewhere else, or use third party software to read it if I don't like the interface. It's still a cloud service but I don't feel locked in.<br/><br/>I guess I'm happy to use proprietary tools when they are to some extent fungible.

Yeah, the question of whether no-code tools <em>have</em> a clearly describable data model that can be disentangled from their one implementation is pretty important. Like: software is the lines of code that define the software. Even Dark, you can imagine, because the text code is a 1:1 representation of the internal magic, that you could create another backend. Zapier-style tools, you can imagine a YAML/declarative definition of the workflow, like GitHub Workflows's YAML definitions. But then once things start getting visual… once you can move around nodes &amp; boxes, is that ineffable? Is it position metadata on top of a graph that could be exported? Somewhere in between?

Everything is just bits in the end. I don't think there is some ineffable magic that can't be exported in the data model. The important distinction imo is whether they are willing to define and commit to a data model. One of the defining features of the rise of cloud services is the end of backwards compatibility. Most cloud services own all the user's data and hide the internal details, allowing them to arbitrarily migrate code and data whenever they feel like. It certainly makes development easier and the lockin it generates is just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>Compare this to eg apps which store their data in sqlite which has a very stable serialization format and meta-model (sql schema), making it easy to access and understand that data in third party tools. Some cloud services do expose the same underlying api that all their front-end code goes through, which has a similar effect but still takes more work to interact with than a standard interface like sql. Perhaps the rise of graphql will lead to more of this kind of portability.

There's intentional lock-in, creeping lock-in, and explicit design to prevent lock-in, which involves in particular well-documented data models, storage formats, and APIs. It's much like code complexity: you have to fight it actively to prevent it from sneaking in.

Lock-in “creeps in”, because a lot of technology is commercially driven these days, and building on open standards just doesn’t make economic sense in a world where you need to own a platform to make money, or at least make it look like you will at some point in the future.<br/><br/>The groundbreaking technologies we still have as foundations, the internet, TCP/IP, HTTP, email, etc. have all been invented without business models in mind. What’s locking us in, and what’s keeping us back in inventing the future are the incentives set by business models and what is considered being successful today.

On the bright side, the desire to own your data is a very real one.<br/><br/>Which means there’s economic incentives to helping people own or duplicate their data from “locked in” services.<br/><br/>Companies like <a href="https://fivetran.com/">https://fivetran.com/</a> help.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> All true, but as I try to explain in my blog post, creeping lock-in can also happen in an Open Source project such as Python, with no business model. It is sufficient that the developers have some interest in increasing their user base, even if it's for glory rather than money.<br/><br/>Ultimately the issue is competitive development, rather than collaborative.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span> Sure, strong communities have strong opinions, and it starts to look a lot like a cult, religion, or whatever we want to call it. I would think that this is almost necessary to create a successful community.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the aspect of a project being open source is perceived as more important than it really is. Many successful open source projects are practically driven by commercial organizations and their values and economic incentives reflect on the direction these projects take. <br/><br/>At the end of the day the real issue seems to be about trust — do I trust the organization to not screw me over, go out of business, and stay aligned with my values? At least with the current commercial landscape you can look at the business model and get a good grasp on what you can expect.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> Yes, trust is a big issue. In small communities, it is based on personal relations. For business, the business model is a good indicator. For big Open Source communities, there don't seem to be good criteria for outsiders to develop trust.

Re. trust, I think open source software can act as a sort of "poison pill" here -- if a sufficient number of people lose faith in the direction of a project (especially a direction that aligns too much with the corporate steward of the project and not enough with the userbase), forking is an option. Forks are rare because they are expensive and destructive, but the fact that they <em>do</em> occasionally happen (Mozilla Navigator -&gt; Firefox, MySQL -&gt; MariaDB, OpenOffice -&gt; LibreOffice) creates stronger incentives for the corporate stewards <em>not</em> to mismanage them.
