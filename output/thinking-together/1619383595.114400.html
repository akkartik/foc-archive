This question isn't entirely thought through, but short of a formal symbolic understanding of calculus, could kids in a Papertian Mathland environment ever internalize the ideas of calculus enough to solve problems like the area under a cycloid or parabola? e.g. through the method of exhuastion. IIRC Papert talks about kids internalizing the ideas of calculus and differential geometry but its always a vague, blunt sort of intuition, that you can't solve actual problems with. My gut tells me that it is valuable to be able to have the sharper understanding that comes with being able to solve these problems. Do people disagree with this? If it is valuable to have a sharper understanding then how would "mathland" have to be different to enable people to solve these problems?

you could look at the development of eg real analysis as being a similar movement from people who had a fuzzier understanding of calculus moving towards a more formal understanding out of curiosity. not sure why the causal arrow for acquiring rigor can’t start from intuition and play—strictly speaking, novel mathematical advances always come from people without a particular formal background (because it didn’t exist) so they invent them. if you wanted to speed the process up in mathland you might ask a student how to estimate the volume of a conch shell, for example. and then push them to generalize with follow up questions

Oh, the causal arrow for acquiring rigor can certainly start with intuition and play, its just that I  don't see how you would get from that level of play to the point where you can solve hard problems. There is a gap between the intuition and rigor of a turtle mathland environment and what you do in calculus class. I like your example with the conch shell though. I'm picturing a turtle programatically running through some rectangular or triangular mesh of the region and adding up the volumes.

It's an interesting question, and one potential perspective is to see symbolic calculus as just augmented thought. The mathematical rigor and semantics of the system allows new discovery, but that isn't fundamentally different than more physical proxies. Many concepts in calculus aren't fundamentally difficult either when you break it down, and there's no real reason that children/adults of all ages would not be able to understand "difficult" symbolic logic when piecewise, the pieces are quite simple.<br/><br/>Given this is the future of coding slack, I think we realize the importance of well crafted, composable abstractions that enable us to augment our thinking (albeit in the computational context, an executable form of thought). If children were given blocks that could form other blocks, then there really wouldn't be a real barrier to something like calculus. I think one argument is that the threshold is if those pieces and tools they have allow that kind of expansion - something like pencil and paper certainly meets that threshold.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@em</span> I really like the perspective "symbolic calculus as augmented thought" and I wouldn't hesitate to read "calculus" in the broad sense either ("lambda calculus", "calculus raticionator"). Symbolic reasoning is awesome, but sometimes it has its shortcomings. A term I prefer is "formal reasoning". I'm not sure if a mathland for calculus absolutely needs symbols, but formal reasoning is a necessity.<br/><br/>By blocks do you just mean these abstractions you can compose with each other? Maybe you have a clearer idea how you could do this than me. On a gut level it seems possible, although I'm a bit puzzled then why we don't seem to have examples of work in this direction.

(tl;dr: <a href="http://worrydream.com/KillMath/">http://worrydream.com/KillMath/</a>)<br/><br/>I think Papert would believe that the most important things to get from calculus are the underlying concepts: "measure the rate of change of one quantity relative to another" and "accumulate one quantity as another changes".<br/><br/>These concepts give you a jaw-droppingly powerful language for understanding and modeling and predicting the world. I mean this qualitatively, but a rigorous understanding of this language also leads to differential equations, which underly essentially all dynamic systems.<br/><br/>When you say "solve problems like the area under a cycloid or parabola", my guess is you're talking about symbolically computing derivatives &amp; integrals. This seems to me to be vastly less important. (Especially symbolic integration! I learned so many integration tricks in high school which I have literally never used, even throughout an undergraduate education in math and physics.)<br/><br/>You might not mean symbolic computation, though! You might mean knowing:<br/><br/>1. how a shape can be broken down into small pieces [strips below the parabola],<br/>2. how this can be described as a relationship between quantities [strip height = f(x)],<br/>3. how integration expresses the assembly of these small pieces [area = ∫ strip height × strip width = ∫ f(x) dx]<br/>4. how hand-calculation or a computer program could approximate this integral.<br/><br/>I'm into all of these things, and I expect Papert would be as well.

So much to unpack.  Won't do it justice.<br/><br/>(1) Calculus as a class combines two types of ideas: (a) theory of limits, derivatives, integrals, (b) practice of fairly sophisticated formula manipulation.<br/><br/>(2) A Mathland focuses on giving students a feel for (a) theory.<br/><br/>(3) One can master the (b) practice without a good feel for how the manipulations are related to (a) theory. A lot of time energy spent on the product rule, not so much in getting a really good feel for what it does.

There are many examples of children intuiting their way to these things in Kay's writing. I can vouch for this phenomenon as I ended up reinventing calculus at around eight years old to write little simulation programs using 1970s era 8-bit computers.<br/><br/>Expanding on what <span style="background-color:#ccf">@William Taysom</span> says above, not only can the common notation and formula manipulation tricks can be learnt with little or no real intuitive understanding, but likewise the intuition can be learnt quite well without that notation. I would even go on to say that in most regards an executable notation is superior to the 19th century standard.<br/><br/><a href="http://vpri.org/pdf/rn2007006a_olpc.pdf">http://vpri.org/pdf/rn2007006a_olpc.pdf</a>

Hmm. When I think of "mathland" I think being embedded in an environment where you learn math through play as its primary feature, and its capacity to communicate the main ideas of a subject, calculus for example, as secondary. I also think of the concept as being applicable to every level of math and physics. I learn these things by playing around with them, and I find that some environments are more conducive than others. But all of these environments are theoretical ones existing in other peoples heads that are communicated through the normal symbolic, verbal, and occasionally visual channels. So I'm admittedly coming from a bit broader a place though. I just can't think of any other image that communicates the idea of math through play better than mathland, so I'm appropriating the idea to a degree.<br/><br/>Zooming back in a little, the main "feature" thats missing is proofs or an equivalent. I really could have asked what class of mathlands have these things. And the whole discussion could be much simplified by just considering Euclidean geometry for instance. And when I was mentioning the cycloid and parabola I was thinking of these as an extension of euclidean geometry, as done by archimedes and others before calculus. No symbolic machinery needed, but its probably all the harder for it and not at all realistic.<br/><br/>Another direction it can go is a mathland supplanting symbolic methods. Kill Math already provides some vocabulary for this, and I'd venture to say those methods can be just as powerful as the symbolic ones. After all, any variable is just a number that varries, and a function is just a number that varies with another number.
