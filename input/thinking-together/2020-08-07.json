Sticking with text mode is an extreme form of this, hopefully I can break out of that in time.\"\n\nI once wondered why text editors weren't better designed, given that they're the software that programmers make for themselves. But the more I've studied other software packages, the more I've come to believe that text editors actually are the best software that's ever been made. To make this argument, I'd put software like Emacs, Vim, BBEdit, TextMate, VS Code up against things like Photoshop, Excel, After Effects, Ableton Live. In my book, the text editors always come out ahead. They're more flexible, they're faster, they're more powerful, in that features can be combined in freeform ways more gracefully. The basic building blocks of selecting and operating on data works more fluently than in any other software I've encountered. Most of them can also be extended in powerful ways.\n\nWhat do other people think? What software is better than text editors? (That's of comparable usefulness, I tend to want to narrow it to software that you actually make something with, e.g., because some utilities are so focused they practically vanish. But I'd still be curious what answers people have.)",

Sticking with text mode is an extreme form of this, hopefully I can break out of that in time.\"\n\nI once wondered why text editors weren't better designed, given that they're the software that programmers make for themselves. But the more I've studied other software packages, the more I've come to believe that text editors actually are the best software that's ever been made. To make this argument, I'd put software like Emacs, Vim, BBEdit, TextMate, VS Code up against things like Photoshop, Excel, After Effects, Ableton Live. In my book, the text editors always come out ahead. They're more flexible, they're faster, they're more powerful, in that features can be combined in freeform ways more gracefully. The basic building blocks of selecting and operating on data works more fluently than in any other software I've encountered. Most of them can also be extended in powerful ways.\n\nWhat do other people think? What software is better than text editors? (That's of comparable usefulness, I tend to want to narrow it to software that you actually make something with, e.g., because some utilities are so focused they practically vanish. But I'd still be curious what answers people have.)"
