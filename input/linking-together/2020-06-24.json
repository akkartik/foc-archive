It wasn't until the class switched to java and we started writing to the console that it clicked what programming actually was.\n\nIt wasn't until I used XNA for the first time that it really hit me how cool programming was, though. Writing a while loop and seeing a box move across the screen made everything come together for me. If I were teaching someone to program, I think I would skip straight to love2d, which is, I think, a good modern successor to XNA. Possibly if I were teaching a really young child, I would use something like scratch or alice, but even then I'd be reluctant.\n\nI'm not an educator and I don't work with children, though, so its hard for me to say this with much confidence. I think it matters a lot if the child _wants_ to learn to program or if you're trying to trick them into programming.",

Writing a while loop and seeing a box move across the screen made everything come together for me. If I were teaching someone to program, I think I would skip straight to love2d, which is, I think, a good modern successor to XNA. Possibly if I were teaching a really young child, I would use something like scratch or alice, but even then I'd be reluctant.\n\nI'm not an educator and I don't work with children, though, so its hard for me to say this with much confidence. I think it matters a lot if the child "

The idea is to learn what coding is about, not  jump start your training to be a software engineer.
