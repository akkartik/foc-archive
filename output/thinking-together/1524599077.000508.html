Something like Tasker on Android is interesting because it exposes a large portion of the OS functionality (notifications, launch screen, etc.) without having to reinvent an "app" from scratch, and back to your point of Excel; it provides an abstracted level of automation to users that they've actually been able to leverage to a great degree, where something like basic Android OS widgets are completely inaccessible to the uninitiated. Tasker sort of addresses this but is still a huge barrier to entry.
