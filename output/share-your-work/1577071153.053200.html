It is fun to consider the future of computing, but people in the trenches who are trying to do basic automation need the basics handled as well, so i made an example in Beads showing the dynamic nature of layouts, where you can make a single form that adapts to whatever screen layout, orientation, and pixel density it encounters, so a single code base can run on desktop, tablet, and mobile. Mobile forms are tricky because the label moves above the field due to the narrowness. Anyway if people are interested in taking Beads for a spin, it is downloadable at <a href="http://www.beadslang.com/downloads/beads.zip">http://www.beadslang.com/downloads/beads.zip</a>. See the README file at the to level for installation instructions.
