I found this blog post on Stiegler (philosopher of technology) ranging from memory to technics very relevant to the milieu of tools our consciousness already lives in. <a href="https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/stieglers-memory-tertiary-retention-and-temporal-objects/">https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/stieglers-memory-tertiary-re&hellip;</a>

Was an interesting read, thanks.<br/>&gt;The systematic influence of mnemotechnics on individual human consciousness must therefore be looked at as political in itself; if we are to understand technics, we must understand how the technical milieu of human consciousness affects us collectively, as a ‘we’, thus affecting us politically. <br/>This really points at the political core of computing I think often goes unseen. Well maybe not so much unseen as deliberately ignored.<br/>I think the key takeaway here is that technology is /persistent/ and has long-ranging effects. As a creator, are you willing to take responsibility for your creation? Perhaps the more important question is whether you can even do so—is it a task even capable by humans? I wonder how much of the general disregard for these questions comes out of a sense of despair?<br/>But eh, I didn't really expect to be discussing philosophy here to be perfectly honest

The importance of technics with regards to time (just the influence of Bret Victor and how the concepts he espoused have flowed into many of the tools we use today, or ditto Haskell) can shed light on the importance of tools in shaping the thought of future users. There is a kind of consciousness transfer happening between generations using tools, and what is a better argument for tools for thought than that? :P

Some other usefull thoughts from Bernard Stiegler, is that each technical artifact is a pharmakos, i.e. it is both a poison, a cure and you have to take care of it, in the sense that it can be a destructive power. For example, writings as a technic can be an empowerment source or can be an alienation tool. An other obvious example is the web, with all the benefits and the obvious drawbacks (privacy concerns, advertisments overdose, etc.). Stiegler also says that a pharmakos has also to be considered as a potential spacegoat for those who are not able to manage the cure/poison balance.
