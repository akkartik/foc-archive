Hi everyone,<br/><br/>I'm Phil and I suffer from the same the disease that many of you do. I know, just know, that there could be a much better, much easier, much more powerful way to write software than the way we're doing it at the moment.

And I want to do something about it ... if only I could figure out what.

I muse and throw up random thoughts about this stuff both on my blog here : <a href="http://sdi.thoughtstorms.info/">http://sdi.thoughtstorms.info/</a> and in Quora answers, now aggregated here : <a href="https://www.quora.com/q/qqylyzqgpwisoecc">https://www.quora.com/q/qqylyzqgpwisoecc</a>

My first love language as an undergrad was Smalltalk. My weapon of choice today is Clojure. I generally like the stuff that I'm sure most people like : Lisps, Smalltalk, Parc, HARC.<br/><br/>My current thinking on new languages / areas of investigation / demands in my manifesto are these :<br/><br/>1) expressing computation is a solved problem. We have Lambda calculus, Lisp-like functions, Smalltalk-like messages. These are fine. We don't need to worry about these.<br/><br/>The areas we need to explore further are in expressing complex data-structures, "architecture" and constraints. My recent thinking on OO is that what makes OO "hard" is that we don't have good ways of expressing larger scale assemblages of objects. And there's too much focus on the individual class, rather than the collective of how classes or objects act together.<br/><br/>2) A second problem is that programming languages make us do the work in an order that suits them. Our job as programmers is to give a number of constraints to the computer that define a program. The problem is that the computer makes us give the constraints in the order and format that is convenient for it. Often requiring us to fit into architectural restrictions that we don't, in fact, care about but which are part of the fussy housekeeping of the system ... eg. why am I jumping between different files to fill in information about model, about view, about database, about client UI? Etc? Why can't I express what's important to me, in one place, in the order that suits me, and have the computer go back and wire these together?<br/><br/>The first of these thoughts is making me interested in grammars. And the way that ML or Haskell define complex data-schema with algebraic data-types in an almost Backus-Naur style. Can we use something like this to declare assemblages of objects? (See a discussion here : <a href="https://www.quora.com/q/qqylyzqgpwisoecc/Whats-wrong-with-OO">https://www.quora.com/q/qqylyzqgpwisoecc/Whats-wrong-with-OO</a> )<br/><br/>The second of these thoughts has me looking into logic programming in Prolog and Minikanren where we "flatten" our program into a sequence of facts and rules which can be added in more or less any order, leaving the inference engine running around drawing out the implications. (See my discussion with Alexander Tchitchigin in the comments of this : <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-programming-language-you-are-looking-for-and-why/answer/Phil-Jones">https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-programming-language-you-a&hellip;</a> )
