Hey folks, I'm Mohammad (go by Mo). I live in Ottawa, Canada. I spent most of my career in Product Management at Shopify. I left in 2018 to start my own business and am currently working on an idea that would best be described as "low code for devs, not no-code for non-devs".  Something like a bundled Firebase or the old Parse Cloud product Facebook bought, but way better. Hope to share a demo with you folks in the coming weeks and get some feedback, and just generally share thoughts and ideas around where development should be headed
