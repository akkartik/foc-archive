I like it very much! Yes, this is a great lens on one of the big issues that’s causing a lot of complexity in our field.<br/><br/>Some random thoughts:<br/><br/>1. I’ve always wondered why the Unix command line and in particular its pipe feature is considered a good solution and what makes it so special. I don’t have a final conclusion, but I suspect the “fuzziness” of the not very clearly defined text stream interface has to do with it. Every other data format you list tries very hard to be precise in describing data structure and even types. The text stream a sort command operates on, just needs agreement on the used delimiter. When specifying function interfaces within a programming language we’re by default already in a much more precise type system (even in dynamically types languages), which prevent that level of ambiguity (and break-ability).<br/>2. Human language also has this fuzziness: we can describe concepts without being sure that the person we talk to has the same definitions. Surprisingly, it works more often than it doesn’t, even though the receiver has a slightly different understanding than the sender. Programming languages break as soon as there is the slightest mismatch in syntax, grammar, or data types. We design data formats like programming languages. There’s is no room for ambiguity. By design. Maybe there should be.<br/>3. The pipe-able Unix text stream “type” is a very loose specification of a type, and it’s kind of monoidal in nature — everything going through a filter command line program ends up as another text stream. The required structure to make piping work is minimal and doesn’t even touch on what the data in that text stream actually is. That makes it extremely generic and composable. The parameters and return values in function calls are very specific and usually mix strict expectations on both structure and data type/format. By that we’re creating countless different API calls that are all not easily composable.<br/>4. #3 is also a not yet well expressed reason why functional/declarative is superior to imperative. Imperative code composes function calls over time (when to call what), and creates these huge, complex hierarchies and if you add concurrency to the mix it blows up even more. Other types of composition in imperative languages require additional structure in form of higher-level constructs like interfaces or design patterns. Pure functional composition and algebraic data structures allow a monoidal composition where you stay in the same category — you compose lots of things but yet they all stay the same type, just like piping on the Unix command line. There is some objective superiority in the functional or declarative approach (not sure yet which one exactly, although it could be both for different reasons) over imperative — by that I mean it can be objectively described and explained and it isn’t just a “depends on the context” issue. Unfortunately, I don’t know how to explain that yet. But the way composition works in these approaches is key. Imperative still has its value, but likely as an implementation detail between a functional/declarative high-level language and its low-level implementation on a machine. I know that’s controversial. Please @ me! :-)<br/><br/>I have lots more to say about this, but that’s already a lot to read so I leave it at that for now.<br/><br/>I’ve been thinking about this for a while, but more focused on data formats and structuring data and trying to stay away from the typical programming issues like interoperability for now. I came to believe that a lot of the issues we’re trying to solve are self-made and we need to break out of our own context to find better solutions.

I like the change in emphasis from duplication to composition models!<br/><br/>Your footnotes get inlined in the same column as the prose even on my laptop, and the result is confusing. The footnote for 'affordance' appears above its real usage, for example. If I shrink my font size I see it on the right column and it looks nice.

Switching to the substance: would the use of many 'e's in this comment worry you as duplication? What about the presence of a function for sorting on your computer vs mine? These are silly examples (hopefully you agree), but since you're expanding the range of duplication you worry about, I'm wondering how you decide where to draw the boundaries of what constitutes a 'system'.

"Is it really true that sort cannot be expressed in a pure form and decorated to fit into any context?"<br/><br/>If all of the contexts are only trivially different from one another, then this would be practical. However, "any context" covers a lot more ground than that. In the worst case, the decoration could grow to be as complex as the sort source code itself, and the decoration may also be tightly coupled to the details of the sort implementation. So you can have cases where it is simpler and cleaner to just reimplement sort from scratch for the specific context.<br/><br/>For example, if the context involves dependent types and program verification, then the sort algorithm needs a type which proves that the output is sorted, and that type will be tightly coupled to the implementation. If the context is Rust, then the sort algorithm is required to be memory safe, and must pass the borrow checker.<br/><br/>If the context is APL/J/K, then the sort operator needs to return a list of indices, not the sorted list itself.<br/><br/>What if the data to be sorted is distributed across multiple machines and is too large to fit into memory? What if the context is a pure functional language with persistent functional data structures? You need different sort algorithms for different contexts.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> - thanks for the detailed thoughts. Interesting stuff.<br/>&gt;  We design data formats like programming languages. There’s is no room for ambiguity. By design. Maybe there should be.<br/>This is something that I agree with. We need less 'gear like fitting' and more biochemistry like flexibility. You still have the receptors and tags that bind to each other but in general there's more flexibility in how coupling happens - and if something doesn't fit it just kind of floats around (where it can be observed) rather than crashing and terminating. I think tuple spaces kind of explore some of this 'tagged items in a pool' model. However I think really tight fitting couplings with little tolerance become harder to scale up orders of magnitude. Notice how we tend to be much more flexible in service APIs (protocol buffers are designed to be backwards compatible) compared to function types.<br/><br/>&gt;  I came to believe that a lot of the issues we’re trying to solve are self-made and we need to break out of our own context to find better solutions.<br/>Couldn't agree more :smile:

I'm not really against recreating stuff when you want to, but rather when you 'have to'. (Technically I could pipe stuff from my program into the <tt>sort</tt> command, but there's some serious trade-offs). I feel the composition models are weak where you 'have to' way more often than you should.

&gt;  You need different sort algorithms for different contexts.<br/>That's reasonable wrt the current composition models that exist. See my above comment about 'have to' vs 'want to'. The deeper question is what's possible 'in a completely new world'. As an example, if an operating system doesn't give you the freedom of free form binaries but just the ability to create pure functions and manages versioned state. Now even if you create languages with different source syntax they all compile to 'functions' and are then much more amenable to a different kind of composition. The point is that the OS substrate is providing the greater context within which Rust, APL and whatnot arise. In a completely different substrate, languages and these inner contexts would themselves look very different.

Perhaps a good example here are Lisp machines (e.g. Symbolics)? They 'material' manipulated by 'processes' in that OS are not byte arrays but structured data. So even if you have something non lispy that compiles into one of those lisp processes, it's external compositional properties are very different.

Regarding the unix pipe and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span>'s question. I see this as very similar to the Lisp cons cell. It is the smallest interface we could think of in order to build text and data processing systems. I think it is succesful because it allows your system to grow quickly (you can easily reuse existing parts to make new parts), while preventing an explosion of special cases (anarchy). I think it ties to the general problem of communication in systems. How to design the protocols between the parts to allow for growth while preventing failures. It is really a balancing act between freedom and control.

Yes I see containers as a composition model. In fact beyond a certain scale, the common model is you have some stateful processes as peers and they send messages to each other. Some focus on the naming aspect (e.g. services) while others focus on the reproducibility aspect.

Unix pipes, Lisp, Smalltalk — what’s the connection?<br/><br/>One connection I see is that they all offer a composition model that is based on just one type of component (text stream, S-Expression, Object) but these components can represent a vast variety of different things. However, because the composition is defined on the abstract type, all these different things can be composed in the same way. <br/><br/>That’s what I mean by monoidal composition — you stay in the same category / it’s all the same type, but it can represent many different values. Although a monoid might already be more specific (restrictive) than needed…?<br/><br/>Usually, we tend to categorize everything quite quickly into incompatible categories that do not relate to each other, or in less generic and more restrictive ways than a monoid structure. Then we need transformations, and interfaces, and spend a lot of time converting one thing into another.

When we write “glue code” to make different things work together, we work around the problem that composition of these things hasn’t been baked into the system. If it had been, glue code wouldn’t be necessary.<br/><br/>The way we cut systems into smaller manageable pieces today — often using taxonomies in the form of class or type hierarchies — is directly connected to this. This is why I’m super interested in how we categorize things, not just in programming, but in thinking.<br/><br/>Alluding to what <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Shalabh</span> writes in <em>Systems, not Programs</em>, we need to look at other ways to slice these systems into manageable parts.

IMO designing a "composition model" is the primary job in programming language design. Minimizing the amount of glue code you need to write when plugging components together is a major goal. Designing a type system is a big part of semantic composition. I take the same view for designing syntax: I want good syntactic composability for syntactic phrases, and I want to minimize the amount of "glue syntax" that you need to write.

The Unix shell has good syntactic composability. But the "everything is text" model requires too much parsing (glue code). As many people have observed, a more differentiated type system would eliminate a lot of the parsing glue, and provide better semantic composability.

I was taught a style of object oriented programming wherein you define a large number of classes, each with a bespoke interface. Composability was considered a code smell. According to the "Law of Demeter" (as interpreted by my instructor), objects should only talk to their immediate friends, using a private language only that object and its friends understand. The goal of this was supposed to be "information hiding" and "loose coupling", and writing tons of glue code and boilerplate was how you achieved these important goals. Maybe other people can offer a different perspective on OOP, but I don't like this style of programming, and I prefer functional style programming, which focuses more on composability.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Doug Moen</span> Yes! Lots of truth in your comments. The post-Kay re-interpretation of OOP certainly was somewhat misguided, even though with good intentions — it is very natural to try to mirror an objective reality in a system and employing the same structure we thought we’d naturally use in our heads.<br/><br/>Designing a composition model might be one of the most important aspects of designing a programming language, however, I think it’s worth to note that at that point, once you decided to design a programming language, you have already made a lot of assumptions and entered a context that makes the bigger picture harder to see and you might overlook other ways to compose systems, outside the language context.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Zubair Quraishi</span> Welcome to Future of Coding, the club for Architecture Astronauts. I'm serious: we have ambitious goals for the future of coding, and to reach these goals, we need to be able to see the big picture, which can only be seen from orbit. Some of us use mathematical tools, abstract algebra and category theory (monoids and monads) to help us see the big picture. Of course, we don't want to stay in orbit permanently: at some point you must leave the design phase, touch ground and write useful code. And many people in our community are doing that.

Many past systems were like this, so I can point to earlier systems in order to show that this is feasible.<br/><br/>For example, the original Unix system (before Macintosh-style GUIs were added) was a programming language. The user interface was the shell, which is a programming language. Every shell command is a program written in the shell language. Abstract mechanisms like variables, functions, conditionals and loops are right at hand. The Unix file system is the global namespace for this programming language. Want to do some word processing? Troff is a programming language, and a word processing document is a program written in that language. With Unix, you booted right into an IDE, and you stayed in that IDE the whole time you were using the computer. Of course 1970's Unix was difficult to use by modern standards, but that's not the point. The point is that Unix mimiced the user interfaces of early systems, and extended those interfaces into programming languages without making them harder to use. The Unix shell looked a lot like earlier and more primitive command line interfaces that weren't fully programmable. Troff was just runoff extended to be fully programmable.

Yes, programming languages do design the composition methods inside of them. I came to respond to that but <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> already said it much better so I'll just quote it<br/>&gt; it’s worth to note that at that point, once you decided to design a programming language, you have already made a lot of assumptions and entered a context that makes the bigger picture harder to see and you might overlook other ways to compose systems, outside the language context.<br/>Yes, yes! One connotation of the 'language context' is that we write programs in full, and then run them, but the composition of two running programs is not usually considered a 'program'.<br/>&gt; my plans for the future of coding involve expanding the definition of "programming language" to encompass the entire system<br/>Sounds very interesting. At this point is it worth calling it a programming language? We don't usually call Excel a programming language. And when we talk of Smalltalk as a programming language that fits on a postcard, I think it misses a key aspect of programming Smalltalk in that you're not writing then running programs in batch mode, but rather crafting the system very differently by tweaking parts of it live. It's kind of like the Unix shell in some sense?

I found myself rereading an older thread (<a href="../thinking-together/1568748321.207400.html">../thinking-together/1568748321.207400.html</a>). In particular, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span>'s paper on reusable vs re-editable code seems very relevant: <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01966146/document">https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01966146/document</a>

Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> for making Slack notify me of this thread that I have somehow missed! It's a topic I have been thinking about for a long time, ending up writing a blog post (<a href="https://blog.khinsen.net/posts/2016/03/04/composition-is-the-root-of-all-evil/">https://blog.khinsen.net/posts/2016/03/04/composition-is-the-root-of-all-evil/</a>) and an article (<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02117720">https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02117720</a>) on it (plus the one already cited).<br/><br/>Many aspects of the problem have already been mentioned here, so let me add just the one I feel missing: there is insufficient incentive in computing to make people agree on interfaces (APIs, data formats, programming languages, ...). In the physical world, a machine shop is free to define and make their own screws, but there is a high cost associated with deviating from industry standards, because important economies of scale are lost. In the world of bits, there are few such economies, making it cheap to introduce different interfaces (neither better nor worse, just different) for strategic or ideological reasons.<br/>The rise of a few big players has aggravated that problem, leading to the information silos and walled gardens we have today. In parallel, we hardly see standardization efforts any more - all the major standards in computing are more than 20 years old. Standards happen in markets where no player can hope to achieve dominance but everyone has a shared interest in growth of the market as a whole.<br/>Now add Conway's law (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law</a>) and you see the link between this situation and the increasing concentration of power/capital in the economy in general. Which raises the question of what kind of organization could favor more composability in computing.

Excellent stuff, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span>! (I think I'd only seen one of these papers earlier.) The blog post is :100:. I share the perspective of the broader (English?) meaning composition. Really when I want to combine virtual object A (file) and virtual object B (program) I want them to compose at the 'highest level of meaning' represented by these object, but the bit formats and other intermediate languages are always 'in the way'.
