No, because I'll just end up talking in a private sort of language that no one understands. But should I do that anyway?\n&gt; Think about the original twitter status update, how it was a still-undefined format. Lunch and what's on tv and headed out and reading X, all became the first announcements. There weren't pictures of peoples' lunches back then!\n\nI've often felt this same thing. <#CCL5VVBAN|share-your-work> and <#C0120A3L30R|two-minute-week> feel like very structured places. <#C5T9GPWFL|thinking-together> and <#C5U3SEW6A|linking-together> have their own purposes. I've often wanted a place where I can share what I'm up to or thinking about without feeling the need to meet some bar.\n\nNow maybe its best that we don't do that. Maybe it is just noise. But since someone else mentioned it, I wanted to post about it. I was thinking something along the lines of #devlog-together. Only structure I might suggest is that people should post at most 1 top-level post per day.\n\nI know something like this would encourage me to share more. Would I share every day, probably not. But it would be a place I could share things that I don't feel meet the bar of those other channels.\n\nThoughts? Good idea? Or just noise?",
