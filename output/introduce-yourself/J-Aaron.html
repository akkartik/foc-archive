Greetings!<br/><br/>Name is Aaron. I'm new to the community, introduced by a good friend. I'm the technical director at Singularity 6, a newish game studio. Prior to that I was at Riot Games for a long time and prior to that a number of non-game tech startups in the US and in China/Hong Kong. I got my start in open source contributions in the Java projects over at Apache.<br/><br/>When it comes to the future of programming, I'm particularly interested in (1) practical applications in game development, such as Unreal's blueprints and (2) future productive VR/AR desktop environments. To this day, I'm still most at home in Emacs.
