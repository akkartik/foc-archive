Code is for computers, and comments are for people (including the author who months down the road may not remember why something was done). Maybe in big companies you can slip through the cracks.

I sure hope that all the designers here make an effort in your new language to encourage people to comment their code.",

Code is for computers, and comments are for people (including the author who months down the road may not remember why something was done). Maybe in big companies you can slip through the cracks. I was also surprised that Boeing bungled the software so bad for the MCAS system, a critical system that only read one of 2 sensors, and had numerous fatal - as in killing people - mistakes in their software. I sure hope that all the designers here make an effort in your new language to encourage people to comment their code."
