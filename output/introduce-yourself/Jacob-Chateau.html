Hey there! I study math, physics, and compsci independently. My interests focus on the (shared!) foundations of math, physics, and language. I want to develop computationally-rich environments where communities can gather and transmute their collective knowledge and catalyze discovery, learning, and teaching.<br/><br/>I am also interested in programming language design. I am very interested in dependent type theory, homotopy theory, higher categories, and how these ideas will influence the future of computing on increasingly-varied material substrates. To this end, I am trying to reimagine the entire information architecture, from MOSFET microarchitecture all the way up the abstraction layers. To this end, I want to extend the idea of formal structure (especially as implemented in category theory and functional programming languages) to include "formal substance", and to leverage the understanding which this affords to make more efficient metamaterial substrates for the observation and control of information flow, generally.<br/><br/>I got into math to learn physics, and then I got into computer science when I learned that my category theory knowledge should overlap significantly with the functional programming paradigm. I am currently reading SICP and learning Scheme, taking a break from Haskell so that I can better understand compiler and interpreter design. I'd like to push high-level interpretation further down in abstraction, and to find how information flow relates fundamentally to the shapes of our programs as physical control processes.
