Hi everyone!<br/><br/>I want to make the process of coding closer to how we think about programming. I'm currently experimenting with structural/projectional code editors. I am also fascinated by how structural editors open a window for new programming languages unburdened from text-based syntax.<br/><br/>I don't have much to showcase as I was mostly investigating the field and experimenting with small prototypes in the last few months.<br/><br/>Would be glad to meet someone who's working in the same direction.
