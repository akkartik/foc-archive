Hello all! I’m new to the Future of Coding community, but I do live in NYC and am working on something someone else might be interested in talking/sketching out with me.<br/>I’m currently working on a protocol and simple Reactive Database which implements some of the designs behind Dynamicland’s RealTalk language in Rust. The basic concept is anything can make a claim about the world in the form <tt>_ is powered on</tt> (<tt>"TV:1" is powered "on"</tt>, <tt>"Toaster1" is powered "on"</tt>) or <tt>_ is near _</tt> (<tt>"TV:1" is near "Person:Steve"</tt>) and each claim can be queried on such as <tt>When /thing/ is powered on, /thing/ is near "Person:Steve": print(thing); Wish (thing) was turned ("off")</tt> which with this fact base would result in wishing that <tt>TV:1</tt> was powered off.
