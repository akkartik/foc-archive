Aloha everyone. I'm Breck, a researcher at the UH Cancer Center Honolulu. My main communities these days are HN, Lobsters, /r/programminglanguages/, and SUS. I work on Tree Notation and am creating the Tree Notation Lab here. Our theory is there is a natural notation sitting between binary notation and higher level languages that has been overlooked and it could be a silver bullet. We call it Tree Notation and it's very promising (though we might have some details wrong---always looking for help). To be thorough, we build the largest database of programming and computer languages in the world with over 10K languages and over 1K columns (in the process of open sourcing it!). The first key applications we are working on is for a new data science language and studio for cancer/bioinformatics researchers, and a new grammar for electronic medical records. We are also helping over 30 companies now experiment with new languages in domains from tax returns to logic languages to visual ides and new languages for deep learning. DC referred me to this community and it looks very cool! I have never gotten into the Slack habit, so I apologize for noob mistakes.
