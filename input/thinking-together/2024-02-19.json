What would you choose?\n\nThe basic intuition here is how two people cut a cake fairly. One cuts, the other chooses. The person cutting has an incentive to make the division as equal as possible.\n\nHowever, our question has many more dimensions, and it's hard to even imagine what \"equal\" looks like.\n\nRawls's answer:\n• For attributes that seem fairly localized and intrinsic, give everybody the exact same degrees of freedom. This is the conventional idea of \"basic liberties\", e.g. through space (e.g. no chains) and time (e.g. no killing)\n• Give everybody as much of that basic freedom as possible -- as long as it's exactly equal.\n• Beyond the intrinsics, we don't know how to even list the infinite ways the self can interact with the environment to create happiness. Making everything identical loses a lot of collective generativity. So instead smear out the probability of various dimensions you can think of randomly across society. Each dimension is not uniformly distributed, but the dimensions are uncorrelated.\n• In spite of our best efforts things won't be \"fair\". Some people will have better luck simply because there are too many dimensions and we can't even perceive them all. Try to compensate the unlucky with \"money\".\n• Now let everyone loose to play the usual competitions for social standing that humans seem wired to engage in.\nThis is only an idealized thought experiment. When tempted to extrapolate from it to the real world, bear in mind at least these two limitations of it:\n• Everyone isn't born at the same time. There's no guidance here on how to achieve fairness across many generations.\n• We have many countries and no real way to coordinate across them. Any attempt at enforcing fairness within a country must deal with the opportunities for people to exit to other countries.\nUnrelated to Rawls, the most interesting idea in the podcast for me was something Lea Ypi said: that an axiom of Marx was to value the aggregate of Labor equally with the aggregate of Capital. I've been noodling on this for a while. For example, I wonder about a law that requires any new corporation to place 50% of equity with employees at all times. As a concrete example, you'd put everyone who invested on one side, everybody granted vesting stock options on another side. Put 50% of the equity on either side, to share on a _pro rata_ basis. It would make stock trading a little more complex, because x% of the company might turn into y% after a sale across the divide.\n\nI think we might need a third equal category for customers :thinking_face: I don't know what _pro rata_ would mean there..",
