Friendly reminder â€” when posting a link, please include some additional text as context. Preferably, explain what interests you about the link, or at the very least include a pull quote that gives us a sense of what the link is about.<br/><br/>Don't rely on the Slack-generated preview card, as those <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/member-handbook#link-previews">will be removed</a> in most cases. (I won't remove the preview if it is a video, so that people can watch the video right here without leaving Slack. I will remove the preview if is just the title of the page and an uninformative image, as is typical with news articles, Github links, etc.) The reason for the removal is that these preview cards are generally much less helpful than whatever context and/or pull quote you'll provide when sharing the link, and they eat a lot of scroll height, meaning the signal-to-noise is low. They are also a Slack-specific feature added to the <em>display</em> of your message separate from the actual <em>content</em> of your message, reducing the portability of your message to other platforms (eg: Mariano's history tool, the newsletter, etc).

I skipped the context when there was a preview card (a behavior that went against me when making the newsletter :smile:)<br/><br/>I will include the context from now on :slightly_smiling_face:
