I'll be visiting Berlin from Wed 26th June to Sat 29th, and I was wondering if anyone would be interested in grabbing a beer or going for a lunch or something? Could chat about topics like design tools and AI, creative coding, automated design tools, for example. Also interested in any suggestions on what to do or see!<br/><br/>The generative art summit looked great, but unfortunately it is first on the week after (<a href="https://art-meets-science.io/en/generative-art-summit-berlin/">https://art-meets-science.io/en/generative-art-summit-berlin/</a>), same for the creative code meetup (<a href="https://www.meetup.com/creativecodeberlin/">https://www.meetup.com/creativecodeberlin/</a>).
