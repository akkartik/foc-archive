I want a solid, intuitive (google maps-like) rendering and interaction to build off of. I mainly program in and prefer web technologies. But if there is something like panzoom for python or java or something, I'll do that instead. Does anyone have any recommendations? panzoom is the closest library I've found that is generic enough and flexible enough to do what I want, but I'm running into bizarre problems with it that I just don't want to deal with.
