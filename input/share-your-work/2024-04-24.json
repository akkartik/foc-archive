But even for \"classical\" simulations, it's not reasonable to aim for realistic volumes. A small drop of water, say 0.05 ml, has 10^{21} water molecules. Most properties of water for which the molecular scale matters can be computed with 1000 molecules on a hypertorus. And if you are interested in the specificities of the droplet, for things like surface tension, a continuum mechanics simulation (fluid dynamics, as used for engineering) is both cheaper and provides more insight.",
