Hi! I'm Padraig, I'm based in London and mostly work on the frontend (although I'm increasingly keen to get deeper than that...) I don't fully understand what this place is yet but I like the vibes. My interests tend to swing heavily retro gimmick stuff (e.g. I could probably write a blog about children's watches in old Argos catalogs and how they perfectly represent the technologies of the period) so it's debatable how much I can contribute to the future...<br/><br/>My attempts to make positive contributions towards the software dev ecosystem are generally a mix of (in order of importance):<br/>1. making sure websites I work on still work on my mam's phone<br/>2. pushing back in my workplaces against Google Analytics being dumped into absolutely everything everywhere<br/>3. posting literally anything possibly useful I discover about a thing in a public location so others can find it in the future (tbh I think this is arguably the most important one these days...)<br/>4. reviving old abandoned tech either via software (e.g. most recently I reverse engineered an ewaste STEM toy and made a library for it <a href="https://github.com/padraigfl/twsu-arcade-coder-esp32">https://github.com/padraigfl/twsu-arcade-coder-esp32</a> , previously I wrote some tools and documentation to help preservation efforts for the abandonware mixed media card game Dropmix) or just finding personal uses for them (e.g. the FM radio station of rain sounds I've in my flat so our dog can't hear the foxes our neighbour keeps feeding)<br/>5. dumb half-finished proof of concept stuff like my recreation of the Shrek DVD menu (<a href="https://github.com/padraigfl/dvd-menu">https://github.com/padraigfl/dvd-menu</a>)<br/>Most my social network are extremely non-technical people so it'd be great to get involved in some things with people who know what I'm talking about when I talk about these things (or can tell when I don't know what I'm talking about and call me out!). Should be at the meetup this Friday, not totally sure what to expect but I'm looking forward to it!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.pdrgf.com/about">www.pdrgf.com/about</a>
