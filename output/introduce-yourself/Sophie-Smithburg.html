(technically i think i did the introduction already but, it's been <b>ages</b> so)<br/><br/>hi i'm sophie! into SRE/PLT stuff and the intersection thereof. also complexity studies (SFI WOOOOOOO) and integrating social concerns into tech work. details follow:<br/>• i'm doing some research on my own for how to improve language tooling radically. currently trying to hook interpreters to infer approximate formal semantics using symbolic execution techniques and some other stuff. starting with ruby and rubyspec/mri for now.<br/>• deeply into making computing more humane and ethical<br/>• think full time employment isn't a safe or ethical engagement structure for most techies<br/>• interested in moving to consulting/research/products that are radically focused on making the above point re making computing more humane and ethical; open to inquiries if that's ever of interest to anyone<br/>• very open to talking about my work and sharing/learning from others
