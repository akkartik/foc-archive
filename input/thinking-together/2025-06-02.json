There are so many different ways to approach this, all with tradeoffs that I personally don't have time to evaluate (for now). So the very first problem to be solved is social: who is available to work on this problem, and when? Also, choosing something like AT Proto or ActivityPub or Gemini or similar alternative\/variant is downstream of design questions like \"what are our cultural values?\" and \"how do we want to be empowered?\". So yours is a fine question, I'm just ill-positioned to answer it right now. &lt;3",

There are so many different ways to approach this, all with tradeoffs that I personally don't have time to evaluate (for now). So the very first problem to be solved is social: who is available to work on this problem, and when? Also, choosing something like AT Proto or ActivityPub or Gemini or similar alternative\/variant is downstream of design questions like \"what are our cultural values?\" and \"how do we want to be empowered?\". So yours is a fine question, I'm just ill-positioned to answer it right now. <3"
