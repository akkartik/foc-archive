I should probably write to Sourcegraph about his but listening to the podcast here was how my thought process went for me<br/><br/>PC: Sourcegraph tells you stuff<br/>Me: Hmm, My IDE already does that<br/>PC: We use plugins<br/>Me: VSCode already does that and lots of editors are adding support. So?<br/>PC: We scanned all of github<br/>Me: K, sounds a little useful but like Steve said searching on github sucks, why is yours better<br/>PC: We can scan your entire company's projects so you can find usage and code<br/>Me: Okay, that might be useful if I worked at a company but at the moment I'm a one man band<br/>PC: There's a plugin for github with 27k repos scanned already<br/>Me: Hmm, I'll at least check that out.<br/><br/>Man, I'm not doing a good job of explaining how my thoughts went. I don't remember where or why I switched from sceptical to interest peaked but I did. BUT.....<br/><br/>Then I went to spread the love. I go paste links to their site and their chrome extension in another slack. I'm met with the same scepticism and I have zero ideas about how to convey anything that would get the other devs to even look. I go on the Sourcegraph site, nothing. I search for Sourcegraph vs IDEs, there's one about vs IntelliJ from stackshare. In that Intelli-j trounces sourcegraph (it's a popularity contest though)<br/><br/>The idea of write once use everywhere is appealing to the engineer in me but I only use a couple of editors in every day use.<br/><br/>They really need a "why sourcegraph is better than your IDE" page with concrete examples of where sourcegraph did something I actually need to do. When I was on the chromium team their code search (<a href="https://cs.chromium.org/">https://cs.chromium.org/</a>) was super useful but I'm not working on anything that big at the moment.<br/><br/>So, "why sourcegraph is better than my IDE?"<br/><br/>and, for the browser plugin, what are some concrete examples of things I would actually do with it?

Good questions - I agree Quinn would love to hear your thought process. My guess is that he would say it's not a competition necessarily - sourcegraph is hoping to augment your IDE with code intelligence (via language servers so sometimes no need to install sourcegraph) or via the chrome extension if you want code intelligence on github or via code search (of which theirs is a lot better than most IDEs I'd imagine)

Quinn definitely was sell Sourcegraph's virtue as being in all the places.  I want to try it out, but man his heart is in the right place: make a tool that gives you the stuff that you'll actually use all the time.

At a small company I find myself using more open source code than at a large company. Docs are not always complete. In sourcegraph I can right click on a library function and “find all references” to it across all of GitHub to see examples of how to use it. Really helps in closing the gap!

At a large company this problem is often solved by a mono-repo where all usages of that library live. Much easier to discover.<br/><br/>So I would argue sourcegraph is <em>more</em> useful to small companies/teams.

Cool episode <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span>, do you have the link to the contract work to write plugins for sourcegraph that Quinn mentions almost at the end? Thanks!

Thanks! I wasn't able to find it. Maybe email him?
