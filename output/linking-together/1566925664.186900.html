The disconnect may be that people are talking about existing product categories rather than platonic ideals.<br/><br/>I'm not sure anyone's ever made the claim that what tiling WMs are today strictly dominates what stacking WMs <em>could be</em> in the best of all possible universes. That feels like a strawman.<br/><br/>Which is why I wish you had led with the product that improves on stacking WM state of the art. I got a lot out of this discussion, but I suspect you'd have gotten more if you'd done that. You'd have needed to repeat yourself less.<br/><br/>I'm definitely looking forward to trying out your AppleScript.
