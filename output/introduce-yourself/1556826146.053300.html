Hello everyone! PhD student in CS but have been coding for around 15 years. I've done hundreds of things as I was always "following the new trends" during all this time. As of today, I'm very into JIT compilers and WebAssembly, also my PhD is on Scientific Visualization with an application to Biology. These days I'm going through some kind of early-adult-life crisis, I had a daughter 3 years ago and that changed my perspective on life completely. I used to be a very chill person and didn't worry about "monetizing" my career. Now I have bills to pay and I want to find ways to turn my talent into profit. This has been very difficult as my network is mostly scientists and we are very disconnected from /the real world/. I've tried to join some university incubators but had no success (I could tell the story later). I'm mainly looking to network with people to either 1. get into a new venture/startup and help getting it off the ground or 2. find a nice job to go to after I finish my PhD. Don't hesitate to message me if you want to talk about pretty much anything (I read a lot about many things, not only science related). I've been reading HN (and other stuff) daily since 2009, so if you just want to talk industry gossip is cool for me. Also greetings everyone :smile:!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dan Cook</span> Some life scientists have to deal with 100s of images and look for very particular features in them. I found a way to classify and identify meaningful patterns in them and no, it is not done w/ machine learning. It is a very nice approach that involves geometry and even some tricks I learned from audio DSPs.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@nicolas decoster</span> I cannot go into detail as the novelty of what I'm doing will be gone :sweat_smile:. But in very broad terms, let's consider the 'space of images' as a high dimensional arbitrary space, turns out there is a transformation of this space (defined in abstract terms) that exposes a geometrical structure which makes this data very easy to work with, classify things, cluster them, etc... For this I had to learn differential geometry and a little bit of differential topology, so far I'm loving this new (for me) math, but I'm still a novice in these things!

I understand! But as for my interest, it is because I have an image processing background and done some (small) study on geometric side (for map data) and feature extraction. So anytime you have something public I will be glad to hear about it. Anyway, have fun! :slightly_smiling_face:

Al Mo, what kind of interest do you have in WebAssembly? I've been kind of disappointed with the garbage collection proposal and the fact that they've broken work on Wasm into several different proposals - I thought it needed to be designed more holistically, likely with the objects/GC system as a centerpiece. I've been wanting to design a low-level type system for the GC system but I figured they'd just ignore me if I proposed something, particularly since I didn't keep up with all the other developments since the Wasm MVP.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@David Piepgrass</span> I was doing the usual drill C/C++ to WebAssembly but did not want to use emscripten, so I had to learn almost everything from scratch and I now know how to set up minimal applications meant to be run on the browser. In the end I had built something like an amateur clone of emscripten haha. I agree with you that in general WebAssembly is missing a lot of cool things, would love to see it improve with the years.

What was the motivation for avoiding emscripten? Me, I found it to be a pretty crufty, annoying tool that produces bloated output... did you write about your experience or have you seen a well-written post about using Wasm without emscripten?

The motivation was that I was writing very simple programs, i.e. some pure functions with no dependencies. So the only thing I plugged in are pretty much a malloc and some strncpy/strlen equivalents. Dropping emscripten for that kind of thing was overkill, also I always want to learn how things work from scratch. I generally dislike "frameworks" built on top of other things (jQuery, express, you name it).

I have a very dogmatic approach to software development where I want to keep things minimal and with a "bootstrap yourself" attitude. Of course it's (only a bit) more painful but you actually understand the nuts and bolts of everything and that gives you some kind of "magic" instinct when you are solving problems with that particular tool.

Side note: which ironically has prevented me from landing some jobs as they want the guy that works with the framework. I tell them, I can learn your framework in one afternoon since it was built on the actual things that I understand 100%. But the answer is usually "yeah no". Then they go hire the guy who is an "expert" with laravel (or django, or &lt;whatever_tool&gt; bla bla) but spends their time on stackoverflow asking things like "What is a network port?"

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@David Piepgrass</span> But back to your other question &gt;"have you seen a well-written post about using Wasm without emscripten?" Actually it was a pain in the ass to actually figure out what you should do and what you shouldn't. There's like 5 or 6 posts around the net with instructions but not one of them actually works good. There is even one gist with step by step instructions that doesn't work at all if you follow them, because of some wrong syntax when calling clang. That thing should had never worked for anyone yet the gist is full of "thanks!" "this is great" comments from other developers from an alternate universe where clang actually works with these made up parameters :^). But (again) good knowledge of the C standard and compilers (clang, GCC) helped me a lot,since the tricky part (for me) was compiling the actual .wasm without linking and keeping only the functions I wanted.

"I have a very dogmatic approach ... keep things minimal ... bootstrap yourself"<br/><br/>Sounds like a good fit for this community!<br/><br/>Have you explored (or are you interested in) anything along the lines of bootstrapping your own approach to software?<br/><br/>For example, I'm exploring an approach wherein the program being created, the process for building that program from source "code" (e.g. the "language" and "compiler"), and the UI for viewing and editing all of these things, ... is all defined within a single self-contained tool, capable of editing/molding it itself (or its contents) on the fly. The idea is that you program using whatever language (or other representation/visualization), tools, and process you like.

The most related thing I've done is figuring out how to compile C code on the fly and loading it at runtime (using Bellard's TCC and again only simple and pure functions). What you suggest is pretty cool in the way that it sounds like it would allow for this kind of thing to be implemented effortlessly. I would love to take a look at it when it's ready :smile:.
