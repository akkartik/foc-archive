Hey <span style="background-color:#ccf">@David Broderick</span>, inspired after attending <a href="http://recurse.com/">http://recurse.com/</a>, I’ve been trying to bring a similar concept to life for two years now — much smaller in scope and objective, but not shy of a similar vision. We managed to do a super-small but insightful prototype event in Hamburg, then an exceptionally well-planned “minimum viable experience” in Berlin (<a href="https://www.eventbrite.de/e/levelup-sprint-ios-development-registration-46756773769?ref=eios">https://www.eventbrite.de/e/levelup-sprint-ios-development-r&hellip;</a>) which turned out to not happen. As a result of that we changed direction slightly (I guess it’s called “pivot”), dropped the plan to turn this into a business, and had a successful event in Budapest with 10 attendees in November last year. And now we’re planning to iterate on that with an upcoming event near Helsinki in July.<br/><br/>At this point I can say that we know how to run a good event, yet we still have no idea how to turn this into a viable business. It’s mostly a labor of love and passion at the moment, “paid” only by the positive change attendees leave the weekend with and the strong feeling of connection we can create in a small group after just three days.<br/><br/>In these last three years my perspective went from “Ah, I can build a better Recurse Center / recreate something like Dynamicland in Europe” to “Hmm, that’s why they decided to do things that way” to “Fuck, this is really, really difficult!”<br/><br/>I sincerely hope you have a good idea of what you’re getting into and am happy to share the things I learned along the way. I would love to see more places like this to exist around the world, where good people with good ideas can work on the future. But there are reasons for why not many places like this exist, and why the ones that do are struggling.
