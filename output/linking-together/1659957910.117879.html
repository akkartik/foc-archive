I played on prototype #3 at the berlin tools for thought meetup. Very cool and interesting, although quite hard to see how authoring a markdown document from scratch is really possible in AR at this time. I think we are all hoping for the next headset to emphasize pass-through better. You can definitely see potential though! Was a great demo it had cogs in my head turning for weeks.

Yeah, I went through a demo with him and discussed the data model and visualization style while he was working on this version. It's definitely much more interesting for viewing content than creating it at the moment. :+1::skin-tone-2:

Good fun.  Good, good fun.  My VR rule is to steer clear of text.  Always asking how I can use spacial/material features in place of words.  When I do need labels, I like to manifest them as an overlay pointing to related objects but positioned a meter or ten away pointing directly at you.  Seems easier to read.  (You can do a weird rendering trick where the objects fade out when you look at a label behind them.  That sometimes works great and sometimes breaks your brain, not sure what exactly makes the difference.)   And can we please avoid mounting text on handheld objects.  Every time I see wrist mounted skeuomorphism in VR, I die a little.  The whole damn point is that I don't have to use my hands for things to be handy!
