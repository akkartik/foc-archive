I've programmed most of my life, and since I've mentored many programmers, I've seen first-hand how bewildering and overly complex modern programming can be. My main focus right now is learning anything and everything that can help me contribute towards a better future for programming.\n\nRight now, I'm working on the Peony game engine, a 3D game engine written from scratch in C++: <https:\/\/vladh.net\/peony>\n\nYou can read some of my thoughts on programming here: <https:\/\/vladh.net\/manifesto>\n\nLastly, I'd be extremely happy to chat with more like-minded people, so I'm looking forward to talking to you guys. If you find what I'm doing even mildly interesting, feel free to DM me, I'm always open for a chat.",
