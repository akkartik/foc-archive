&gt; I was stunned that I could be playing with PageMaker and doing work -- laying my galleys, stuff I'd done in the real world with real objects -- and when I went home at night and remembered what I'd done that day, I remembered working with my hands. I didn't have this image in my head of this digital text block being moved by a cursor. In my mind, I was grabbing galleys and sticking wax on them and laying them down. To me, working with a good interface is working with my hands.<br/>&gt; <br/><a href="https://craphound.com/nonfic/mackerel.html">https://craphound.com/nonfic/mackerel.html</a>

&gt; Kevin, someone who doesn’t think of himself as a computer guy, somehow ended up the in-house sage on matters digital. Periodically, the boys would ask him, “What is this icon on the desktop, HyperCard?” To which he would always answer, “That is a black hole from which we will never return.”

Intrigued, I found the original Mackerel Stack at <a href="https://archive.org/details/hypercard_the-mackerel-stack-154">https://archive.org/details/hypercard_the-mackerel-stack-154</a> and loaded it up in HyperCard running on <a href="https://macos8.app/">https://macos8.app/</a>. The stack is filled with long transitions composed of dithering effects, inversion, random sound effects, but the real treat is this TV dinner that I am stuck on. I also found a HyperCard memoir by the subject of both of those quotes, of course with it's own stylistic flair.<br/><a href="http://www.kevinsteele.com/smackerel/black_white_00.html">http://www.kevinsteele.com/smackerel/black_white_00.html</a>
