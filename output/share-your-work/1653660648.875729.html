Hey folks, I wanna show you  something new we have been working on - an <b>AI code review bot</b> :robot_face:. Most pull requests (about 2/3) get merged without corrections, and the idea is to have the bot detect and approve them. This was born out frustration constantly waiting for 'code review' for small and safe code contribution, especially since I believe in "ship small &amp; often. Also it allows you to focus on the trickier changes instead.<br/><br/>:point_right: Here's how it works: anybody can do a 'historical' test on any repository here - <a href="https://codeball.ai/">https://codeball.ai/</a> to test out the accuracy. To do reviews on new pull requests, it's setup as a GitHub action.<br/>I'd love to hear what you smart people think! Happy to also share more about the model too (basically it's a neural net, the inputs include features about the code, the author and author experience with the code changed, trained on over 1M code contributions).

Interesting concept. It looked very accurate in the example I checked.<br/><br/>Have you given any thought to liability, i.e. Codeball automatically merges a PR that goes on to do damage, be it physical and/or economic? I assume you'd have to be super clear on how to define your terms of service and make sure that your company insurance is fully up to par.
