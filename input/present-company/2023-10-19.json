Hopefully I will have time to get around to them again. And if I do get time but have lost interest, cool, I will at that point already be a person who is not interested in them and I can make that ok.\n\nOn the other hand I've found a few pockets of hours of free time here and there, and I tend to just do whatever seems right at that moment. If it means rest, then rest. But one time I did 4 hours of painting on a whim even though I've only painted like 2 things in my adult life, and it rocked and I'm proud of it despite painting not being near my 'life goals.'\n\nMaybe paradoxically my advice is don't invest too much expectation into the time you do get. Try to stay spontaneous wherever you can. Try to bias toward doing the thing you actually want to do at the moment, not always working toward some future achievements.
