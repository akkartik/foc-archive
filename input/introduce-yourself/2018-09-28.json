Like many of you, I'm a gentleman scientist (<https:\/\/nadiaeghbal.com\/independent-research>), tinkering with language ideas that I'd love to use with real work -- like Automatic Concurrency, Automatic Mutable State Safety, Safe Hot Swap, Automatic Garbage Collection, and Friendly Dependent Types. I'm based in Denver in case anyone else is here. I find myself in Boston, SF (recently for YC events), and NYC now and then too, and love to talk PLs. Nice to be here.",
