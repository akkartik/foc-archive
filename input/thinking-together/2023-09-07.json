I'm starting to realize there's a thorny pre-problem in this discussion of even separating two ideas in my mind using the imprecise tool of language. Or at least my imperfect wielding of language.\n\nAs I continue to poke at this, it seems worth leaving this quote from <http:\/\/akkartik.name\/illich.pdf> (italicization identical to original):\n\n&gt; After many doubts, and against the advice of friends whom I respect, _I have chosen \"convivial\" as a technical term to designate a modern society of responsibly limited tools._ In part this choice was conditioned by the desire to continue a discourse which had started with its Spanish cognate. The French cognate has been given technical meaning (for the kitchen) by Brillat−Savarin in his _Physiology of Taste: Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy_. This specialized use of the term in French might explain why it has already proven effective in the unmistakably different and equally specialized context in which it will appear in this essay. I am aware that in English \"convivial\" now seeks the company of tipsy jollyness, which is distinct from that indicated by the OED and opposite to the austere meaning of modern _\"eutrapelia,\"_ which I intend. By applying the term \"convivial\" to tools rather than to people, I hope to forestall confusion.",
