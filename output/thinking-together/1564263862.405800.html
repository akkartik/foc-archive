Personally, there's so much I'd like to do but can't, being tied to a full time job and a family of my own (wouldn't trade them for anything, but my point is I just don't have the time and resources). But even among all other PhD students who are essentially focusing all their time in similar work (and lucky enough to stumble upon realizing the potential future that software has yet to live up to) ... even among others in similar pursuit and the time and resources to do it, it seems that Steve has found himself in a very unique &amp; privileged position.<br/><br/>Now I'm not suggesting betting on any one person on being the one guy to invent TheSolution(tm), but if we were to select one person to invest in who is at a unique position to influence and to be taking in (and hopefully incorporating) more influence and connections than most in his efforts and the also in his influence to others ... I'd say Steve is the guy.
