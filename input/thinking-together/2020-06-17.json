The UI, instead of only showing you just the final form, also lets you simultaneously display intermediate forms and alternate designs, which is great. Hiding the code and showing the sketches also seems like the right choice.\n\nHow well does the Loglo UI succeed at the task for which it is designed? (Part of) the essence of spreadsheet's success is duplicating the best features of an already existing paper technology. To judge Loglo, I would look at artist sketchbooks. Eg, consider this image: <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FLwp2MIuJRs> There are two intermediate forms on the left, and the final result on the right. The explanatory text beside each image is kind of like the \"code\". If you play the video, the first page of the sketchbook hides the explanations *behind* the images, which you have to open up like greeting cards. This seems like a metaphor for hiding the code behind the image until you request to see it, in a UI.\n\nVisual artists prefer to organize their ideas in 2D space (this is a lesson I learn from the extreme popularity of node+wire visual languages for graphics, relative to text languages, and from looking at sketchbooks created by visual thinkers). Requiring all of the sketches to fit into equal size cells on a regular grid seems like a limitation of Loglos. I think you'd want to organize the sketches on a 2D canvas, and allow for different intermediate forms to have different sizes, depending on their importance and internal complexity.\n\nLoglo shows you a series of intermediate forms generated by applying successive operations in a pipeline. That's valuable, but I would also want the ability to display a collection of forms generated by the same function with different parameter values.",

This seems like a metaphor for hiding the code behind the image until you request to see it, in a UI.\n\nVisual artists prefer to organize their ideas in 2D space (this is a lesson I learn from the extreme popularity of node+wire visual languages for graphics, relative to text languages, and from looking at sketchbooks created by visual thinkers). Requiring all of the sketches to fit into equal size cells on a regular grid seems like a limitation of Loglos. I think you'd want to organize the sketches on a 2D canvas, and allow for different intermediate forms to have different sizes, depending on their importance and internal complexity.\n\nLoglo shows you a series of intermediate forms generated by applying successive operations in a pipeline. That's valuable, but I would also want the ability to display a collection of forms generated by the same function with different parameter values."
