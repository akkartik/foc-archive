Hi community! My name is Pere and I'm a PM, ex strategy consultant and robotics researcher. I have been helping people build products and digitize processes for the last 5 years, and eventually came to the conclusion that there ought to be a better way. Recently, I automated one of my data analysis task in python and was greatly surprised at how ridiculously complex it it was to automate something I "programmed" in excel in under 10 minutes. This made me realize the potential is much bigger than what I thought.<br/><br/>Currently I'm exploring ways to enter the space in form of a startup. Really interested into talking to anyone thinking about entering the space, particularly if based in Spain or Greece.
