Hello all, I’m a YC founder and serial entrepreneur. My prior 3 companies have all had something to do with the future of work in general, so I’ve taken those learnings over the last 20+ years and tried to apply it to improving developer collaboration with my latest startup. I’m also a hobbyist woodworker and recently completed a two-story treehouse in our back yard with the help of my family; mostly my wife and now-16-year-old son.
