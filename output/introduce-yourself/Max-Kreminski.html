Hi all! I’m a Computational Media PhD student at the Expressive Intelligence Studio at UC Santa Cruz, working on approachable and playful mixed-initiative (AI+human creative collaboration) tools to augment human creativity. Like a lot of you, Bret Victor’s work was probably the main thing that got me into future-of-programming stuff, but I’m also inspired by games like Spore that place the process of creating stuff at the center of the play experience. More recently I’ve been thinking a lot about the problem of how to empower people to shape their digital social environments to suit their personal and community-specific needs.<br/><br/>I’m nominally an “AI researcher”, but I think the approaches to AI that are currently in vogue make a critical mistake: they focus way too much on <em>guessing</em> what people want rather than <em>asking</em> them what they want (and giving them the languages they need to answer properly). As a result, all of the AI problems I’m interested in end up also being HCI and/or PL problems to some extent, and my work keeps overlapping with future-of-programming stuff in interesting ways.<br/><br/>Some of you probably recognize me from Twitter; I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkreminski">https://twitter.com/maxkreminski</a>.
