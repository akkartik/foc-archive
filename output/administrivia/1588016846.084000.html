It’s good that possibly offensive/anti-inclusive comments are constrained to a specific channel, so that they don’t offend people in the other channels while the mod is participating and addressing any concerns.<br/>Good job Ivan and I think this might be a misunderstanding after all, which can happen in communities which do have people with diverse backgrounds and cultures

Thanks. I think so too, and I bet there would have been a way for me to handle this that led to fewer people being hurt by it. Hopefully being able to reflect on it all here in #administrivia will help me learn from this so that I can do a better job keeping the tone civil.<br/><br/>There are, of course, many kinds of comment that I would not allow us to keep on-the-record in public, even as an illustrative example. But this kind of subtle, likely inadvertant sexism is something where I hope the amount we can learn from reflecting on it outweighs whatever harm there is in allowing it to exist.

I wouldn't be too hard on yourself, Ivan. This is one of those situations where sometimes it's impossible to avoid hurting <em>someone</em>. Because if you try to be more subtle you risk the behavior continuing longer.<br/><br/>All in all, the worst-case scenario here is that it accelerates your (inevitable) burn-out managing this community. I think that should be the top priority to prevent.

Oh don't worry about me — I'm feeling fine. Just trying to make the most of this situation, and be a little more transparent about how things look from my point of view.
