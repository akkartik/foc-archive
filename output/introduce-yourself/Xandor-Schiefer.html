Hi all!<br/>I'm a web applications developer. I'm really excited by the idea of bringing programming to a less technical audience, in a way that they can easily understand, whilst being based on rigorous paradigms (without making a big song and dance about that), and having their work translate down to something a professional programmer could (and would be glad to) inherit.<br/>I've been catching up on the podcast slowly but surely and it seems like this is a community that has much in common with me. Glad to be here!
