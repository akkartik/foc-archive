A lot of the communication breakdowns\/conflicts over social issues that I observe seem to happen when people who have spent a lot of time thinking\/reading\/researching deeply about those issues encounter people who have not (and who likely don’t realize that that depth exists). Like if a beginner programmer was invited (explicitly or implicitly) to weigh in on most of the discussions on here, they would be unlikely to add value to the discussion. I think there’s some assumptions that can be made about this communities makeup as far as comfort\/experience\/interest with programming ideas, and usually people know enough to know when they don’t know something. I don’t think (and this is pretty obviously demonstrable) the same can be true of peoples engagement with social issues. I don’t have a conclusion here, but I’m curious if people have ideas for how to a) make sure these topics can and do exist here, b) avoid people being excluded due to ignorance of those topics.",

The CoC is relatively new — it's the 2nd thing I did after taking over stewardship of the community at the beginning of the year (the 1st being a survey to learn about the composition of our community and what issues people would like us to address).\n\nWe had a few expansive, difficult discussions about diversity and inclusion in the first three months of the year. I think that moved the needle on the confidence that folks have here in saying \"(A) we're going to have to talk about difficult things, (B) this community is unabashedly pro-inclusion\"\n\nThe big issue we face now is that.. this focus on inclusion is relatively new. Historically, this community has not been particularly welcoming to women and North American minorities, and it's something that will likely take a while to change — but the overwhelming majority of folks here are interested in seeing that change, and it's now just a matter of letting the community run forward with these new priorities for a while, sorting out legacy habits and hopefully doing a better job retaining the underrepresented folks who find us next than we did with the ones who found us in the past."
