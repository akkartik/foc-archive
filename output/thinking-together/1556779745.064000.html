Very interesting subject and the article seems very complete! Now, I <b>must</b> find the time to read it entirely (it is quiet long). On the same subject, I found this interesting article on Causal Tree and CRDT. I have played a little bit with Causal Tree (for a talk that illustrates Rust-WebAssembly-JavaScript bindings) and found it very very interesting. It is simple and efficient. <a href="http://archagon.net/blog/2018/03/24/data-laced-with-history/">http://archagon.net/blog/2018/03/24/data-laced-with-history/</a>
