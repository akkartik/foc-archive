Like the "Turn On" folks, we had sensors to capture a performer's movement in 3D, and the graphics hardware to render them in 3D. But we were lacking a software layer to interpret the data--only in our case just because of our own lack of experience, not because no solution yet existed. <em>Projecting 3D coordinates onto a 2D plane became a way to work with 3D data without having to think about 3D graphics.</em>
