        "text": "I like it very much! Yes, this is a great lens on one of the big issues that’s causing a lot of complexity in our field.\n\nSome random thoughts:\n\n1. I’ve always wondered why the Unix command line and in particular its pipe feature is considered a good solution and what makes it so special. I don’t have a final conclusion, but I suspect the “fuzziness” of the not very clearly defined text stream interface has to do with it. Every other data format you list tries very hard to be precise in describing data structure and even types. The text stream a sort command operates on, just needs agreement on the used delimiter. When specifying function interfaces within a programming language we’re by default already in a much more precise type system (even in dynamically types languages), which prevent that level of ambiguity (and break-ability).\n2. Human language also has this fuzziness: we can describe concepts without being sure that the person we talk to has the same definitions. Surprisingly, it works more often than it doesn’t, even though the receiver has a slightly different understanding than the sender. Programming languages break as soon as there is the slightest mismatch in syntax, grammar, or data types. We design data formats like programming languages. There’s is no room for ambiguity. By design. Maybe there should be.\n3. The pipe-able Unix text stream “type” is a very loose specification of a type, and it’s kind of monoidal in nature — everything going through a filter command line program ends up as another text stream. The required structure to make piping work is minimal and doesn’t even touch on what the data in that text stream actually is. That makes it extremely generic and composable. The parameters and return values in function calls are very specific and usually mix strict expectations on both structure and data type\/format. By that we’re creating countless different API calls that are all not easily composable.\n4. #3 is also a not yet well expressed reason why functional\/declarative is superior to imperative. Imperative code composes function calls over time (when to call what), and creates these huge, complex hierarchies and if you add concurrency to the mix it blows up even more. Other types of composition in imperative languages require additional structure in form of higher-level constructs like interfaces or design patterns. Pure functional composition and algebraic data structures allow a monoidal composition where you stay in the same category — you compose lots of things but yet they all stay the same type, just like piping on the Unix command line. There is some objective superiority in the functional or declarative approach (not sure yet which one exactly, although it could be both for different reasons) over imperative — by that I mean it can be objectively described and explained and it isn’t just a “depends on the context” issue. Unfortunately, I don’t know how to explain that yet. But the way composition works in these approaches is key. Imperative still has its value, but likely as an implementation detail between a functional\/declarative high-level language and its low-level implementation on a machine. I know that’s controversial. Please @ me! :-)\n\nI have lots more to say about this, but that’s already a lot to read so I leave it at that for now.\n\nI’ve been thinking about this for a while, but more focused on data formats and structuring data and trying to stay away from the typical programming issues like interoperability for now. I came to believe that a lot of the issues we’re trying to solve are self-made and we need to break out of our own context to find better solutions.",

I don’t have a final conclusion, but I suspect the “fuzziness” of the not very clearly defined text stream interface has to do with it. Every other data format you list tries very hard to be precise in describing data structure and even types. The text stream a sort command operates on, just needs agreement on the used delimiter. When specifying function interfaces within a programming language we’re by default already in a much more precise type system (even in dynamically types languages), which prevent that level of ambiguity (and break-ability)."

The required structure to make piping work is minimal and doesn’t even touch on what the data in that text stream actually is. That makes it extremely generic and composable. The parameters and return values in function calls are very specific and usually mix strict expectations on both structure and data type\/format.

Imperative code composes function calls over time (when to call what), and creates these huge, complex hierarchies and if you add concurrency to the mix it blows up even more. Other types of composition in imperative languages require additional structure in form of higher-level constructs like interfaces or design patterns. Pure functional composition and algebraic data structures allow a monoidal composition where you stay in the same category — you compose lots of things but yet they all stay the same type, just like piping on the Unix command line. There is some objective superiority in the functional or declarative approach (not sure yet which one exactly, although it could be both for different reasons) over imperative — by that I mean it can be objectively described and explained and it isn’t just a “depends on the context” issue. Unfortunately, I don’t know how to explain that yet. But the way composition works in these approaches is key. Imperative still has its value, but likely as an implementation detail between a functional\/declarative high-level language and its low-level implementation on a machine. I know that’s controversial. Please @ me! :-)"
