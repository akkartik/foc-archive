I added the missing ability to upload File Attachments into the HTML bundle thing (this also adds the ability to add local files to Observable notebooks as its all userspace).<br/>I am somewhat at a fork in the road about what to do about state. I prototype a cell mutating itself, and now I also have the ability to programmatically write binary blobs into itself.  IndexDB is not so relevant here because every time you fork, you lose that kind of browser state as the domain switches).<br/>So should I use cells to store state? they are cool because they are reactive and programmable, or do I use files to store state? Files are a bit more classic, maybe a bit easier to eject and upload into a different notebook. I think I lean towards files as the long term data store, seems like it would be easier to interop with other systems.

+1 to files as storage, easier to reason about statefulness in a pipeline of files than a dataflow of cells
