Interesting; so you’re basically asking users to pay in labor in exchange for a “we won’t break you” promise + other goodies

Basically, I'm starting to realize that there's an infinite number of ways to break me that I can never anticipate in advance. Using software from an independent vendor who can push arbitrary updates to your device is increasingly like making a deal with a demon who's parsing the language of your agreements in the most antagonistic way possible.<br/><br/>So no, it's not a promise not to break you. I independently think breaking compatibility is often a <em>good</em> thing for all parties that we don't explore enough. What it is is an offering of <em>ongoing control</em> in exchange for a clear line of communications.<br/><br/>The metaphor you use matters a lot here. This isn't about division of labor in a factory. This is about being allies in a war.
