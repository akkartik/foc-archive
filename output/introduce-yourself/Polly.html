Hi I'm Polly. I care about security and other things. I've done a lot of hacking the past 5 years, a lot of cryptography but also webs security, binary exploitation and whatnot. Almost all of it was in the context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)">CTFs</a>. Back when I was a kid I learnt programming through creative coding, where I wrote a lot of games and simulations and nonsense programs. I have a <a href="https://blog.polly.computer">website</a> with very little on it.<br/><br/>Lately I've been very interested in thinking about building secure software. It's kinda the problem that my field is unable to solve, or even really think about. I really like Rust because it made a good push towards that.<br/>I got very sucked into a bunch of the blog posts on <a href="http://todepond.com">todepond.com</a> after re-discovering Lu's mastodon, and have since binged some of the future of coding stuff and read/watched <em>so</em> many of the cited works.
