I obtain an OpenGL context from the operating system's window manager (Linux, MacOS, Windows), and render my scene to the GPU frame buffer associated with that context. All desktop operating systems now use compositing window managers that allow clients to render graphics into GPU framebuffers. These buffers are then composited within the GPU by the window manager.

All pixel data stays in the GPU.\n\nSo, I hope that GT has or will have the same architecture. I can ask GT for an OpenGL context, then render animated graphics into that context in a loop that runs 60 times per second within my code, and my GPU framebuffer is composited with other framebuffers within the GPU to construct the image that appears in a Pharo window.
