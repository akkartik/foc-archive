Has anyone read the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/10238">Tao of Physics</a>? How did you find it? I'm picked it up last week before a long train ride -- really not sure what to make of it yet

I read it many years ago. As a physicist and Tai-Chi practitioner, I can confirm pretty much everything it says about physics and taoism. The analogies are well observed - what you make of them is up to you of course.<br/><br/>I had a math professor at university who held a lecture every year drawing similar analogies between the creation story of the bible and the scientific story of the formation of the Earth and its biosphere. He observed in particular that the order of appearance of everything was the same.<br/><br/>Personally I find Capra's analogies more interesting than those of my math professor, but then, that's mostly a matter of personal appreciation.

As an ex-physicist taijiquan practicioner, I will offer a different perspective:<br/><br/>Someone who comes to <em>Dao of Physics</em> with a background in physics, epistemology of science, and Daoism will understand exactly what Capra means, but find nothing new, whereas those who read it <em>without</em> that background usually internalize a bad hippy/woo interpretation of the contents.

That's a cover I haven't seen in a while.  Honestly cannot recall anything concrete though!

Thanks for the input folks. I've studied a bit of Eastern religions (very little) and a bit of Physics (also very little) both enjoyed and appreciated both thoroughly. I figured it might be worth a read to connect some dots and maybe bolster my understand of both topics
