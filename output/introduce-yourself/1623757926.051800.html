:wave: Hey folks! A friend pointed me towards this community a few months ago and I've been lurking since! Have slowly been making my way through some of the content (Whole Code Catalog and related) and still can't believe how much amazing stuff you all have gathered here. SO cool that this community exists! :sparkles:<br/><br/>Similarly to what I've seen in a couple of other introductions, I got hooked on the vision of a much better future after watching Inventing on Principle by Bret Victor. Spent some time investigating the space of "mobile apps for software engineers" for my bachelor thesis. Then worked at GitHub for a couple of years, mostly on and around the GitHub platform/API. Left that job to focus full time on building the <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Simple Poll</span> Slack app (which remains my primary income source but has little to do with the future of coding).<br/><br/>Over the past year I've been thinking a lot about how to make software engineering much much faster. This culminated in me building <a href="https://kolo.app">Kolo</a> which brings some liveness/runtime inspection/visualisation to Django + VSCode. Kolo launched two weeks ago in alpha, so definitely still under heavy development and I'm taking in all the feedback I can. Hoping to contribute to the  #two-minute-week channel on occasion! :crossed_fingers:Oh and Iâ€™m based in London! :gb:
