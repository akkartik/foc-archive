Hi folks, I'm <a href="https://gfor.rest">Grant</a>. longtime (podcast) listener checking in from Raleigh, NC. Still taking the temperature on this community but I'd probably position my work on the practical side of things; I'm interested in new ideas insofar as they help me make the end products I dream about making, and more easily.<br/><br/>To that end I've been building out <a href="https://verdant.dev">my own local-first/crdt/multiplayer framework for the web</a> for the sake of building the <a href="https://gnocchi.club">grocery list of my dreams</a> and I've been having a lot of fun with that.<br/><br/>I'm in a bit of a lull at the moment and busy with a new kid, but I'm interested to see if there's any local connections in Raleigh in this community. I get fomo from all those cool London demo meetups.

I too was about to build the "grocery list of my dreams" just a few weeks ago, but used discipline and will power to stop myself and get back to abstract bluesky research, as usual. I now use Obsidian and Syncthing ... but I still dream, in my less guarded moments...

I'd be curious what your dream feature is. Always looking for new ideas. I will say, though, I thought Gnocchi would only take a few weeks to get right, but it's been 6 months of heavy work! The only saving grace is I put a lot of that time into my local-first framework which I hope to reuse for future dream projects.

Well, I was actually needing a generic to-do list, so I could tell you what my dream to-do list has? I'll just go ahead and dump my thoughts, since it's all fresh in my mind and seems relevant to this:<br/><br/>• ability to select the font (weight, color, slant) by tapping, between at least two options: usually "normal" with a bullet point and text, but then "done" with a different bullet point like "x" and strikethrough text<br/>• then ability to add more fonts to choose, such as adding faint or grey - this would be used in the case where I have a shopping list where most items are left on the list but greyed out; then I can tap them into "fetch me", with normal text, and "in the basket" with strikethrough<br/>• once I've done a shop, a global reset back to one font - in the shopping list case, back to greyed out ready for next time<br/>• all of this now doesn't make any distinction between a to-do item and a paragraph in a note: I'd also like to be able to make notes, then highlight and low-light and strike through any para at a time<br/>• ability to move one <em>or more</em> paras or to-dos up or down in a list, or between lists - quickly, without going through layers of menus<br/>• this is the most important one: ability to grab a link to any to-do or paragraph, then create a new list and just drop them in it; this way, I can make a daily list, with all the things I need to do and think about that day; any edits I do to the items will obviously be reflected back in the source list or note they came from<br/>ready by next week? Android please.

The thing about Obsidian that makes it a real grind is the way it exposes the Markdown level, so you're always editing that instead of to-dos or notes. And you have to flip between edit and view modes.<br/><br/>But it's the only tool of that kind that has autosave to file <em>and</em> auto-load when the underlying file has changed, meaning it works well with Syncthing.

Really interesting. Are you designing with the idea that the list is persistent and re-used after it's completed? i.e. always buying the same groceries? I do get this for things like weekend trip packing lists, which I use Google Keep for.

Gnocchi's paradigms are far too opinionated to even adapt to these ideas but I get the gist of what you mean and it could be cool, some emergent patterns might come out for individuals.

Yes I also have a holiday list that persists between holidays and an OCD list for locking up the house!
