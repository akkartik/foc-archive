This would be a device that's as easy to set up as an Amazon Echo and serves as the central place where personal data \/ communication is handled.\nThis topic is definitely related. Ideally, it wouldn't be required though. I imagine a distributed system that'd also work without a \"server\". For example, I'd like to be able to use data sync &amp; replication when only having my smartphone and laptop connected. This would lower the barrier of entry (no need to buy and set up another device to get started) of the system, but you'd be able to improve capacity, availability, etc by connecting such a home server device.",

Laptops, tablets and smartphones (which make up most of non-tech people's devices) aren't well suited for really persistent and safe data storage. Limitations are power-consumption, size \/ upgradability, availability, risk of loss, ...\nI've been thinking about what I've been calling Personal \/ End-User Home Servers, which is probably very close to what you're describing. This would be a device that's as easy to set up as an Amazon Echo and serves as the central place where personal data \/ communication is handled.\nThis topic is definitely related. Ideally, it wouldn't be required though. I imagine a distributed system that'd also work without a \"server\". For example, I'd like to be able to use data sync & replication when only having my smartphone and laptop connected. This would lower the barrier of entry (no need to buy and set up another device to get started) of the system, but you'd be able to improve capacity, availability, etc by connecting such a home server device."
