It's static, but entirely inferred so I'm not sure it carries the implication that you'd take from it having a "Static Type System"

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Doug Moen</span> and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jimmy Miller</span> — you're both building projects with a dynamic type system, using a statically typed language. On a cursory consideration, that feels very against-the-grain. Care to share your reasoning?

I have Chris's case too, but also if a type can't be inferred/narrowed statically, it reverts to dynamic

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> I'm building a runtime and virtual machine for a dynamically typed language. That is normally done in a systems language like C, C++, Rust, Zig, so you can have performance. Look at Python, Ruby, Javascript, Perl, etc, that's how it's done. I picked C++ because I'm familiar with it, but also because there are a lot of specialized 3D graphics libraries I'd like to link with that are in C++, and not replicated in other languages. Rust would be my second choice because there are an increasing number of interesting Rust crates for programming GPUs. C++ and Rust are both horrible, complex languages, with slow compilers, that kill your productivity. Any alternative language that I could switch to would be better in some ways, but would lock me into an ecosystem that would make some things I want to do extremely difficult or impossible. What if I want to build a small and performant native app, or a small and performance WebAssembly module, containing my language? Will Haskell or Python or Racket or O'Caml or Pharo get me there? I feel there are no good choices of implementation language.<br/><br/>My language is dynamically typed because I prefer dynamic typing, it's easier to implement a dynamically typed language, and it's the best choice for exploratory and live programming. Curv is a language for making art, not for <em>deploying applications</em> on a <em>server</em>, so why do my users need static typing?

Since this is Future of Coding, maybe we can discuss the ideal FoC implementation language for building your new language. Maybe we can design it and implement it as a group project. :grinning:

Re, your first comment: Ah, that all makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>Re, your second comment: I can't tell if this is a recursion joke or a serious suggestion. If it is a serious suggestion, I'd suggest starting a new thread with what you have in mind. I have it on good authority (ie: forthcoming survey results) that there are a lot of folks here looking to collaborate on a project, just waiting for someone to issue the call to arms.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> Mine is a bit related to Doug’s. But a bit different of a motivation.<br/><br/>I am building a very dynamic language.  A language that should have a very small core but with the power to implement most of the interesting things in itself.<br/><br/>I’ve done a bit of exploration building it in Clojure (my preferred language for many things) but found a few problems. First, the language I was making was being too heavily influenced by what was convenient for me to do in Clojure. I always ended up with a lispy thing just because I could do it quick. I know that if I stick with clojure those things will leak in more than I wanted and so I decided to not use it.<br/><br/>Second, and more importantly, I don’t want to spend time right now focused on speed, but I need an interpreter that is decently fast. Since most of the interesting things in my language should be implemented in itself, I will have a huge interpreter overhead. Of course, I could spend the time to optimize that away, but I’m still exploring the idea and optimization isn’t the interesting part. When I was doing things in clojure, my naive solution was already getting to the point where things weren’t interactive at the level I wanted them to be.<br/><br/>So for those reasons I chose Rust as my implementation language of choice. I know that in the future when I really care about the speed of everything I can make it fast. And for now, my super naive code is already fast enough for what I’m doing. I haven’t gotten quite to the point where I can really test the interpreter overhead. But I expect things to be fast enough that I can make all the ideas I have in my head in my language itself, keeping the rust I have to write to a very small amount (hopefully 500-1000 lines at most).
