The system uses a different svg path for backloops: normal nodes are connected using a bezier curve but when the output node is placed before the start node, the path changes to a \"back-loop\". \n\nAnother thing to notice is the layering.. the back-loop is placed on its own layer, hopefully keeping bigger flows more clear.
