So here are my half-baked thoughts anyway:\n\nI differentiate between spatial programming and spatial computing.\nIn spatial programming, we have more spatial, more visual ways to describe a program than a plain text file. E.g. all the nodes n' arrows \/ graph representation of computation but there are for sure other approaches as well. It is all about finding more visual, more humane ways of representing programs.\nIn spatial computing on the other hand, the atomic units of memory are spatial and the operations that transform them are too. E.g. the above mentioned robust-first programming, all kinds of cellular automata or <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9G0r7jL3xl8|Scott Kim's Viewpoint >system (<https:\/\/worrydream.com\/refs\/Kim_1988_-_Viewpoint,_Toward_a_Computer_for_Visual_Thinkers.pdf|dissertation PDF>)\n\nIt seems to me that there is far more exploration in the former field and very little interesting work in the latter. Why? Here is my theory:\nWhen you build a spatial programming system, you have a vision and an intuition on how exactly it should feel to code and then you go there, use your barely-spatial, text-based programming toolbox to make this vision come true. You have a clear goal to work towards, a problem to solve, convergent thinking to do. This style of work is taught at the engineering departments. Those engineers are the ones with the knowledge to do the exploration in the first place. Also, this serves the ego very well. You have a vision and you leave an imprint on the world by making it come true.\nWhen you build a spatial computing system, you don't build a product, you don't work towards a clear goal. What you do is you create a new medium in which to build. It is hard to predict what you or others are going to build in the new medium. The outcome and the benefits are a lot more nebulous. It requires more divergent thinking, which is more likely taught in art schools, not engineering schools. I view it more like the act of planting a seed and then modestly taking a step back and letting it grow on it's own. Less ego involved here.\n\nI think we should find other, more spatial representations of programs, but those should build upon a spatial model of computation. Trying to build a spatial programming system straight on the basis of the conventional, text\/byte based tools means going against the grain of that medium. We should first build a spatial medium for computation and from there, visual\/spatial representations of programs will emerge naturally.\n\nThe work of Scott Kim is an awesome step in that direction, even though the system could not be programmed \"from the inside\". In Kim's Viewpoint system, the smallest unit of memory is a pixel, which, even if embedded into a 2D grid, is still tightly married to the idea of a byte.\nTo expand upon this, I started to work on a system where the lowest unit of memory is a 2D line segment with a set of tags. Line segments are addressed not by their distance to some nullptr or their Cartesian coordinates on a pixel grid but by queries on the 2D canvas (e.g. \"all lines with tag X, left of line Y\" or \"all lines touching line X without tag Y\") and the basic operations\/the instruction set are all about geometric transformation of those line segments.\nI should have a wasm-backed demo running with a cheatsheet, example code and some basic documentation by the end of next week for you to try out :slightly_smiling_face:",
