Could someone create a web browser or browser extension that just adds bidirectional links navigation, filtering, and querying to the web more broadly? Any reason that can’t just be layered on top of URLs already existing on the web?

Depending on exactly what you're asking for there's no reason other than inertia. For it to become useful you need a critical mass of people contributing to it.

The most obvious approach I can picture would just be taking URL links that already exist as backlinks. Why would that need a critical mass of people contributing to it?

Ah, got it, just turning existing links into backlinks, I had misunderstood you!<br/><br/>This is certainly possible, though there are some very real challenges!<br/><br/>• a bootstrap problem, if you care about links between different domains then it's always going to be incomplete, period, and it's probably going to miss the one important link you're looking for unless you're indexing most of the web. Indexing most of the web is quite expensive! So it'll be hard to get paying customers without first spending a lot of money.<br/>• The web is mostly trash, so you'll need to put a lot of effort into filtering out the unimportant backlinks<br/>• You'll probably never be able to index links from places like Facebook and Instagram, and it'll be very difficult to index links from places like Twitter. A large amount of activity goes on in there that you won't have access to!

In a fundamental sense, it's not possible because linking is a one-way action. I can link to your website from an HTML file hosted off this laptop - how would you ever know?<br/><br/>In a practical sense you can probably get close because of how much tracking there is in the real internet. I would look into Google Analytics API for that. Or you could try some heuristic like the following Google search; <tt>"<a href="http://futureofcoding.org">futureofcoding.org</a>" -&lt;site:futureofcoding.org&gt;</tt> which searches for a URL, excluding from that domain itself.

Google makes it very hard to look for links in this way because revealing too much about which links Google recognizes would greatly help spammers. I think to make anything useful you would have to do your own crawling, probably starting from an index like Common Crawl.

What sort order would you like to use for the backlinks? A page on a popular site can have hundreds of thousands of incoming links...

i’m working on an adjacent problem, using user browsing history/bookmarks as a kind of peer-based/social webcrawler for the backend of this idea. DM me if you want to chat!
