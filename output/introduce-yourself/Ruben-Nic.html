Hello everyone. :wave:<br/><br/>I want to reinvent programming, or help anyone else who is, because I fear that we are squandering human achievement otherwise. Computers are the pinnacle of human invention, a universal machine, and we have locked their use behind a techno priesthood who speak arcane runes. Instead of computers becoming the bicycle of the mind we have created TV 2.0. It seems ridiculous and hugely inefficient to me that the people with domain specific knowledge need to hire others to encode that knowledge into a computer program. We should create tools to enable the domain expert.<br/><br/>I’m currently working on a bimodal visualization of React Components. Bimodal because both the visual and the textual views are first class meaning changes are propagated to the other. I’m very interested in bimodal types of programming as I feel that while text is great at expressing detail, it isn’t as effective as visuals in communicating structure and relationships. I’m limiting this tool to React Components because I’m unsure if this tool will actually be very effective and I want a well defined and small space to play in.<br/><br/>If anyone wants to grab a beer/coffee/tea in Pittsburgh, PA and talk programming just DM me.
