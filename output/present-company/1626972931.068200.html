Hi guys! I'd like to ask for advice :heart:<br/><br/>Our user base growth is slow. We discovered that 90% of people downloading it don't get through the first steps â€“ our onboarding and guidance sucks and we are working on it right now. Fixing it will take us a few weeks.<br/><br/>So, we come to an idea to manually onboard users by building any data analytics / data-driven process automation for companies that they need (for free and with no additional license cost - our product is Open Source and Free on Desktop usage). Our product, Enso (<a href="https://enso.org">https://enso.org</a>) is really powerful - think of it like about Alteryx (<a href="https://alteryx.com">https://alteryx.com</a>, $500M ARR), but more interactive, with better visualisations, and worse onboarding.<br/><br/><b><b>I would be very, very thankful for any advice on how to find / reach out to companies who might benefit from using Enso and would allow us to grow the user base faster. Would you mind sharing some ideas?</b></b> :)

I've downloaded and uninstalled enso a few times (since back when it was Luna). Each time I really want it to work but have found myself disappointed.  Last time I did this was a few weeks ago when it hit hacker news. <br/><br/>I ran into quite a few issue using it including long (multiple minute) freezes. I was trying to process a 2mb json file and I could not get it to work without locking up after multiple attempts. <br/><br/>That said, I'd absolutely love a tool like enso, so if you every want to chat happy to help as well :)

I've had a similar experience - been following the project for a long time and like a lot of the ideas. Unfortunately, one big caveat for slightly larger projects was how you'd get so many default variable names that started to make anything long unwieldy. The text/visual syntax is cool, but the default naming scheme and even in the tutorials suggesting you to just link nodes (thus creating a ton of <tt>operator7</tt> etc.) means that you lose a lot of semantic meaning when going back to understand the code.<br/><br/>Just like how using single characters for all your variables in standard languages is bad practice, this default naming really gets in the way of maintaining and understanding code - a problem that the visual interface was supposed to solve, not introduce. I'm sure there could be interesting ideas of working around it (direct links convert to pipe-like syntax, only when multiple nodes refer to the same one is a name prompted for, etc.)
