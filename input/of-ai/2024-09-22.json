Sticking with our beloved bicycle example, Ivan Illich argued in <https:\/\/blogs.ubc.ca\/landscapesofenergy\/files\/2010\/11\/ivan-illich-energy_and_equity.pdf|“Energy and Equity”> that vehicles shouldn’t be allowed to travel faster than bicycles: “Participatory democracy demands low-energy technology, and free people must travel the road to productive social relations at the speed of a bicycle… Beyond a certain speed, motorized vehicles create remoteness which they alone can shrink.”\n\nI don’t know how convinced I am by that specific argument in that situation. But I do think it’s important not to assume that a free-market “build the right empowering thing and it will push out the bad things!” solution is the only option we have available. It’s nice when that works, but sometimes you have to actually do politics, and negotiate agreements as a society about how things should work. I don’t think that’s the same thing as “authoritarianism”. (Naturally, minarchists do think these are the same thing, but I imagine many of us have less radical views than that.)",

But I do think it’s important not to assume that a free-market “build the right empowering thing and it will push out the bad things!” solution is the only option we have available. It’s nice when that works, but sometimes you have to actually do politics, and negotiate agreements as a society about how things should work. I don’t think that’s the same thing as “authoritarianism”. (Naturally, minarchists do think these are the same thing, but I imagine many of us have less radical views than that.)"
