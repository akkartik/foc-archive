I'm here both for my personal interest and my day job, as I work at the firm behind HighGear, which is a no code workflow platform. We enable business analysts to implement sophisticated business process requirements in an ergonomic and powerful visual programming language. I understand that the no code movement has some bad rep in this community, and I (and we) are not threatened by that. I'm excited to learn more about and discuss the future of programming and computing with you all!\n"
