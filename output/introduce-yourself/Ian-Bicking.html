Hi! I’m Ian (but you could tell that already), from Minneapolis.<br/><br/>I’m particularly interested in programming environments – for instance, notebook interfaces seem like the most notable programming exploration of the moment. But the specific project I’ve been mulling over and experimenting with is using fully automated testing (like fuzzing) of interactive applications to collect execution information to support the programmer. I imagine a system where you can get a map of what the application actually does (intentional or not), and then you can explore down into <em>why</em> it does those things.<br/><br/>But it’s a side project, so maybe more dream than reality, but I’m sure I’m not alone :wink:
