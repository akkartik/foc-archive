interesting have you seen the discussions here about the zettelkasten method? I still think it could provide a valuable way for asynchronous information exchange. To track the steps a person took to gain understanding in a certain topic landscape.

I did, and I kind of use it for my own notes. <br/>What made you make the connection?

• I think the zettelkasten method is by far very under appreciated. Its properties bend very nicely towards the human style of thinking. Because a single note/zettel is not that import but the connections between notes is. Thats us - humans we remember connections. We can not relate to a object on its own it can not make sense to us. Also that you have to take a certain amount of notes before you can see that clusters do emerge. That phenomenon when you learn a new topic and can't yet orient yourself very well but with every wave the see rises and eventually encloses the nut:      <a href="https://twitter.com/kmett/status/552926129284481024">https://twitter.com/kmett/status/552926129284481024</a>    <br/>

Again I would love to see zettelkasten repositories to take a peek into thought patterns and structures of other people. I have used a git repository with markdown files to take notes myself but I'm still pondering how to make this representation useful to others..

Ha, give me a few more months… hmm… years(?)… I hope to eventually get to publishing some more interesting insights on my blog which I got out of research I’ve done relating to how people take notes. <br/><br/>I went into it with the expectation that each of the 20 people I talked to will have a unique process tailored to them individually. And in a way that’s true, but I was also blown away by how the motivations, objectives, and even structures they employ are not at all unique and there is tremendous overlap. Individuality in note taking seems to be mostly coming from us using different tools. It’s something where our tools clearly shape us, but we haven’t really put much thought into how we designed these tools. We still use glorified type writers, essentially. Also why I have a particular opinion about programming tools…<br/><br/>In connection to what I learned from cognitive science about categorization, I’ve been trying to build a useful model of how we manage personal knowledge with digital tools and what the common patterns are. <br/><br/>For sure our minds have strong associative capabilities, making spontaneous connections between previously unconnected ideas. On the other hand, however, we are also extremely good at communicating in linear narratives, where complex structure is woven into a sequence of ideas to form a compelling story.<br/><br/>In a way I’d argue that we constantly turn linear narratives into associations, which we could call learning, and the opposite, which we could call teaching.<br/><br/>My hypothesis is that if we understand the two directions of this process better, we can build better tools for thinking (or note taking, as a sub-category). <br/>I should probably consider spending less time talking about it in forums and more time actually building these tools…

By no means feel any pressure! My notes lack coherence from an outside as well inside perspective they are all mixed up with private notes. So its a difficult thing to untangle and its also something which I don't haveva good solution for yet

Thank you for the comment about linear narratives and associations. I haven't thought about this deeper but it seems very relevant to me.
