Now, you want to extract out, elements 1,2, and 7 out of the result and then store it as y which you will pipe through another set of transformations to produce z. So rewinding the story so far, we have x morphing into y morphing into z. Now, in a typical bound set up, the changes in x will be continuously mirrored to y and z. What I meant by static is, y when reified\/extracted out of this abstract chain, will become a sort of end product of the transformation of x and  then become a non-live value changing\/parametrizing which will change z independent of transformations that can happen to x.
