Watching ["The Role of Computer Science in Computer Science Education"](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAUl7w_2YYY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAUl7w_2YYY</a>) by Shriram Krishnamurthi yesterday, I realized that much of what he says about teaching CS also applied to "end users". The common point is the need to be shielded from the complexities of a professional-oriented programming system. But then I also wonder if "end user programming" should be designed to be a first level of several that lead to a professional level. End users would thus be seen as life-long learners who advance at their own rhythm, possibly never going all the way to professional.
