I found the community via a recommendation from <https:\/\/taylor.town\/|Taylor Troesh> when lamenting the end of the Strange Loop conference. I host the <https:\/\/elm.town|Elm Town podcast> where I interview folks through their software engineering journeys to understand why they are in the Elm community and how they got there. Sometimes I talk with folks outside of the Elm community when it relates to Elm.\n\nI’m interested in unique perspectives and ideas in humanity, computing and beyond. I’m also interested in the way technology integrates into nature. If this community advances human-computer interaction, I am interested in technology-nature interaction. That is, how to make our technology more in-harmony with nature (sustainable, balanced, and connected). It’s not a binary distinction nor two-dimensional. We come from nature and by extension, so does technology. But we think of ourselves as outside of nature. I’m interested in challenging that assumption in order to enjoy our creations without burning down the house.",
