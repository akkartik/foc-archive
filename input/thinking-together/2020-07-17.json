Wisdom was to be set where it could be ruthless. Once such a system existed, though, the qualities required to rise in it had much more to do with ruthlessness than with wisdom. Lenin's core of original Bolsheviks, and the socialists like Trotsky who joined them, were many of them highly educated people, literate in multiple European languages, learned in the scholastic traditions of Marxism; and they preserved these attributes even as they murdered and lied and tortured and terrorised. They were social scientists who thought principle required them to behave like gangsters. But their successors -- the _vydvizhentsy_ who refilled the Central Committee in the thirties -- were not the most selfless people in Soviet society, or the most principled, or the most scrupulous. They were the most ambitious, the most domineering, the most manipulative, the most greedy, the most sycophantic.

His associates, too, tended to possess treasured collections of Marxist literature. It was one of Molotov's complaints, after Stalin's death, that by sending him off to be ambassador of Outer Mongolia, Khrushchev had parted him from his books.

I really like Joseph Schumpeter's ideas of creative destruction (<https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Creative_destruction>).\n\nThe problem I see is that entities often live _too long_, outliving their original purpose. Governments grow corrupt, companies turn into monopolies, bureaucracies get captured (<https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Regulatory_capture>), open source projects make user-hostile changes or refuse to consider reasonable patches (\/s :wink:). Corrupt governments eventually die, but the process is painful and can require bloodshed. Monopolies eventually die, but can cause a lot of pain to their customers and the commonwealth before they do. Bureaucracies eventually get replaced and defunded, but they live the longest of all. Open source patches are eventually replaced, but they live longest of all because of the troubles of testing a new dependency (\/s :wink:).\n\nSo the problem, the way I see it, is to create incentives for capitalist endeavor, but not allow them to grow too far unboundedly. A high top tax bracket is one fairly blunt way to achieve this. Authoritarianism that sometimes goes by the name of Communism (<https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Khmer_Rouge>) is an even more blunt approach. And the blunt ways are not sustainable. Tax brackets get loopholed to death or lobbied to death. Communism gets outcompeted outside its borders because it leaves _no_ incentive for endeavor, while being just as prone to corruption internally as anything else.\n\nNo, the most natural way to keep outcomes bounded is to increase competition. And you can't will competition into existence, regardless of Anti-trust laws and Patent laws. The most natural way to foster competition, IMO, is for people to be educated about the geopolitical effects of their actions. If you see this thing you use get too popular, it should be easy to switch to the next most popular thing. If there isn't one, it shouldn't be too difficult for _someone_ to create. And if you see no competition for some good, maybe you should be more careful about growing addicted to it. It's not lack of payment that makes you the product, it's lock-in.\n\nOne can argue about whether the presence of competition beyond some point leads to death or an evergreen organism. If a country can swing from socialism to capitalism every ten years or so, is it dying painlessly at each bloodless revolution or just evergreen? If a company can reinvent itself to go from selling adding machines to computers to computer services, is it dying at each of those phase boundaries or really 110 years old? Imagine a bureaucracy that grows an arm to disrupt itself everytime it starts to grow lethargic. Or an open source project whose users can easily swarm to a new fork when the old one stops meeting their needs.",

It's not lack of payment that makes you the product, it's lock-in.\n\nOne can argue about whether the presence of competition beyond some point leads to death or an evergreen organism. If a country can swing from socialism to capitalism every ten years or so, is it dying painlessly at each bloodless revolution or just evergreen? If a company can reinvent itself to go from selling adding machines to computers to computer services, is it dying at each of those phase boundaries or really 110 years old? Imagine a bureaucracy that grows an arm to disrupt itself everytime it starts to grow lethargic. Or an open source project whose users can easily swarm to a new fork when the old one stops meeting their needs."

In the future what I'd like to see is version control integrated with the reflective capabilities of software, whether it be through debuggers,  typechecking, testing, contracts, layers, etc. Unison has a very interesting approach to this problem by hashing code AST directly. That said, I do think the bulk of things cam be agreed on, and should be agreed on, at least at the level of some critical mass. I'm thinking of software like emacs, which is extremely malleable, but still has a core set of stuff people generally don't mess with.\n\nAs for mastodon, yeah it's a mess I have no intention to touch with a 20m pole. Couldn't even implement DMs in a sane way, it's irresponsible. Somehow pleroma, which appears to have a saner backend, has an even slower than twitter frontend, etc etc. I'm,not one to post stuff publicly anyway. I'm just really happy <http:\/\/nitter.net|nitter.net> exists, keeps me sane.\n\n<@UCUSW7WVD> You're point about entities living too long is exactly on point. I'm not too sure about the parts on capitalist endevour, mostly because I'm skeptical monetary incentives can really motivate after a point, even when it might be necessary. For example, I blows my mind how fast software rots, the only people who seem to produce finished software are hobbyists, mostly because that can't afford not to. I suppose with enough competition the kind of wasteful behavior you see in tech today wouldn't be an issue, but then barriers to entry become an issue. I agree about competition, but I think another key part is to raise the floor for people to build things, thougg that's largely more of a purely societal issue. It's funny, because the way I see it, it's mostly an allocation problem—even after all the bad things I said about mastodon earlier, it doesn't change the fact that it is thriving, and on a fraction of the budget twitter has. I would handwavely estimate that you probably would need significantly less than a single major vc round to really fix a lot of fundamental issues in software if they were allocated to the right people. It still blows my mind that significant amounts of core infrastructure is maintained by people who are probably less well-off than me, I have seen people maintaining foss projects used to make millions that have core developers that have trouble getting food on the table.\n\nI also agree about education, after all every human institution is made up of people, no matter how easy it is to forget. There's no point in discussing institutions if you don't give the people in them agency.\n\nAlso fully agree about lock-in being the big bad.\n\nOn death vs. evergreen, I'd be firmly on the evergreen side, that's ecology working as intended.\n\nAs for Beer, you should start by reading Designing Freedom. He's kind of handwavy when it comes to concrete actions, but his conceptualization of things helps me a lot.\n\nFaré himself has written about how he's more of a navelgazer ;)\n\nRegarding information, I agree that critical thinking is the harder problem, in fact I think the current information landscape (infoscape?) 's issues with constant semantic denial of service style attacks is solvable with current technology and a lot of social work. Education is hard and my intuition tells me that the world would have to be close to completely unrecognizable for it to even begin to be a tractable problem. A good start would be raising the floor economically and socially, along the lines of maslow's hierarchy. At the end of the day, if people don't want to be educated, what are you going to do about it? I was reading James Scott's Art _of Not Being Governed_ recently, and he makes the point that you can consider illiteracy as an adaptation to exit civilization and stay out. We quickly end up with thorny normative issues regarding big words like freedom, human rights, etc. That said, I do think that the more pressing issue is hygiene, I am worried that such an parasitic infoscape entities may become too deeply entrenched if we don't fix the issue soon. Technology has a tendency to stick around and reify our past mistakes, and the stakes only get higher.\n\nAs for state space, my crux of my point was that although I don't think it's hard to get into the desirable state space region, it is exceedingly hard to build institutions that stay in it, and I think it's impossible in general. So you want to be able to able to move through your state space is a discontinuous fashion when necessary (i.e more radical measures, like a rewrite). Simple is important for discontinuous changes, because otherwise they aren't possible.\n\nYour idea about unit tests is interesting because it reduces the size of the state space. Something that I'm looking forward too over the next decade is seeing dependent typing and theorem provers coming into the mainstream, and seeing if someone can distill something nice and simple out of it. I was learning F* earlier, and it's quite neat technology.\n\nThe general version of your unit tests idea is that we need better, more consistent and reliable ways of encoding the behavior of our programs in our programs, this kind of reasoning is usually called reflection but I hesitate to use it due to the association with stuff like eval(). This is closely related to metaprogramming, because we need to write higher-order programs, just like we have higher-order logics to encode behavior of lower-order logics. We have a very developed syntactic metaprogramming in the lisp tradition, but metaprogramming with semantics is still quite underdeveloped, I have a hunch this is related to foundational issues in mathematical logic though so I'm not sure if this will ever take off. At any rate, people are kind of working on it with stuff like multi-stage programming, and I'm excited to see them become more expressive.",

He's kind of handwavy when it comes to concrete actions, but his conceptualization of things helps me a lot.\n\nFaré himself has written about how he's more of a navelgazer ;)\n\nRegarding information, I agree that critical thinking is the harder problem, in fact I think the current information landscape (infoscape?) 's issues with constant semantic denial of service style attacks is solvable with current technology and a lot of social work. Education is hard and my intuition tells me that the world would have to be close to completely unrecognizable for it to even begin to be a tractable problem. A good start would be raising the floor economically and socially, along the lines of maslow's hierarchy. At the end of the day, if people don't want to be educated, what are you going to do about it? I was reading James Scott's Art "

We quickly end up with thorny normative issues regarding big words like freedom, human rights, etc. That said, I do think that the more pressing issue is hygiene, I am worried that such an parasitic infoscape entities may become too deeply entrenched if we don't fix the issue soon. Technology has a tendency to stick around and reify our past mistakes, and the stakes only get higher.\n\nAs for state space, my crux of my point was that although I don't think it's hard to get into the desirable state space region, it is exceedingly hard to build institutions that stay in it, and I think it's impossible in general. So you want to be able to able to move through your state space is a discontinuous fashion when necessary (i.e more radical measures, like a rewrite). Simple is important for discontinuous changes, because otherwise they aren't possible.\n\nYour idea about unit tests is interesting because it reduces the size of the state space. Something that I'm looking forward too over the next decade is seeing dependent typing and theorem provers coming into the mainstream, and seeing if someone can distill something nice and simple out of it. I was learning F* earlier, and it's quite neat technology.\n\nThe general version of your unit tests idea is that we need better, more consistent and reliable ways of encoding the behavior of our programs in our programs, this kind of reasoning is usually called reflection but I hesitate to use it due to the association with stuff like eval(). This is closely related to metaprogramming, because we need to write higher-order programs, just like we have higher-order logics to encode behavior of lower-order logics. We have a very developed syntactic metaprogramming in the lisp tradition, but metaprogramming with semantics is still quite underdeveloped, I have a hunch this is related to foundational issues in mathematical logic though so I'm not sure if this will ever take off. At any rate, people are kind of working on it with stuff like multi-stage programming, and I'm excited to see them become more expressive."
