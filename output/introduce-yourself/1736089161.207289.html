Hi everyone, I'm Matt (<a href="https://x.com/mattrasmus">https://x.com/mattrasmus</a>). I got into future of coding/thinking topics originally when I wrote my own note-taking app called KeepNote (<a href="https://keepnote.org/">https://keepnote.org/</a>, unmaintained) during grad school. The experience made me appreciate how powerful it can be to refer back to previous ideas and make new connections in my research (computational biology at the time). I am now interested in how note-taking can be viewed as a form of personal Data Engineering. That is, you could imagine an individual benefiting from similar activities that you find at a company-wide level: data capture into an unorganized data lake, ETLs that transform data into analysis friendly forms, personal dashboards and alerts of things that are important to you, etc.<br/><br/>More recently in my day job, I developed a flexible workflow engine redun (<a href="https://github.com/insitro/redun">https://github.com/insitro/redun</a>), mainly for scientific compute. However, the project has made me think again about the opportunities of blending workflow engines with personal note databases. The development of LLMs acting as assistants to help autogenerate code or call tools also seems like a chance to lower the bar for automatic compute over ones thoughts captured in their notes. I'm not entirely sure yet how it all fits together yet, but I've been trying prototypes and reading up on other people's explorations of these ideas.<br/><br/>I have followed the podcast and Ink and Switch work for years for inspiration on these topics. Looking forward to meeting you all and discussing more.
