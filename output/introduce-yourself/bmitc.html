Hello! Most of my career has seen me working in a visual programming language, namely LabVIEW. Because of this experience, when I move to my other favorite languages like F# or Racket, it feels like 2 steps forward and 3 steps backwards, primarily when it comes to being able to debugging and especially while the program is running. I am inspired by visual languages like vvvv, Pure Data, and TouchDesigner, and I am convinced that the future of programming is a hybrid approach, where there is tight integration but blurred lines between what is textually and visually specified. I am learning Pure Data and vvvv at the moment, and still have it on my plate to learn Touch Designer and Pharo, all the while I am working on designing my own language while also learning how to generally do so. :) The trouble is I'm not the smartest tool in the shed, so progress is slow but becoming tangible.
