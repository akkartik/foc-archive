So I agree that Object-Relational Mapping is silly and annoying, but that's really due to a mismatch between query languages and programming languages, and the actual DB engines that store physical data and execute those queries aren't really important from a UX standpoint. So the real question is: how can you bring query languages, "persistent data" and "ephemeral data" closer together? Can you have a uniform way to address all three? This is what Eve was doing (IMO). So Cypher is interesting, but wouldn't worry about DB <b>engines</b>. <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Granger</span> can speak more to that I guess.
