The typical metaphor for hyper time is actually, exactly the laying down rail road tracks you gave in the podcast. Imagine you are laying down tracks, tracks already laid are the past, the leading edge of the track is the present.

Suppose we decide to remove the latest three tracks (rewinding time) and replace the blue track with a red track. Now how do we talk about that? If we say something like “in the past there was a blue track”, we are speaking incorrectly in some sense. The “past” refers to the tracks that are not at the leading edge, and if we search those tracks there are no blue ones.\n\nInstead we can say that in the “hyper-past” there was a blue track.
