I like this idea. I feel like we need to make a big effort to bring more people into the community, with a primary focus on women. A survey is inherently the sort of project that calls people to it, so an inclusion-focused survey would send a signal to the broader community that this is something we care about. In this thread, I'd like to workshop what that survey could ask, what the audience for the survey should be, when we should send it out, how we could best maximize impact, what we'd like the outcome to be, whether this survey could be paired with another initiative that'd also help boost diversity, etc.",
