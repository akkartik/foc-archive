So while he writes that his putative recruits will be having conversations about \"Computational rationality: A converging paradigm for intelligence in brains, minds, and machines,\" I suspect he knows that, in the words of a colleague, the day job will revolve around \"political and policy trade-offs, persuasion, compromise, coalition-building, arm-twisting and finely balanced judgment calls.\" He may threaten to \"bin\" anyone found playing office politics, but Downing Street is a political office, and that is what people play—and the people who play it best get things done.\n\nIndeed, from my time there, the most effective official was never much of a science whizz, but a genius at the art of wringing progress out of the machine: brilliant at knowing the right person, crafting the best email, plotting the way through the chancellor in the right bar with the right Treasury official—a Machiavellian able to convince anyone he was on their side. He'd be a superb adornment to No 10. What a pity, I fear the rascal studied history."
