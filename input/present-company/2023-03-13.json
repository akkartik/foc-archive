My compulsion is then to refactor the page into several new pages, keeping the ideas that seem \"good\" and deleting or deprecating the ideas that turned out to be \"bad\". But refactoring my notes tends to take a fair amount of time, and I'm not sure it's worth the cost. There's a reasonable chance I will never read the notes again, because what was valuable about the note-writing was the _ideas_ that developed in my mind _as I was writing them_.\n\nThe _exercise_ had value. But the notes resulting from the exercise may not have much value.\n\nThus, I've begun to wonder whether I would appreciate a note-taking app that *locks you out of your old notes*. Perhaps this happens if you haven't touched a note for a few days, or maybe it happens overnight, every night.\n\nImmutable notes aren't a new idea. Humans have been writing immutable notes ever since they started carving glyphs into stone.\n\nComputers have given us the ability to endlessly edit a page of text. But maybe having mutable pages is detrimental, for many kinds of note-taking.\n\nFood for thought :thinking_face:.",
