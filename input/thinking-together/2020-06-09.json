It's too easy to dismiss human concerns because \"all that matters\" is what happens in the computer.\n\n\"The computer doesn't know about variable names, what does it matter we call it Master\/Slave\", \"We just need a bitmap to test this algorithm, what does it matter it's from Playboy\",  etc etc.\n\nThen if somebody raises concerns with these, they are immediately seen as causing a needless nuisance, and also have a kind of stain on their tech credentials because they appear to be caring about something that doesn't effect the compiled binary."
