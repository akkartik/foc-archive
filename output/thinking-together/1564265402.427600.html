I think there’s two important claims in what you’ve said: 1) the “future of coding” (FOC) community needs a single leader to be more effective in seeing change in the world, and 2) Steve is the best person today to satisfy that role. As a PhD student working in between PL/systems/HCI, I think point #1 is a critical discussion to have, since, the academic side of FOC is relatively nascent and open to change, e.g. the PLATEAU workshop (<a href="http://plateau-workshop.org/">http://plateau-workshop.org/</a>) is hosting a special section on articulating standards of research/discourse for academic research in this area. So, I appreciate that you’re making a stand and opening the discussion, Dan.<br/><br/>That said, I pretty strongly disagree with you on both counts. Historically, I think most cutting-edge progress in computer science has been made in decentralized academic communities, not in projects driven by a single leader with a vision. This is true both of industry research labs (Bell Labs and Xerox PARC before, FB/Google/MSR today) and particularly true of academic subfields. Of course, within these subfields, prominent individuals drive progress and set the tone of the discourse, but they do not command any intrinsic influence over other researchers. All ideas are subject to peer review. What’s made these communities work is having space, time, and money to allow a group of smart people to freely collaborate on forward-looking projects, <em>not</em> a central direction or leader.<br/><br/>To mention point #2, the argument above also highlights the really awesome work Steve has done: such a space/time/community does not exist for FOC yet, and so Steve has done the hard work of building the infrastructure (Slack/podcast/etc.) for relevant folks to disseminate their ideas and talk with others. However, I don’t think Steve, or really anyone in the broader FOC community (myself included), has a strong vision that I would agree with. (I want to avoid this discussion being too much a referendum on Steve’s character, since that would almost certainly not be productive, but I’m mostly going to refer to the ideas outlined in <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/about)">https://futureofcoding.org/about)</a>. For example, I think a lot of discourse in the community tends to follow in the mold of “Out of the Tarpit”, which is extremely general in discussing ideas like “complexity” or “abstraction” or even “state” really. I’m extremely skeptical of visions for the future that are founded in mechanisms (e.g. a language with or without XYZ features), as opposed to applications (e.g. we want to make a new kind of interaction/way of thought possible, or we want to specifically eliminate a class of bugs in this application space,). Again speaking historically, I would say the vast majority of good ideas started from concrete systems and applications, not broad theorizing.<br/><br/>Bret Victor is an easy one to praise in this community, but I do think he does a better job than most researchers at articulating a believable vision for the future. His poster (<a href="http://worrydream.com/cdg/ResearchAgenda-v0.19-poster.pdf">http://worrydream.com/cdg/ResearchAgenda-v0.19-poster.pdf</a>) is a fabulous example. But I have yet to see its equivalent for programming languages / large-scale systems.
