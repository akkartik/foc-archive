A 2021 problem set featuring three provocative quotes and asking the question, \"The perfect simulation of intelligence is intelligence. ... Is that true, though? In a short essay, explain why or why not.\" <https:\/\/philosophy.tamucc.edu\/courses\/spring-2021\/minds-and-machines\/problem-sets\/ps-02> Though \"the perfect simulation\" goes too far, we can daily confront \"a fairy iffy and sometimes surprising simulation\".  But the best bits...\n\nRobin Gandy, 1996:\n&gt; The 1950 paper was intended not so much as a penetrating contribution to philosophy but as propaganda. ... I can remember him reading aloud to me some of the passages--always with a smile, sometimes with a giggle. Some of the discussions of the paper I have read load it with more significance than it was intended to bear. I shall discuss it no further.\nJohn Haugeland, 1997:\n&gt; Why single out talking for special emphasis? ... Talking is not merely one intelligent ability among others, but also, and essentially, the ability to express intelligently a great many (maybe all) other intelligent abilities. And, without having those abilities in fact, at least to some degree, one cannot talk intelligently about them. That's why Turing's test is so compelling and powerful.\nDaniel Dennett, 1998:\n&gt; I am confident that no computer in the next twenty years is going to pass an unrestricted Turing test. They may well win the World Chess Championship or even a Nobel Prize in physics, but they won't pass the unrestricted Turing test. Nevertheless, it is not, I think, impossible in principle for a computer to pass the test, fair and square.\nCurt Jaimungal had a long conversation with Dennett shortly before he passed away <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bH553zzjQlI&amp;ab_channel=CurtJaimungal>.",
