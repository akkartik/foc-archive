i'm convinced my hypothesis was wrong. here are things i now believe to be true:<br/>- in a category, if there is an (A -&gt; B) âˆ˜ (B -&gt; C), there is a corresponding A -&gt; C. but there may be other A -&gt; C, too<br/>- furthermore, it's possible to for there to be multiple morphisms mapping an object to itself. however, the identity morphism appears to be unique.<br/>- the composition of an identity morphism with itself is not considered to be a different morphism than that same identity morphism<br/>- in the web example, the web is a category if webpages are objects and link-clicks are morphisms as long as refreshing a page counts as the identity morphism. a click on a self-link could be considered a distinct morphism from a refresh. or not. these would be two different categories<br/><br/>this comment captures my confusion about what types of identity matter in category theory (in the sense of distinctiveness, not in the sense of an identity function) <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/12/05/categories-great-and-small/#comment-36885">https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/12/05/categories-great-and-small/#comment-36885</a>
