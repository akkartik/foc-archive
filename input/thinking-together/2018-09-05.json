Pure functions -- not necessary. I think it's fine to keep pure functions as text for now and keep them as node content. This clicks with idea of splitting program into two languages living separate worlds: <https:\/\/twitter.com\/vladimir_vg\/status\/1035422044605829120>\n\n2) I like Erlang model of isolated processes and messages, and feels like something similar would be expressed in this graph code quite good.\n\n3) The actual execution might be also saved into graph, linked with code nodes. Imagine that you pick function or process and immediately see connections to different inputs from past. If we capture all IO into graph, then we may play out execution of the whole program.\n\n4) This programming environment surely gonna work with graphs, match against them. How matching against graph gonna look like in this graph language? Maybe this is the key to structure of code, clear analogy with Lisp and it's code as list.",

Dependencies and IO are ought to be expressed by nodes and edges. Pure functions -- not necessary. I think it's fine to keep pure functions as text for now and keep them as node content. This clicks with idea of splitting program into two languages living separate worlds: "

If we capture all IO into graph, then we may play out execution of the whole program.\n\n4) This programming environment surely gonna work with graphs, match against them.
