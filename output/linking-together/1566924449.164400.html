I don't think there are, that's just another way of phrasing my whole point here: To go back to the beginning, most of the reason people list for prefering tiling wms is because they are configurable, not because they tile windows.

there's a saying from Runar Bjarnsson that "constraints liberate; liberties constrain". i've seen this play out in many different parts of life. for example, guitar is in some ways not as versatile as piano, but i find songwriting easier on guitar because it's easier to play within patterns. and sometime, ukulele is even easier to improvise on, despite being less powerful.<br/><br/>but on another topic, just as a suggestion, i try to be mindful of the extent to which i'm asking other people to do my thinking for me. as an outside observer, it reads a bit like you asking folks to drag you over the cognitive hill to get to the destination they reached on their own, while at the same time, being kind of resistant to getting there.

Thanks for the feedback Alan, sorry I missed this until just now. There's definitely something I struggle with here, but unfortunately I have no idea what to do differently.

I'd like to respond more but I don't know what else to say. I'd love to climb up that cognitive hill, and I swear I am not deliberately trying to avoid it (quite the opposite in fact, I've been researching window management for years), but unfortunately I guess I'm just not smart enough to see the steps. :man-shrugging:

wish i had specific advice, other than  introspection. it helps me take a breath when i feel like the information flow isn't happening

Yeah, what muddles things more is that we finally got on the same page at the end. It seems that the miscommunication was that to me tiling windows and a set of configuration (e.g., keyboard shortcuts, layouts, etc...) are separate concepts, so I was pushing back when people were listing advantages that I would consider configuration, not tiling windows. But for others, the keyboard shortcuts and layouts are part of what a tiling window manager is. I not sure how to resolve that kind of misunderstanding earlier, it seems like others didn't understand that to me those two concepts are separate, and I certainly didn't understand that to others the configuration is <b>part of what a tiling window manager is</b>.
