I'm not sure I follow why APIs themselves are bad? An API separates implementation from interface, which is a way to allow the user to mentally manage less complexity. Peeking and poking memory directly maybe works when you know it is only text you are moving around, but I think that's a great example of something that doesn't scale- I don't want to have to know the internal implementation of every OS functionality in order to be able to use it. <br/><br/>Arguably a good API makes state querying and modification as easy or easier than your peek/poke example, and does so by organizing the shared data in a nicer way than flat memory, and organizing the procedures into related functionality that makes them easy to find, with minimal mutual interference in meaning and effect.
