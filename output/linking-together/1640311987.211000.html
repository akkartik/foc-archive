<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Peter van Hardenberg</span> was interviewed on the Metamuse podcast: <a href="https://museapp.com/podcast/46-industrial-research/">https://museapp.com/podcast/46-industrial-research/</a><br/><br/>It's a highly enjoyable episode from a consistently intriguing, motivating show. You probably already know about it, haha. But if you don't, well, you're in for a treat. I know I'm going to send it around to all my programmer friends who haven't yet blocked me for going on and on about the great need to take another run at the whole "tech industry" thing, fate of the world hanging in the balance, all that. It's a solid summary of the balance between forces of innovation (FANG, startups, government, academia), and as concise a summary of what Ink &amp; Switch <em>actually is</em> as seems possible given the current limits of the English language.<br/><br/>Inside baseball â€” Peter is is yet another guest on <em>that show</em> that I'm wishing I'd interviewed first on the FoC podcast. (They've had quite a few of them recently, hah.) Friendly inter-podcast rivalry intensifying!
