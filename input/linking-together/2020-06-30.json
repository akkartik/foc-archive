I had no problems installing it, and at first, just running singular files via ghci and playing with Haskell was really smooth experience for me and it took me a long way in learning Haskell. I did not yet bother installing Stack at this point.\n\nLater, when I wanted to do a proper project, Stack took care of the whole build process in a really nice way without requiring me to know much (although I did end up reading the whole documentation, so I wonder if maybe it was harder to get started with it than I remember).\n\nI did have some struggles setting up IDE in Emacs, but I found ghcid to be amazing, very easy to use option, and Haskell professionals recommended it as their tool of choice. Finally, after some time, I managed to set up Dante which now works ok, and I am currently looking forward to <https:\/\/github.com\/haskell\/haskell-language-server> .\nI believe Vim has less options than Emacs currently, but don't take me for my word.",

I had no problems installing it, and at first, just running singular files via ghci and playing with Haskell was really smooth experience for me and it took me a long way in learning Haskell. I did not yet bother installing Stack at this point.\n\nLater, when I wanted to do a proper project, Stack took care of the whole build process in a really nice way without requiring me to know much (although I did end up reading the whole documentation, so I wonder if maybe it was harder to get started with it than I remember).\n\nI did have some struggles setting up IDE in Emacs, but I found ghcid to be amazing, very easy to use option, and Haskell professionals recommended it as their tool of choice. Finally, after some time, I managed to set up Dante which now works ok, and I am currently looking forward to "

        "text": "To give a more productive example, I recently worked on Sonic Pi.  Along with adding visualizers and other code fixes, I reworked the build system to use CMake.  I removed some old projects, some manual build steps, even rewrote some code to remove the need for a big\/complicated library.  Eventually I got the build down from 20 or so steps that often didn't work down to 3 simple script commands to build the project and a windows installer - along with CI that builds the install binary on every submit.\nIMHO, on Windows, it was  extremely difficult to build a working binary.  You had to _really_ know your stuff to build the Ruby bits and the C++ bits, etc. and get a working binary.  Effectively, on Windows, I doubt that many developers who might have contributed to that excellent project would have got far enough to get a working executable.\nThis is the other side of the coin.

Eventually I got the build down from 20 or so steps that often didn't work down to 3 simple script commands to build the project and a windows installer - along with CI that builds the install binary on every submit.\nIMHO, on Windows, it was  extremely difficult to build a working binary.
