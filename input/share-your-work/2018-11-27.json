        "text": "<@UE6EFEPTQ> Thanks for your thoughts.\n\nRe: Turing-completeness – The system allows recursive function calls. For one example, go to <http:\/\/joshuahhh.com\/projects\/pane\/demo\/> and press \"square roots\". There's a function there called \"auto-improve guess\" which calls itself, to iteratively find a good-enough square root for a number. You can press the little \"[+]\" to expand out the recursive calls, which is fun, but pretty unwieldy. As you mention, I think providing a visualizable \"loop\" construct would be more useful, and in particular I think tail recursion is a good foundation for this.\n\nRe: I\/O – The function which calls out to an API is a total hack, and if it had an actual side-effect, or depended on sequencing, rather than being an quasi-pure function, its behavior would be totally unpredictable.

PANE is \/almost\/ usable by me. But I have put absolutely no effort into making it usable by anyone other than me. That's because the live demo isn't intended to be the sharable product of the research – the presentation is.\n\nI wanted to put the live demo online so that adventurous folk could mess with it. But now I worry that people may approach it with the wrong expectations, and waste their time or come away with what would be, in my opinion, an unfairly negative opinion of the project.\n\nIt doesn't sound like that was your experience. (Phew!) But I'm worried.\n\n(There's another version of this set of worries for the further step of posting the source code. As you can imagine, \"usability by anyone other than me\" drops exponentially from \"presentation\" to \"live demo\" to \"source code\".)",

PANE is \/almost\/ usable by me. But I have put absolutely no effort into making it usable by anyone other than me. That's because the live demo isn't intended to be the sharable product of the research – the presentation is.\n\nI wanted to put the live demo online so that adventurous folk could mess with it. But now I worry that people may approach it with the wrong expectations, and waste their time or come away with what would be, in my opinion, an unfairly negative opinion of the project.\n\nIt doesn't sound like that was your experience. (Phew!) But I'm worried.\n\n(There's another version of this set of worries for the further step of posting the source code. As you can imagine, \"usability by anyone other than me\" drops exponentially from \"presentation\" to \"live demo\" to \"source code\".)"
