Just a quick contribution, to voice my view without adding to much noise (well, I hope so). Globally I personally prefer to evolve in very diverse communities. When I came here one year ago, I was disappointed to find yet another male-only community. Well, in fact I am still here because the tone is not as bad as other male-only community I know, and there are very interesting and respectful discussions (thanks to all!). But the lack of diversity really concerns me. Diversity in general (don't you see from the survey that half of the people here are from USA?) but especially the lack of gender diversity: in one year, I guess I have seen less than ten messages from women. Alone, this fact is a problem for me. And when I hear that some people don't come in or don't participate because of some male-only "climate", it is a serious problem that's need to be addressed. So I also fully support Ivan in this effort, and on the difficult and tricky task to manage the recent hot discussions on the subject.
