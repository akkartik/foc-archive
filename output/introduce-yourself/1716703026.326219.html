Hard to follow after Karl's lovely intro above, but I'll try! :see_no_evil:<br/><br/>I'm <b>Jase</b>, a big nerd and product / software person. I'm an aspiring poet, blogger, entrepreneur and many other things that are still stretching their legs to hopefully one day make it off the ground.<br/><br/>I learned to code by customizing Myspace layouts for my junior high friends and their (very cool) bands. I failed out of Computer Engineering in college, did a bunch of soul searching, and eventually got my degree in Accounting to save face. I worked as an accountant for <b>3 whole months</b> before selling everything I owned and buying a one-way ticket to the Pacific Northwest to hitchhike and couch-surf my way to a more fitting future.<br/><br/><br/>My current career passion is making small processes that help focus a team's energy toward an actual problem that real people care about. This is a hurricane of pain and frustration, but when it works, it's so incredibly satisfying that I can't help but throw myself back in.<br/><br/>I care deeply about people on an individual level. I want to help shape a future that focuses on human-scale problems with human-scale solutions. I believe scale kills good products.<br/><br/>I'm currently developing an app that tells local stories anywhere in the US, with my business partner and very good friend. More importantly, we're building a collection of systems that help us make things and get feedback from real people. My ultimate goal is to use these systems to solve many small problems in unlame ways. I hope to start writing about these systems in the near future.<br/><br/><br/>I'm looking forward to exploring this space, and I'd love to have <a href="https://calendly.com/jasepellerin/30min">a 1-1 chat</a> with any of you about <b>anything at all</b>. Please don't hesitate to reach out, I'd love to hear from you :v::skin-tone-2:
