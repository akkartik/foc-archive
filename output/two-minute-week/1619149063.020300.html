Further fleshing out the Mu prototyping environment<br/><br/><a href="https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-2021-04-22">https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-2021-04-22</a><br/><br/>A big thank-you to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jack Rusher</span> for nudging me to prioritize graphics. It's had the unexpected side-effect of stress-testing the environment (programs drawing a pixel at a time easily get to large loop counts and array sizes) and uncovering all sorts of limitations that went unnoticed in my previous text-mode prototype (<a href="1607329853.147000.html">1607329853.147000.html</a>).<br/><br/>The Mu shell is still super slow and constantly runs out of memory. Partly I rationalize away that limitation by waving my hands and saying, "it's just for prototyping, throw away the prototype and rebuild it one level down." But interesting prototypes may well need to be large programs to truly test the right hypotheses. We'll see where this road leads.
