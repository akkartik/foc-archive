<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andreas S.</span> to echo Dave a little, but also from the perspective that I also had all of these questions not long ago. It's really tempting to jump into, "how do I do what I do today with computers on the MFM, robustly?" But I have had to get into the habit of checking myself a bit with these ideas. We have 80 years of evolved correct-and-efficient-only systems under our belts, resulting in our machines today. So hopefully we can lean on the idea that we know what's useful computationally, to not make it take another 80 years to implement these things in a robust, indefinite system, but also the long road will still be taken one step at a time. The other thing that has helped reframe these questions is that, what you see in many of Dave's demos, with atoms of elements doing really simple things, we have to really think that a handful of these elements won't often make a robust program. Instead, maybe thousands (or thousands of thousands more!) across many many tiles to really start to see programs that can act in a really robust and productive way. So the scaled viewport we're looking at right now is really zoomed in, and thus tough to even suppose answers to these bigger-picture questions.
