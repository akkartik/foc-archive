"Given the process that created JavaScript and made it a de facto standard, we deserve something far worse." — Douglas Crockford<br/><br/>"Lua is best described as a closed-development, open-source project.  Lua is not developed in a collaborative way. ... Lua provides mechanism not policy. ... Instead of littering the language with lots of features, we provided ways for users to program the features themselves, in the way they wanted them, and only for those features they needed. ... Most successful languages are raised rather than designed. ... We include a new feature in Lua only when all three of us agree." — The Evolution of Lua
