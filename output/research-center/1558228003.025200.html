Local: A good model is to create a non-profit research organization funded by a large grant from a tech billionaire. In my city, the Perimeter Institute is a successful research organization (in theoretical physics) that is funded by this model. For doing research, as opposed to product development, you need to fund multiple years of research without producing commercially profitable results. So a VC-funded startup or kickstarter funding is not a path to sustainable long term research funding.
