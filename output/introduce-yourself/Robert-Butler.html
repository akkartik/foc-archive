Hi everyone! I'm Robert. I'm working on designing a hobbyist processor architecture that is designed to fit in a single person's head. The ultimate goal is to get a full software stack sitting on top of it that is useful from micro-controllers to serious desktop processing, simple enough to be fully understandable by a single human mind and yet powerful enough to do so-called "real" work. I basically want to figure out how simple we can make our entire software stack and perhaps unlock even more potential in the world by doing so.
