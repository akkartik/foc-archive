Hey guys!<br/>Working on a node editor here and was curious to know if there are any similar projects out there that use auto-completion ?<br/>The idea is that you should get suggestions on what might be the best nodes that your current selection needs, regardless of whether you have those nodes in your graph or not. I can think of this vastly simplifying the loop concept for instance, where you'd suggest the user a loop node whenever they try to create a setup that requires one.<br/><br/>Another utility here would be suggestion highlights of possible connections that you can draw between a currently selected socket and all the ones in your graph.<br/><br/>Would love to know if there are projects out there that use a similar approach, just to make sure I'm not reinventing a wheel but improving one.

I feel like I've seen this in a few prototype visual languages, but I can't put my finger on where. Might also be the sort of thing people demoed as "This is a thing that should exist" rather than "This is a thing we're actually working on."<br/><br/>In any case... this is a thing that should exist! Please, share your progress here if you're working on this (so that I can include it in <a href="http://ivanish.ca/codex">http://ivanish.ca/codex</a> if nothing else!)

Waiting for some NDAs to lift off before I can start sharing lots of cool stuff, can't wait! :smiley:<br/><br/>And thanks for the reply! I suspected as much; I've heard about it somewhere as well but can't quite remember where. Regardless, will share my experiments on this as soon as I get something worth showing :pray:
