For those of you interested in Christopher Alexanderâ€™s work: The <b><a href="https://christopher-alexander-ces-archive.org/">Christopher Alexander &amp; Center for Environmental Structure Archive</a></b> is live. Here's an excerpt from Maggie Moore Alexander's announcement:<br/>&gt; This new website gives access to 50+ years of work by Alexander and colleagues at CES. The goal of this continuing endeavor is to share the work with all who wish to build and repair living environments in which people thrive.<br/>&gt; In total, the Archive includes some 29,000 items. About 50% of them have been catalogued to date and are listed on the website. Around 6000 items have been digitized and are now available from the website as downloads. As funding allows, we will work toward making the whole collection available.<br/><a href="https://christopher-alexander-ces-archive.org/">https://christopher-alexander-ces-archive.org/</a>
