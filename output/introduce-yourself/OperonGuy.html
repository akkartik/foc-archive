Hi there! I'm Tuomas, and the author of <a href="http://Operon.io">Operon.io</a> -language. I have played with different programming languages for 30+ years, and felt that the existing languages don't work as I would like them to work, on the real life problems related on my field of integration. I created the initial website for the project, as a starting point for the release process (<a href="http://operon.io">http://operon.io</a>). I haven't yet released the binaries and most of the documentation is yet to be written :grin: I joined here as I felt the purpose of this community is aligned with my mission. I hope to share my thoughts with you, reach some of you to both give and receive feedback. After the project is mature enough I will start to reach out for larger audience. Cheers! :smile:
