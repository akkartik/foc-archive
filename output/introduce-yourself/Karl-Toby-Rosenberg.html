Hi everyone, I’m Karl. I got into programming in the first place playing visual programming-esque games like LittleBigPlanet as a kid. I love playful and creative interactions for storytelling, teaching, etc.<br/><br/>For more context in the present, I’m a recent Ph.D. graduate from New York University, and I focused on human-computer interaction exploring how we could combine natural creativity, communication, and programming into an interactive communication medium of its own, in a sense. The specific project I did towards that exploration is <a href="https://ktrosenberg.github.io/drawtalking/">DrawTalking (Building Interactive Worlds by Sketching and Speaking),</a> and I’d love to share it here. It’s both my thesis and my playground for coming up with ideas.<br/><br/>Also, I’m really hoping to meet people here! I’m looking forward to conversations and even meet-ups if there are people in the NYC area or nearby. Nice to meet you all in advance!
