Hello! I stumbled across the podcast recently and have been working my way through the back catalog -- been totally blown away, tons of material I've never scratched the surface of. I studied music tech in school, so have spent a lot of time getting jaded about the Max/MSP workflow, and was very excited to see the discussion of broader approaches to graphical programming because I kind of wrote the whole thing off for a while there. I'm big on NixOS and functional programming and other stuff. Also was excited to see the Alberta representation, I'm in Edmonton!
