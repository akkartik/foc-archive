Trying to properly learn codemirror 6. I upgraded my AI with code <a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/robocoop-2">search</a> and optimised its prompt with <a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/gepa">GEPA</a> so it could help me program codemirror better. Given Observable is going plain Javascript, that simplifies things a bit language-wise and its just a matter of getting the off-the-shelf JS language syntax highlight working + injecting runtime state for code completion based on the current state of the runtime. My new <a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/runtime-variable-editor">prototype</a> runtime editor lets you change the runtime graph using the plain JS SDK instead of the higher level cell model. Anyway, nice to start understanding about 3% of codemirror's programming model. I think getting rid of cells will make things more straight forward.
