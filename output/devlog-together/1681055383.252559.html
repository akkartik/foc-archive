Update on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/driver.love">https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/driver.love</a>, my live-editing environment. It's still extremely easy (1% for me, 10% for others?) to crash the driver, so I've been trying to track down thoses corner cases. Realization: my memory of such crashes and instinct for situations causing crashes is extremely unreliable. Possibly the app's error behavior is changing under me during seemingly unrelated changes. I've been spinning my wheels on this for a couple of weeks. Hopefully it'll clarify over time. I might need a more elaborate set of tests that involve configuring a client app just so.
