I'm developing this idea about a homoiconic language that is encoded in a graph (no text required).<br/>This idea looks so beautiful, and so obvious, that I expected that it's already well developed in academia.<br/>I googled for papers, and didn't found much.<br/><br/>Do you know any related projects or papers?<br/>Do you think it's worth writing about, putting it in the form of academic paper?<br/>If so, where it could be published, given that paper is good and I don't have academic background?<br/><br/>I want to start academic career eventually. This could be a first step.<br/><br/>PS: I know that <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nikolas Martens</span> works on something related, but different.

Some interesting mathy work is being done with graphs and diagram based languages recently <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/05/19/circuits-bond-graphs-and-signal-flow-diagrams/">https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/05/19/circuits-bon&hellip;</a>.

Here's a fairly accessible blog that would give you a feel for this kind of thing <a href="https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/">https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/</a>.

I'm definitely interested in learning about the details of what you are thinking about. I'm not in academia so can't give advice on writing/publishing papers, unfortunately. But even if you publish a blog style write-up, it can be useful in getting good feedback.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Shalabh</span><br/>&gt; I'm definitely interested in learning about the details of what you are thinking about.<br/><br/>The idea is simple:<br/><br/>We need to store code somewhere, to be able reference it, do fine-grained versioning, link data to exact version of code, exact place in code, etc. Many wonderful features require code to be stored and referenced. So we need to store code in some kind of data structure. Looking at ipfs and git we may come to conclusion that DAG might be that kind of data structure.<br/><br/>DAG is a directed acyclic graph. Each node has body, and number of links with keys to other nodes.<br/><br/>DAG is so expressive, that it can represent many other datatypes: list, set, dictionary. If so, we can use it as the only compound datatype in language for now, it simplifies everything greatly. So you have functions, that accept single DAG argument and return a DAG. Keyed links serve as named arguments in other languages.<br/><br/>Next thing is pattern matching, through which you gonna do branching. Just like you have patterns for lists and dicts, it's possible to define pattern for a DAG. Something like that: {Value, key1: Node1, VariableKey =&gt; Node2 | RestLinks}. You may add guards to these patterns.<br/><br/>Then find a way to encode that kind of patterns and functions into DAG itself.<br/>This way you get nice pure language that is reminds lisp a bit, due it's homoiconicy.<br/><br/>I haven't fully decided how IO gonna look like.<br/>I like the idea of putting code inside actors (just like Erlang).<br/>Spliting all code into statements: send, receive, spawn, loop, return, match, dirty-call;<br/>Expressions: pure-call, compose (the opposite of pattern deconstruction).
