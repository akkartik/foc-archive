Hello Everybody!<br/><br/>So this is me:<br/>    <tt>1984</tt>     :star: Born. <em>[include events before this?]</em><br/>    <tt>1995</tt>     :technologist: BASIC &amp; HTML.<br/>    <tt>2000</tt>     :hankey: Server-side web (&amp; city life).<br/> <tt>2006-2011</tt>   :briefcase: Coder employee + Agile &amp; alcohol.<br/>    <tt>2011</tt>     :cat2: Left to freelance &amp; build iPad Twister for kittens etc.<br/>    <tt>2012</tt>    :dizzy_face: Lost my way.<br/>    <tt>2013</tt>    :rainbow: Looked in India, Nepal &amp; Berlin.<br/>    <tt>2014</tt>    :mortar_board: <em>"Never again software!"</em> tried misc., including ~homelessness.<br/>    <tt>2014</tt>    :chains: Software consulting.<br/> <tt>2016-2021</tt>  :money_with_wings: Startups &amp; drukqs.<br/>    <tt>2020</tt>    :tired_face: Burnout &amp; :deciduous_tree: countryside (again).<br/>    <tt>2023</tt>    :globe_with_meridians: Joined K-Web (as curator), next trying to revive the vision...<br/>    <tt>2023</tt>    :heart: My daughter baby Scout!!<br/>    <tt>2024</tt>     :mouse2: K-Web → Engelbart et al etc... (&amp; <tt>void systems</tt> see below).<br/><br/>...and that (researching Engelbart for James Burke's Knowledge Web) is how I found this slack!<br/><br/><b>A few books, videos etc that affected my worldview:</b><br/><br/> <tt>~2005</tt>   :film_projector: James Burke's docu series...<br/> <tt>~2008</tt>   :books: Read Don't Make Me Think → usability/UX fundamentalist.<br/> <tt>~2010</tt>   :performing_arts: Hans Rosling (live).<br/> <tt>~2012</tt>   :shinto_shrine: Bret Victor, Inventing on Principle.<br/> <tt>~2014</tt>   :orangutan: Sapiens.<br/><tt>later</tt>    :scroll: Big History (David Christian &amp; friends) :boom: The Dawn of Everything<br/><tt>earlier</tt> :person_in_lotus_position: Mindfulness meditation...<br/><br/>Despite agile, startups &amp; mental health issues, I'm doing okay. Sort of :zany_face:<br/>BTW, I live close to Gothenburg, Sweden.<br/><br/><b>My ~2 FoC projects:</b><br/><br/>• :globe_with_meridians: <b>The Knowledge Webs</b>, an epic project / family of projects originally envisioned by James Burke in the 1990s. It is a bit like a visual immersive Wikipedia (focusing on the connections), originally with 4 or more "tools": timeline, globe/map network graphs &amp; text + hypermedia. We currently suck at describing the visions, most recent attempt: <a href="https://github.com/knowledge-web/">GitHub</a> ...this was a rather narrow vision from last year, outdated &amp; since abandoned / superseded. Older but more comprehensive vision descriptions can be found on YouTube (the "prequel" documentary series Connections (1978) can also be found there or <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a>).<br/>    ◦ Also exploring a Dynamicland inspired interface (including battery powered wireless standalone dials, sliders etc).<br/>• :doughnut: <b>Void Systems</b> — Web apps (/ PWAs + electron logger/launcher) rebuilding &amp; reclaiming my own computing experience 2 min at a time from within itself (mobile usually)... think I'll have to explain / show this stuff another time... feel like this introduction has all been a little bit too much &amp; too rambling already.<br/>I'm sorry for this entrance.<br/>Anyways, looking forward to know &amp; explore with (some of) you! :smiley:
