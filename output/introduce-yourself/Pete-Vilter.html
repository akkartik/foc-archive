Hi folks! I'm Pete. My background is as a fullstack developer, but I've become very interested in databases, since a lot of fullstack app development comes down to loading and saving data from the DB. I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/vilterp/treesql">https://github.com/vilterp/treesql</a>, a database which has GraphQL-inspired tree-structured queries, and pushes out updates to those queries when the underlying data changes.<br/><br/>I work at <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/">https://www.cockroachlabs.com/</a>, where I'm learning the craft of database architecture from some of the greats. A few years ago, I also made some contributions to the Elm time-travelling debugger (<a href="https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-reactor/pull/115">https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-reactor/pull/115</a>), so I have a soft spot for that project :slightly_smiling_face:
