Still just ruminating in public, but I swear there is an actual compiler taking shape - <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/ruminating-about-mutable-value-semantics">https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/ruminating-about-&hellip;</a>

Some random thoughts. If your only representation for data is a byte string, then things work out ok, unless you want first class functions, coz now your function definitions have to be expressed in assembly packed into memory and I guess that would have to be your source code.<br/><br/>Even jsut sticking to classic data like JSON and pointers, the byte representation flattens what is intuitively logically hierarchical.<br/><br/>the cycle problem you mention is the mismatch between flat memory and a heirarchical logical representation that permits cycles. There is no 1-1 mapping between a DAG and a flat representation, but there are 1-n where the ambiguity is where you break the pointers.<br/><br/>At work we use pickle and later upgraded to <a href="https://pypi.org/project/dill/">dill</a> for serializing runtime graphs. For python it seems like a super hard problem given dynamic function definitions and the interpretability but I guess you have closed off some of that if its a compiled language.
