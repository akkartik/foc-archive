I think it correctly pictures the spirit of this community.\n\nI like this rule about excessive self-promotion. Sometimes it gets really irritating and it seems that it doesn't help with the main goal of the community.\n\nHowever there are things that I found disturbing:\n\n&gt; We encourage you to\n&gt; Discuss politics, economics, class, representation, intersectionality, social movements and dynamics, and other related maters.\n&gt; \nIs this really necessary? When people talk politics they get very divisive. When they get divisive, they don't work well together.\n\nVery list of topics already implies left-wing worldview (representation, intersectionality), which is already divisive. What if there are some very supportive and insightful members who have right-wing or conservative views? What if these left vs right wing discussions would develop here on FoC? I suspect it would divide people even more and make cooperation harder.\n\nI suggest to require in CoC to keep discussions about politics outside of community-affiliated spaces.\n\n&gt; amplify the influence of historically underrepresented people in shaping its future\n&gt; \nAgain, this sounds like a political goal for left-wing group. This very idea of \"underrepresentation\" is specifically left-wing thing, that is not shared by people with other political stances.\n\nI suggest to not use that kind of politicized language in CoC and keep it politically neutral.\n\n&gt; Delete posts or messages without notice.\n&gt; \nThis leaves interpretation what is hate and what is not, what is welcome and what is not to a very small circle of people, moderators. Even good people are limited and have flaws.\n\nI suggest to use that kind of power openly and publicly. Would be great if we had special channel where all bad posts are forwarded, where public could see how CoC principles are applied.\n\nThis is good for moderators too, since this way they can share responsibility with other members. Make this burden of power lighter.\n\n&gt; We have zero tolerance for people who commit acts of harassment, hate speech, or abuse anywhere, whether inside or outside the community.\n&gt; \nI have two concerns.\n\n1) Very hard to define what is harassment, hate speech and what is not. Internet is huge and contains diverse groups of people. So diverse, that a lot of statements that are perfectly fine for most of the people might be considered as very offensive by others. Imagine talking about Big Bang to creationists for example.Meaning of terms hate speech and harassment is subjective. It unreliable to use these terms for establishing code of conduct.\nI suggest to refrain from such vague terms as hate speech and harassment. Instead I suggest to define unwelcome behavior in terms that are more specific and are less subjective: use of curse words, doxing, unwanted texting, calls to violence, threats, name calling, etc.\n\n2) Why behavior outside of community-affiliated spaces is taken into account? If person does not disturb work inside the community, but acts imperfectly outside -- why this should this person be removed?\n\nEven good people have flaws. Every person at least once in his life acted indecently. People *will* act incorrectly, because they are limited. I think this should not affect the work inside the community. I think that we should remove people from the community only when it is absolutely necessary.\n\nI suggest to apply any measures towards members only based on their behavior inside community-affiliated spaces.\n\n---------------------\n\nIn general, I suggest to align principles in code of conduct around single goal that was beautifully formulated in the first paragraph:",
