I don't think you get the same kind of outcomes through remote collaboration (not until we have robust AR telepresence anyway). There's something irreplaceable about a whiteboard meeting. And as far as jobs go, I think the idea is that this <b>would</b> be your job (questions about financing aside). I already have enough trouble dedicating significant time to work on FoC when I'm employed just 2-3 days a week atm. There are just too many distractions throughout a typical week, and escaping to some Tuscan villa in the middle of nowhere is the means to solve that.
