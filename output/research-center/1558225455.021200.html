Remote: I've been following the WebGPU project, which is an ambitious open source collaboration between people from Google, Mozilla, Microsoft and Apple. No single corporation is "in charge". They are geographically distributed, communicating via github, email, etc, but they have weekly video/voice conferences, and less frequent face-to-face meetings. That's probably a common model. (Rust is a pretty successful language project. Did they use a similar model?)

The WebGPU team contains sub-teams from the same company though. So it's not 100% remote collaboration, it's more like a team with multiple offices. Rust is (or was) mostly driven by Mozillians who work at the same HQ.

And these cases prove that remote collaboration can "work", but we already knew that (many companies do it). This doesn't provide any evidence that one approach is <b>more effective</b> than the other.

And the work on WebGPU is like very technical and concrete: standardizing some already working concepts to work in the existing browsers using GPU existing capacities. It is mainly a work on compromise between major web actors. It is very different than work on somithing vague like "the future of coding", with all kinds of ideas popping up here and there that need to be managed to produce some concrete and useable outputs. I don't say remote won't work, sucessful remote work for WebGPU team don't mean it is transposable to our case.
