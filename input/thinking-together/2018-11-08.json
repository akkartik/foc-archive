I wrote some incredible macros that would sort data at compile time to be cache friendly but that also meant anyone who wanted to use my code had to understand my macros. Maybe that's not fair since to use anything you have to understand it but it just got me wondering, like I know I feel more productive in JavaScript (usually) than say C# but I think that's probably because I'm writing relatively small things that are all in my head. As soon as I was on a team I'd want a typed language since it would help spread the knowledge of how things work?\n\nSmalltalk often mentions the entire environment is written in smalltalk and modifiable live. That sounds great for experimenting but horrible for every day use. Imaging running `stpm` (smalltalk package manager) and having no idea how much of your environment was just modified.\n\nTo make this topic too big, have any of you written an algorithm in a visual programming environment? For example A* or some rectangle packing algorithm.\n\nAnyway, just curious if you know papers on why not lisp, why not smalltalk, why not VLPs, why not haskell, etc..",

I wrote some incredible macros that would sort data at compile time to be cache friendly but that also meant anyone who wanted to use my code had to understand my macros. Maybe that's not fair since to use anything you have to understand it but it just got me wondering, like I know I feel more productive in JavaScript (usually) than say C# but I think that's probably because I'm writing relatively small things that are all in my head. As soon as I was on a team I'd want a typed language since it would help spread the knowledge of how things work?\n\nSmalltalk often mentions the entire environment is written in smalltalk and modifiable live. That sounds great for experimenting but horrible for every day use. Imaging running "
