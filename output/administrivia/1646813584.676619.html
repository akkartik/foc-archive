[this is no biggie, and I must suppose that only I have this problem?]<br/><b>No matter how much I try reform my mind</b>, I keep thinking that #present-company is a channel for <em>presenting your company</em>, startup etc. But then when I re-read the description, the channel is about some metaphorical meaning instead. I think this is an example of the problems of learnability/memorability that arise when the literal meaning is plausible (at least for non-native me!) but the metaphorical meaning is the intended! :slightly_smiling_face:

Your read on the name isn't wrong. If you have a job you want to advertise, that's the channel. If you launch a startup and want to share the news, that's the channel.

It's meant to be a general catch-all for discussion that isn't on any particular topic covered by another channel. It's the "general" or "random". The reason we don't have a "general" or "random" is that when we did, people couldn't tell what those channels were for (or not for) either.

Naming is hard. There's no name that'll capture the plurality of meanings needed for a "general" channel for a small community like ours. That said, if you can think of a better name (that's not "general" or "random" or "off-topic" etc), let me know and I'll seriously consider it!

But you're being a bit disingenuous, Ivan. I assume the "company" in "present company" is a playful touch alluding to "present company excepted" (or other similar phrases). So it's a convenient coincidence that "talking about your company" happens to be under the broader category of "present company".<br/><br/>The name doesn't trouble me, but just to throw ideas around: Would "present-of-coding" be any clearer? (Without entirely losing a touch of silliness?)

(Ooo I just saw replies below. But I won't feel bad for being redundant with them, because I did the <em>proper</em> thing and replied on the thread.)

Apologies if I seemed disingenuous. The name was arrived at as part of a huge thread a few years ago that considered a ton of alternatives. The multiple interpretations are deliberate and why the name was chosen.<br/>• Yes, it's a playful pun on sayings of the form "present company <em></em>___"<br/>• It is meant to imply <em>discussion about the present of programming</em> as opposed to the future of programming.<br/>• The <em>this is a place to talk about your company</em> meaning was also known and intended at the time the name was picked, so that we wouldn't need a separate channel for job listings, startup news, etc.<br/>There was probably more playful [re/mis]interpretation done by various folks at the time, but it's escaped my memory.

In the past, we'd occasionally get someone asking for a #jobs or #hiring or #startups or #business channel. A dedicated channel for #jobs or whatever would be too low-volume for a small community like ours. I'd reply that #random was the place for that — but the goofiness of #random made it awkward (to the best of my recollection; there might have been other failings of #random for this purpose, too).<br/><br/>So when we picked the new channel names, #present-company was specifically intended to be that channel.

#present-of-coding is a fine name. I recall it coming up, and not being chosen, but the details escape me.
