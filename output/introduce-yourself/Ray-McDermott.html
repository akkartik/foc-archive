TIL and it feels like a good place. I make a podcast about Clojure (defn) and have a panel based YouTube channel about coding in Clojure (apropos clojure). My hope for the future was rekindled after I first saw Brett Victor's talk Inventing on Principle. I am in the midst of a project (repl-repl) to perform collaborative live coding in Clojure ... it had stalled for a while but various things have pushed me back into action, including the work that NextJournal have done with CodeMirror v6. I am interested in the mechanics of programming as you can tell but also the effect of programming on the society at large. I don't know if this is the right place to have these conversations but I'm here for it if it is.
