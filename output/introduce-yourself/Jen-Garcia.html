Hi everyone, I'm Jen. I'm originally from Puerto Rico, but currently based in Atlanta, Georgia. I started my career in software after teaching myself Javascript to help with repetitive tasks at my animation studio job. I think I was able to pick it up quickly because a decade before that, Geocities, MySpace, and Neopets had taught me to not be afraid of code-looking-things. I feel like there aren't many spaces like that anymore, so programmers are treated like wizards rather than fellow craftspeople. I would love to help create something that could facilitate art-making and leave the busywork to computers.
