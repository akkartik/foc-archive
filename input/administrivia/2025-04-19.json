I'm struck so far that they are really oriented around design, the future of human-computer interaction and the ideas around effective learning and teaching in a technologically-advanced world, not necessarily the practice of coding and computing. So why is FoC called Future of Coding?\n\n*Why does it matter?*\nI listened to '_A Case for Feminism in Programming Language Design_' by Felienne Hermans and the corresponding FoC podcast - both changed my world. Reading the responses on here were really interesting and there was also expressed interested in increasing the number of people-oriented creators of things, qualitative and feminine voices in this community.\n\n*In support*\n• Could the name FoC be self-selecting? Maybe these target perspectives might be attracted to the community if 'Coding' didn't appear as the true focus, but 'Human-Computer Interaction' or 'Design Engineering'?\n• Now, eeeeek, but do we like 'Coding' because it's hard, whereas 'Design' and 'HCI' don't have the same respected-because-they're-highly-technical connotations? (This is something I've reconciled myself since listening to Felienne's talk. I've called myself a Software Engineer for a long time, instead of what I am, what I trained in and what work I actually prefer, which is Design Engineer.)\n• When we say 'Future of Coding' is that actually why we're all here and what we're interested in? Maybe not! Most of the people in this community can probably code and it's probably how they found FoC, but do we want that to be the common theme of everyone here or are we interested in more designers and other people with interesting perspectives on the Future of \"?\" who can't code?\n*In defence*\n• 'Coding' is an important distinction, as it focuses on exploration and the making of things, rather than 'Code' which focuses on Computer Science. Maybe the interest of this community is _applying_ these ideas through code and therefore 'Coding' is an appropriate word.\n• Have I misunderstood what Future of Coding is about?\n• If it was called something more about HCI and Design or Design Engineering, would a lot of people feel less connected to this community? Many people who identify with _code_ and who have found FoC might not identify with _design_, even if a fair amount of the conversation and interest here is already around design. It would be a shame to lose or disconnect so many interesting projects and people from this community.\n• Bret Victor and Alan Kay mostly appear to present to coders, maybe 'Future of Coding' does attract the most appropriate audience, as it's their target audience.\n• Can a name ever capture everything? Future of Coding is also a good name!\n• Maybe this is all too in the weeds and communicating the communities interests through it's outputs like social media, Meetups and Slack is most important.\n• Maybe the problem is my internalised ideas as an individual, rather than the name of a community.
