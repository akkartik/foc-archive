That would mean everything the computer does MUST follow same Interface Guidelines™, which I agree is nice for users, but also implies program authors can't experiment with unusual interfaces.

It didn't go very far though, got optimized for app devs over user agency + automation and now is pretty much a regular OS (exhibit: Chromebooks).",
