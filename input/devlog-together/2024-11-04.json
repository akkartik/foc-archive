For now its not offline-first, but it does annoy me as those CDN downloads are what's preventing me getting to single digit millis startup time and fully working offline. I could fix this with a service worker, but then doesn't work with `file:\/\/` origins, and I think the simplicity of the single file double click ``file:\/\/`` execution wins. Maybe there is another way :thinking_face:\nAnyway, for me the MVP is\n• reliable exporting to a single file\n• bundled userspace editor so you can continue editing within the notebook in the replicas\nIf those two things are in place then we can decouple from Observable and the other stuff like notebook state serialization and trying to make it offline-first can come later. First those two before I get too excited though. Still quite a lot of stuff to iron out.",
