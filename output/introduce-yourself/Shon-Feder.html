Hi! I was recommended the podcast a couple years back, and have enjoyed several episodes a lot.<br/><br/>More recently, I was recommended to check out the slack in conversation with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Eric Gade</span> and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Daniel Krasner</span> (thanks for the recommendation :slightly_smiling_face:).<br/><br/>My principle interests for the last while have been:<br/><br/>• Philosophy of communication and community<br/>• PLT, especially in relation to the above, and in relation to philosophy of logic and logical foundations, and with a soft spot for logic programming. The kinds of transformation in programming I'm keen on go in hand-in-hand with fundamental insights into logic, ontology, and communication (as the medium of community).<br/>• Cooperativism, the social and solidarity economy, and (left) utopian political prefiguration more generally<br/>That said, my activities are often not much beyond dabbling in this or that.<br/>Outside of work, most of my programming is the OCaml ecosystem.<br/><br/>Happy to be here and I look forward to learning from the conversations.
