Alan Kay talk ‘Is it really "Complex"? Or did we just make it "Complicated”?’. The talk was given some 9 years ago, but, this is the first time that I’ve seen it:<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubaX1Smg6pY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubaX1Smg6pY</a><br/><br/>My highlights:<br/><br/>51:21 suppressing the present to see different ways to address the future<br/>51:35 “semaphore” is a “bad idea”, pseudo-time is superior, but never got used over last 30 years<br/>54:10 Nile Graphics Language by Dan Amelang is a dataflow language and is very small.

It's an option/choice to dump notes/summaries in here. Another seems to have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609113912/http://alan-kay.wikia.com/wiki/Alan_Kay_Wiki">https://web.archive.org/web/20160609113912/http://alan-kay.w&hellip;</a> but the guy took it into a private/closed Notion. Good for us that the Wikia content is under CC BY-SA 3.0 if anyone would bother to rescue/revive this material. Another one would be <a href="https://gitlab.com/AndreasS/andreass.gitlab.io/-/blob/master/public/zk/AlanKay.md">https://gitlab.com/AndreasS/andreass.gitlab.io/-/blob/master&hellip;</a> by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andreas S.</span> but from what I understand, he's firmly in the PKM and Zettelkasten camp of personal note-taking only, nothing done about libre-free licensing or doing something with other people's notes, and too his are sometimes rather vague (the other half in wet memory). Then mine <a href="https://hypertext-systems.org/vpri3/entry.php?type-source-id=1&type-target-id=2">https://hypertext-systems.org/vpri3/entry.php?type-source-id=1&type-target-id=2</a> was to collect notes to then later hopefully extract main Kay points, as these are unfortunately scattered and repeated across many talks. Potentially eventually editorialized towards canonicalization. To avoid/replace the junk YouTube comment system. Obviously, evidently, naturally, no interest in this kind of thing, so everybody keep scattering many comments/discussions in many places.

I’m open to share my notes. Maybe even with licences stuff. But I’m still convinced that context matters. That means if I just “share” my notes the potential for misunderstanding is great…

Yes, sure. Personal note-taking records and relies on individual personal context. Every other person has a different personal context (and not yours, not Paul's, not mine. not Alan's either). Sharing the personal context is less useful for the reader/recipient than shared context, as it does not translate over to someone else (as from the sender it's left out and implicit and may be situational and/or off-topic, of which the receiver has a different bag of his/hers, not shared). Simple, obvious, right? So if the model/practice is personal note-taking, and many people dump their comments, there's not much benefit collecting that, in comparison to general discussion towards canonicality. Sharing personal notes (just meaning, these are published) does not help much, other people do not share the personal context. So I guess the idea here is that everyone watches Alan's video, each take his/her own notes, and these are not much useful for the next viewer (till everyone has seen all videos and has personal ideas in the head or personal notes externalized). Question is, why even post these. At best, it's a personal reminder only.
