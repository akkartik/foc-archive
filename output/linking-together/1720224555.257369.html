We get a lot of speculative and experimental thoughts here which is the reason we all engage, but who amongst you can say you are 110% certain you've found what you believe to be the Future, with the uncertainty <em>only</em> being in "whenever that comes about"? Which  of course, as the Twitter thread mentions, is about the seemingly trivial but of course 110% important factor of "memeing" to the Internet. Personally, I'm crap at that bit.

I started off my reply by disagreeing with this: "If a meme which encases your perspective cannot be replicated to even one other person over the web, then it's done, that won't exist in the future. Failed meme."

Bias statement: I am not good at certainty, no matter which topic.<br/><br/>That said, I am particuarly reluctant to attribute any certainty to ideas about the future of programming because that future will be determined by lots of forces: technical, social, political, environmental, etc. Unless you are considering the very near future (say, five years from now), I find it hard to be certain about anything.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span> I’m just trying to be funny and thought throwing a reference to Dunning-Kruger (in meme-form!) into this thread would provide some… entertainment.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span> demonstrates it well. The people I know who are brilliant at what they do and have all the competency to be confident about, would never claim that they are certain about anything. And from my own experience I can only say that I’m beginning to understand how you get more and more uncertain, the deeper you dig and the more you realize how much more there is you don’t know enough about.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tom Lieber</span> Look, what do I know? I have no idea what you’re working on. Any of us could potentially make some commit to GitHub tomorrow and change the world. If you feel confident that you’re on a good path, then good for you. And I see no reason why you couldn’t have put all the effort in to have made it way past the slope of enlightenment. <br/><br/>Just thought it would be useful to be aware of this effect, not necessarily to place yourself on that diagram (which technically isn’t correctly representing the actual theory; that’s why I called it meme), but to realize how confidence may come across to other people familiar with it.<br/><br/>Could I have gotten this across in a better way? For sure. <br/>I apologize for my tasteless attempt to make this point.

Me too! And I’d like to think that these statements are less about shapes of things to chase for and more about values people here already have and share. No future predictions needed.<br/><br/>You value moldable programming environments? Me too. You believe accessibility is important? Me too. You think games are getting some things right? Me too. We already share those beliefs. Here. Today.<br/><br/>Not everything has to be looked at as <em>results</em> we want to achieve. Sometimes it’s good to share values and explore from there. Enjoying the <em>process</em>. Together.

I'm certain that the Future of (Programming!) will have a plurality of approaches. I'm certain that something like what I'm working on (#allinonnodeandwire) belongs in the pantheon but there's so much more work to do on it to make it good-ish! I'm certain that to invest the necessary long-term effort in improving it, we must convince ourselves that it's "commercially viable" (in quotes because see #thinking-together giant thread on personal manifestos for convivial economics)

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span> The firm beliefs I have often prevent me from seeing a deeper truth. The brain is good at tricking itself into thinking it’s right about what it knows to be the truth, and this is actually useful!  We need to believe 110% that a stick in the grass is a snake, in order to keep us alive the 10% of the time it is actually a snake that will bite us.  Knowing this, I try to keep open the possibility that everything I believe in any given moment may not be totally accurate.  All I really know for sure is that “knowing” is a state of mind that has a very strong grip at times, and loosening that grip tends to be helpful to me getting more of what I want.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jim Kring</span> Hi! I think there are actually at least two quite distinct levels of this space, for me at least, where one level carries the 110% certainty and stability that I've been talking about, and the other changes literally on a weekly or two-weekly basis and represents insane levels of volatility! This is my life.<br/><br/>To bring that down to an example without talking about my own work, imagine you're TBL and have invented the Web. You carry through your life this vision and mental model of a single global fabric of interconnected human knowledge. Nothing can shake that from you or upset your 110% belief in the value of that.<br/><br/>But do you just start by implementing a contacts database for CERN? Do you integrate with FTP this week, but move on to 2D graphics the next? Why would anyone need 2D when 1D text is universal? Ah, but here's SGML, and here's SMTP and MIME media types, and shouldn't there be some object method stuff in there that's all the trend these days? NeXT seems cool. Everyone should be able to edit web pages!
