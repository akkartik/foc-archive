I know some quantum computing from Michael Nielsen's and Andy Matuschak's mnuemonic medium pieces, and I agree it would be neat to be able to really visualize everything. I'm surprised you can visualize quantum states with the bloch sphere because that throws away all of the phase information. Does that have anything to do with using spacetime algebra to represent entangled qubits?",
