Improved the handling of excel-like datagrids.. you can now sum or avg a column and\/or use it in a (pie) chart.. offcourse cell ranges are also possible. I wanted to prepare a video this week, have been doing some test runs again with obs, but I am not happy yet with the results so a little bit of patient still needed :-)\n\nIn the meantime, hopefully the screenshots show some of the progress and working of the system.. you can also see the changing of the state of the condition node depending on the input.. although this is better shown in a video offcourse..
