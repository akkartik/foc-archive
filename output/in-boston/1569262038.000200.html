What if software were Different? From Applications to Computational Media.<br/>Seminar Series: HCI Seminar Series 2019<br/><br/>Speaker: Clemens Nylandsted Klokmose<br/><br/>Speaker Affiliation: Aarhus University<br/><br/>Host: Arvind Satyanarayan<br/><br/>Date: Tuesday, October 01, 2019<br/><br/>Time: 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM<br/><br/>Location: Kiva Room (32-G449)<br/><br/>Abstract:<br/>The concept of applications is ubiquitous and completely taken for granted in modern computing. Software doesn’t have to be synonymous with applications, and there is great potential to be unlocked if we break out of them. In this talk, I will argue for a renewed focus on developing computational media and show efforts we have undertaken to demonstrate how software can be made differently. I will, among other things, present our work on Webstrates (<a href="http://webstrates.net">webstrates.net</a>), its authoring environment<br/>Codestrates (<a href="http://codestrates.org">codestrates.org</a>), and a data visualization environment built using these called Vistrates (<a href="http://vistrates.org">vistrates.org</a>).<br/><br/>Bio:<br/>Clemens Nylandsted Klokmose is an associate professor in the Department of Digital Design and Information Studies at Aarhus University. Clemens has worked as a postdoc at Computer Science, Aarhus University and at Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique, Université Paris-Sud. He has furthermore spent a year as a user interface specialist in the software industry.<br/>Clemens received his PhD in Computer Science in 2009 from Aarhus University supervised by prof. Susanne Bødker.<br/>Clemens’ main interest is the fundamentals of interactive computing, particularly to support and understanding computing with multiple devices and multiple people. Many of his ideas are crystallised into the Webstrates platform (<a href="http://webstrates.net">webstrates.net</a>), which he leads the development of.
