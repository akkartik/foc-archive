A neat example of that. At the beginning of Light Table, one of the original hackers from the 90's reached out because he thought what we were doing was really cool. I was shocked to learn he knew very little about programming, but simply exploited the fact that most systems back then were written in such a way that the absence of an error was equivalent to success. So they found ways to make it to the next "step" without errors and so were granted access to things they shouldn't have been.
