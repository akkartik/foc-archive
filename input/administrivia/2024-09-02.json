The way we use it, it sits in a unique spot in the space, something between a forum and a chat.\n\n* The medium\/format of Slack, plus our cultural norms, encourage people to make substantial posts which then foster lively discussion. It feels like a forum.\n* Everyone see new posts instantaneously; heck, you even see typing indicators and online\/away status. It feels like a chat.\n* When looking at the top-level of a channel, you see the full content of each message, with a count of replies. It feels like… a blog index?\n\nThere's WYSIWYG text editing, unobtrusive persistence of drafts, polished clients for every platform. The information hierarchy is clear: channel -> post -> reply. Slack is, by and large, rather nice.\n\nSlack is also an enterprise-bootlicking product suffering from continual "

The client is like an extravagant slice of cake — rich and thick to a fault. It's a service that runs over the internet, but it's not part of the web. It's not meaningfully extensible — there are \"bots\" and data exports, but they're basic and begrudging. It's siloed. It's proprietary. It's not the least bit malleable. Slack is antithetical to the ethos of this community. We champion the agency of individual people and wild experimentation. Slack, by design, opposes those.\n\nWith every alternative product I've explored, a few of these issues are addressed, but comparatively more of the nice qualities of Slack are absent.\n\nI use Discord all day every day. It's like Slack but slower (\"Installing updates 1 of 5\"), buggier, bloated with features and ads (\"Get Nitro\"). It also makes novel but awkward design choices. For instance, to start a thread of replies to a message, you must name the thread. That's a friction point. It allows some flexibility, in that you can start more than one thread for a single top-level post. But I'd argue that it is strictly worse than having a single linear thread (like Slack) or a single tree of replies (like a mailing list \/ forum). And besides, it's just as bad as Slack, or worse, in every way that presently pains us, except the boots being licked are gamer boots.\n\nThe organization behind Zulip is lovely. They're principled, self-sustaining without VC, focused on building a great product for their users. But, that product leans heavily into ephemeral chat, and suffers from a famously clunky user interface. Beyond just playing with the product, I spent some time in their Github (yay open source) looking at issues and discussions, and I don't see signs that they'll be able to fix the UI — it's hard for them to make even small styling changes, let alone restructure the information design.\n\nDiscourse is… fine. It's a little bit more chaotic, a little bit more clunky, a little bit more web-y, a little bit more bloated. It has way too much structure, with a visual hierarchy that doesn't map to the conceptual hierarchy. Like our Slack, it aims to be a hybrid of a forum and a chat, but it does that by offering both separately rather than synthesizing them into a compelling hybrid. If the community had started on Discourse, I think we'd be less unhappy with it than we are now with Slack, but I still think we'd be unhappy.\n\nBut the most charming alternative, and hands-down my favourite path forward… will take a bit of explaining.\n\nIt's the "

The way we use it, it sits in a unique spot in the space, something between a forum and a chat.\n\n* The medium\/format of Slack, plus our cultural norms, encourage people to make substantial posts which then foster lively discussion. It feels like a forum.\n* Everyone see new posts instantaneously; heck, you even see typing indicators and online\/away status. It feels like a chat.\n* When looking at the top-level of a channel, you see the full content of each message, with a count of replies. It feels like… a blog index?\n\nThere's WYSIWYG text editing, unobtrusive persistence of drafts, polished clients for every platform. The information hierarchy is clear: channel -&gt; post -&gt; reply. Slack is, by and large, rather nice.\n\nSlack is also an enterprise-bootlicking product suffering from continual <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Enshittification|enshittification>. They're holding our history hostage. There are effectively zero moderation tools. User signup is flaky. The client is like an extravagant slice of cake — rich and thick to a fault. It's a service that runs over the internet, but it's not part of the web. It's not meaningfully extensible — there are \"bots\" and data exports, but they're basic and begrudging. It's siloed. It's proprietary. It's not the least bit malleable. Slack is antithetical to the ethos of this community. We champion the agency of individual people and wild experimentation. Slack, by design, opposes those.\n\nWith every alternative product I've explored, a few of these issues are addressed, but comparatively more of the nice qualities of Slack are absent.\n\nI use Discord all day every day. It's like Slack but slower (\"Installing updates 1 of 5\"), buggier, bloated with features and ads (\"Get Nitro\"). It also makes novel but awkward design choices. For instance, to start a thread of replies to a message, you must name the thread. That's a friction point. It allows some flexibility, in that you can start more than one thread for a single top-level post. But I'd argue that it is strictly worse than having a single linear thread (like Slack) or a single tree of replies (like a mailing list \/ forum). And besides, it's just as bad as Slack, or worse, in every way that presently pains us, except the boots being licked are gamer boots.\n\nThe organization behind Zulip is lovely. They're principled, self-sustaining without VC, focused on building a great product for their users. But, that product leans heavily into ephemeral chat, and suffers from a famously clunky user interface. Beyond just playing with the product, I spent some time in their Github (yay open source) looking at issues and discussions, and I don't see signs that they'll be able to fix the UI — it's hard for them to make even small styling changes, let alone restructure the information design.\n\nDiscourse is… fine. It's a little bit more chaotic, a little bit more clunky, a little bit more web-y, a little bit more bloated. It has way too much structure, with a visual hierarchy that doesn't map to the conceptual hierarchy. Like our Slack, it aims to be a hybrid of a forum and a chat, but it does that by offering both separately rather than synthesizing them into a compelling hybrid. If the community had started on Discourse, I think we'd be less unhappy with it than we are now with Slack, but I still think we'd be unhappy.\n\nBut the most charming alternative, and hands-down my favourite path forward… will take a bit of explaining.\n\nIt's the <https:\/\/forum.merveilles.town\/|Merveilles forum>. It's brutally simple. Spartan! But it's tasteful. It's immaculate. Crucially, a member of the Merveilles community built and maintains the forum software, taking a decidedly <https:\/\/cblgh.org\/cerca\/|principled> approach. This forum is a reflection of the community it homes, because it was built by and for that community. (See where I'm going with this?)\n\nAll the off-the-shelf options — Zulip, Discourse, Mattermost, Discord, IRC, phpBB, Mastodon — they'd let us _get away_ from Slack. We could pick one that had some nice features. It'd be a pain in the butt to move, and a blast of fresh air to settle in. But even if we self-hosted, we'd still be held hostage — by _product design decisions_. Every one of these products and services makes a set of tradeoffs to satisfy as many customers as possible.
