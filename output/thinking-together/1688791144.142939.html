I know that it doesn't necessarily implement many of the points from the 'manifesto' and televisions are still attention sinks, but I always thought that the Samsung 'The Frame' TV was interesting because it move the centerpiece of the lounge from a big, cold, out-of-place television to an inquisitive wall of artwork until the user chooses that they want to watch television.

We have such a TV, which we bought because of its form factor rather than for the artwork feature. We didn't expect to use it initially. But of course we couldn't resist playing with it, and now we appreciate it for exactly the reason you cite.

If you don't mind me asking, what reaction do you get from visitors? Do they think of it as a piece of art or is it apparent that it is a TV?

We also have a frame, situated on a wall full of actual art/photos in similar frames, so we do use the art display mode on it. The driver was mostly to have it blend in and for the wall to look cohesive when not being used for tv, as opposed to just being a parking lot for a big device. When the light is just right, it really does look like just another art piece, but mostly you can tell it’s a screen, and other cues like it’s position relative to the sofa, being the largest frame on the wall, etc give it a way. No visitors have ever mistaken it for actual art

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Martin Shaw</span> Nobody ever mistook it for a piece of art. Comments are usually of the type "that's a nice way to use a TV".
