I'm excited to meet someone who worked at Intentional Software! I've watched videos of Charles Simonyi talk about links in code being stored as strong references, and about generative programming. I don't think think those concepts are foreign to this community, but I was very excited to see a real company (Intentional) formed around doing programming that way. I look forward to whatever insights you can find and provide in this community.

Stumbled upon Jim Coplien's work with DCI<br/>-&gt; He talks a lot about Alan Kay<br/>-&gt; became a fan of Alan Kay and found VPRI<br/>-&gt; subscribed to the VPRI mailing list<br/>-&gt; when the list was discontinued, many subscribers replied with disappointment and made our own projects known<br/>-&gt; I made the SomethingNew GitHub repo as a place to collaborate and catalog our ideas<br/>-&gt; people kept adding resources and links, and we started stumbling across other online collections and communities (like Ivan Reese's)<br/>-&gt; Eventually wound up here, but didn't do much and kept wandering and forgot about it<br/>-&gt; Eventually found Dark, and Ellen Chisa (CEO) referred me back to here<br/>-&gt; Discovered that many other individuals and groups I had come across previously (big names and small) and whom I never thought were connected or that I'd come across again ... Many of them are part of FOC, so I concluded that this is some nexus of it all and became active here

Hey, I've seen this before - I think listed on <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span>'s visual programming codex?<br/><br/>Anyway, that's a really neat visualization! Do you have any plans to allow "programming" to be done by direct interaction with such visualizations?

Welcome! Do you have any specific projects or goals in that space? If not, is anything specific you really like or that you see potential in?
