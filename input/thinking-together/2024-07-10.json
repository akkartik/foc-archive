But it does feel at times like waiting for Godot.\n\nI guess I'll go back to elaborate on my previous answer a little bit. That's not too off-topic here.\n\n>> ..what would you say makes [programming computers] difficult?\n> \n> 1. Incentives\n> 2. Dependencies\nIncentives: the computer industry arose out of a world war and early computers were huge and expensive things for countries or large organizations. That history still influences the industry. Our software was largely made in an industrial setting catering to the needs of companies. Making them easy to program is a low priority. Making them understandable to independent individuals on their personal computers is even lower priority.\n\nDependencies: most software depends on lots of other software. Little effort has been made to keep things parsimonious. All this adds to the difficulty for an individual wanting to program their own computer. You can't just learn to do one simple thing, it pulls in a bunch of other things that you are at risk of needing to find out about when everything breaks. In this environment it's natural that most people throw up their arms and look around for someone to just give them something readymade even if it's partly or very remotely what they want.\n\nThere are feedback loops between incentives and dependencies. Software has bloated dependencies because companies are able to hire people to care for them. Bloated dependencies perpetuate the way companies work and give them a reason for existence.\n\nThis is why I work on what I work on. As I said in my DM to you, my vision for the future of software is:\n• tools built atop a stable stack with infrequent upgrades,\n• built durably to seldom update themselves,\n• always providing source code and infrastructure for anyone who wants to modify them.\nDurability and minimizing upgrades seem like good practical tests for the dependency footprint of a piece of software.\n\nIf we ever get to a computer that requires learning a minimum of stuff to do something, we'll then be in a better position to tackle my third bullet: the intrinsic difficulty of programming for someone who doesn't seem to naturally enjoy it. But from where we are, it seems hard to even think about.\n\nYou're right that my plain-text software is toy-like. But we have to learn to walk before we can run. I don't think we'd be in any position to manage say Xanadu-like hypertext until we fix the foundations I've described above.\n\nThat's probably the essence of every disagreement in this forum and probably others: I think we all agree that all the problems everyone points out are problems. We just disagree about their relative priority.",

That history still influences the industry. Our software was largely made in an industrial setting catering to the needs of companies. Making them easy to program is a low priority. Making them understandable to independent individuals on their personal computers is even lower priority.\n\nDependencies: most software depends on lots of other software. Little effort has been made to keep things parsimonious. All this adds to the difficulty for an individual wanting to program their own computer. You can't just learn to do one simple thing, it pulls in a bunch of other things that you are at risk of needing to find out about when everything breaks. In this environment it's natural that most people throw up their arms and look around for someone to just give them something readymade even if it's partly or very remotely what they want.\n\nThere are feedback loops between incentives and dependencies. Software has bloated dependencies because companies are able to hire people to care for them. Bloated dependencies perpetuate the way companies work and give them a reason for existence.\n\nThis is why I work on what I work on. As I said in my DM to you, my vision for the future of software is:\n"

But from where we are, it seems hard to even think about.\n\nYou're right that my plain-text software is toy-like. But we have to learn to walk before we can run. I don't think we'd be in any position to manage say Xanadu-like hypertext until we fix the foundations I've described above.\n\nThat's probably the essence of every disagreement in this forum and probably others: I think we all agree that all the problems everyone points out are problems. We just disagree about their relative priority."
