Been reading a lot about Calm Tech (<a href="https://calmtech.com/">https://calmtech.com/</a>), technology designed to require a minimum of the user's repeated attention. Products/projects which make information available to the user on the user's request and not the other way around.<br/><br/>As someone who has wasted plenty of time on social media, I find the design ideas fleshed out on the site and related projects fascinating. Does anyone else have an interest? Seems like a positive (for once) way 'back to the future' of useful home-based tech.

I'm a big fan. I've tried to shift my mindset more into this space when building <a href="http://gnocchi.club">gnocchi.club</a>, especially relating to only providing features to help accomplish the task at hand as a contrast against the increasingly chaotic nature of most cooking sites (because of their reliance on ads and the engagement spiral).<br/><br/>It's still hard for me to think outside the box of traditional web apps, but mainly I tried to focus on trying to end up in a usable state no matter what when interpreting user actions, limiting notifications and re-engagement junk, and generally trying to be utilitarian and minimalist as a product by avoiding ambitious features.

Also a big fan! Happy to discuss the ideas. I think people are kind of trying to implement it in IOT but somehow missing the point.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Grant Forrest</span><br/><br/>I really love the design of Gnocchi!<br/>It is really simple while ensuring it is full of features useful to a clear and defined audience with specialised need.<br/>I also like the small animations on interactions.<br/><br/>As a technical person, it is difficult not to overthink features, bloating deadlines and delaying delivery of tools which people would find useful in a more basic state.<br/><br/>The quote "Release early, release often".<br/><br/>If you make any additions, please share them, I would like to see them.<br/><br/>Some books to recommend on this topic:<br/>Shape Up - Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters (<a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">https://basecamp.com/shapeup</a>)<br/>Insanely Simple: The Obsession That Drives Apple's Success (<a href="https://kensegall.com/books">https://kensegall.com/books</a>)

Aw, thanks! It's been a long journey to figuring out the right process to get things shipped. I still have anxiety when things aren't perfect but I love having a useful app in my hand regardless.
