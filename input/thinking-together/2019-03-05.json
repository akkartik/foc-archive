But some of the other efforts include a database in the language. Some languages will include a drawing system, some use a library like Red which has a  domain specific language for rendering. Others just dump you into CSS\/HTML\/JS type of drawing. I think this is the most important design decision in the language itself: will it have a database inside? will it include drawing?

Sharing of thoughts, obviously; but there are always the questions of personal careers, fame, money, status. All of those nasty cynical things yet which in the end make all the difference.\n\nSpecifically, I'm looking for what could we (our company) give and what could we potentially look for; to figure out how it could be worth our time to engage deeply and not just lurk and absorb any ideas?\n\nI'll expand on the context a bit. On one hand the thing we're building ticks (very) many of the boxes people are looking for here. This is why I'm opening my mouth now, actually. On the other hand we already 'have found the answers' for great many practical questions. So I feel like I couldn't sincerely participate in the high-level discussions which are based on \"let's try to figure things out together\", because, well, we've figured many things out already, committed to them, and are now going through the phase of actually implementing the stuff.\n\nI'll pick one concrete, central example: our language is javascript, enchanced with a transparent ORM to a global workspace of shared resources - powerful, familiar, but offers absolutely no chance for fundamental language design innovation. This would basically rule us out the interests of any people here for whom new language design is The Thing, The Reason To Be Here; maybe because they have a language research oriented academic career, maybe because of personal aspirations; maybe because this channel originates from a discussion group whose identity is new language design. And this is just one example, there are a lot of other similar ones.\n\nSo finally, the personal question: if I \"can't\" participate in discussions sincerely without being an advocate, and I \"can't\" just expect people to jump on-board of our existing train of answers, but I still genuinely believe we've what it takes to answer the core problems put forth here, what should I do?",

What is stopping you from participating in discussion? Is your only answer to every question going to be “you should see\/do what we’re doing”? I doubt that if you are a good listener and adviser!

                "text": "The object-capability model is a computer security model. A capability describes a transferable right to perform one (or more) operations on a given object. It can be obtained by the following combination:\n\nan unforgeable reference (in the sense of object references or protected pointers) that can be sent in messages.\na message that specifies the operation to be performed.The security model relies on not being able to forge references. \n\nObjects can interact only by sending messages on references.\nA reference can be obtained by:initial conditions: In the initial state of the computational world being described, object A may already have a reference to object B.\nparenthood: If A creates B, at that moment A obtains the only reference to the newly created B.\nendowment: If A creates B, B is born with that subset of A's references with which A chose to endow it.\nintroduction: If A has references to both B and C, A can send to B a message containing a reference to C. B can retain that reference for subsequent <http:\/\/use.In|use.In> the object-capability model, all computation is performed following the above rules.\nAdvantages that motivate object-oriented programming, such as encapsulation or information hiding, modularity, and separation of concerns, correspond to security goals such as least privilege and privilege separation in capability-based programming.\nThe object-capability model was first proposed by Jack Dennis and Earl C. Van Horn in 1966.",
