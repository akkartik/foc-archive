Hi folks! <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Krycho</span>â€™s message above reminds me that I've actually just been a lurker here for the past several weeks and haven't actually introduced myself yet! Lol<br/><br/>I'm an Ex-Googler/Ex-Amazonian that left work this past February to spend a year full time committing to my passion project, the <a href="http://clarolang.com">Claro programming language</a>! I'm ~3 years into development on the language, and in 2023 things have really accelerated and the language is at a place I'm very proud of (although it still is lacking in the way of documentation). If you're interested in checking out an early stage language with some very novel ideas about <a href="https://jasonsteving99.github.io/claro-lang/graph_procedures/graph_procedures.html">provably safe/efficient concurrency</a> and a powerful <a href="https://jasonsteving99.github.io/claro-lang/module_system.html">module system</a> and a sprinkling of <a href="https://github.com/JasonSteving99/claro-lang/tree/main/stdlib/utils/abstract_modules/example">compile-time "meta-programming" magic</a>, take a look!<br/><br/>I'll be working through Advent of Code in Claro this year, so if you'd like a taste of what that looks like: I'll be dumping my solutions <a href="https://github.com/JasonSteving99/claro-lang/tree/main/examples/claro_programs/advent_of_code_2023/">here</a>.
