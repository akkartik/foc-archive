I'm Damian,\n\nI'm a professional software developer and a non-professional creative technologist with a background in designing a lot of silly projects for exhibitions, i've got a massive lack of focus, tending to be caught by different whims for creative design based on different projects, finding the right tech to suit certain aspects.

I'm very used to a professional software world where there's a lot less room to play, so it's felt really nice to try and revive some of the passion that brought me into programming in the first place this year.\n\nA couple of my projects:\n\n• <https:\/\/nimby.bemben.co.uk\/|NimbyDex >- a highly insulting gemini agent with GL mapping frontend that attempts to quantify the \"NIMBY\"ness of cancelled renewable projects in the UK \n• <https:\/\/sheffield.ac.uk\/ideasbazaar\/projects\/inside-box|Think Inside The Box> - an old festival project that used a mixture of AR and VR to create small teaching moments for different engineering disciplines \n• 3D prints with LIDAR data to create little mementos + matchbox buildings for smaller venues with loads of charm.
