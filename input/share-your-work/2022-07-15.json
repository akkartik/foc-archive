To try and create the rule that folks over 18 are allowed to make wills, I made an ‘its true that’ block, put a ‘person is a category block’ in there, and then tried to make a ’person has the attributes ‘age’' block but the ‘known categories’ didn’t update. Cool tool! this kindof thing makes so much sense for a legal system from the perspective of someone outside of the legal world",
