For instance, not many folks are participating in the newsletter, even though it's very open for input."

After that survey is done and people have had a chance to respond, and after we've made whatever changes we're going to make to the community platform, I'm planning to spend some time adding additional tools like these ones you've found, and improving the documentation and first-run experience for people coming to the community. I think with a bit of work, we can make this community more engaging, more like a hub connecting all our efforts and projects, without making it too noisy for people who just want to casually follow along.\n\nThanks for the suggestions and taking the time to look up these tools!",
