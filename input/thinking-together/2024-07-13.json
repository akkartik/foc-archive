I think that's why Kartik searched for the manifestos, extracted the problems, I went towards making a document to collect and expand the points, towards a canonical intro\/overview and maybe to register items thereunder, and so on.\n\nI don't think form, lack of tooling or medium is a huge limiting factor, as one can bootstrap from a napkin. Not ideal, but it's a viable start, to then improve and replace it several times. I would be worried if perfect tooling, ideal conditions, etc. would be considered a requirement for starting some work, because that may simply never come. If trying to organize to improve the tooling and medium, can't, because there's no good tooling\/medium to organize that as well. It's a deadlock\/catch-22\/circular-reference situation, and instead (per Engelbart's example), simply bootstrap out and up from whatever.\n\nMy frustration is not primarily with the form\/medium. While that's bad, I think can be figured out and improved, already some simple measures help a lot. No, my frustration is with that there's a lot of *talk* about the great concepts, methods, etc. developed and demonstrated by other groups and the pioneers, but when it comes down to it, it's proven to impossible to find people who are 1. excited about these things and 2. more importantly, put some actual effort into trying.\n\nYou make it sound as if calls\/meetings, online or in-person, are inherently better (linear  audio being not too different from text chat - might even be worse, because is temporal, Kartik could never search for manifestos someone mentioned). I don't have good experiences with calls, to the contrary. I'm not really aware what came out of our calls, I don't see there's much practical work\/effort\/results\/progress in the project proposals we tried (or didn't try, failed to try). Alan Kay talks (PKM), book list (SVG), word list\/cloud (duplicate). Finally, concluded with instead talking to the Weco people. Or similarly, the World Wise Web experiment, spending lots of time on meetings, ends up abandoned, even if you did went to their place (village) for some time, or attended their calls. I'll just repeat once again, go take a look at <https:\/\/groupware-systems.org\/skreutzer\/online_collaboration_conversation_space.xhtml> (+ a few more not on the list, notably Canonical Debate Lab is nice, just is a closed group), listen to all their meeting recordings, maybe even go to their\/some place and meet them, talk some more, but I wonder what the results might be that you and me could use\/adopt. Worse, theirs is unlikely to be of the kind I want (some better \"future of coding\", solving some of the problems we identified, they're not working on that as that's too a non-goal for them as well). In 2018 I attended the Doug@50 calls whenever I could, and because it was just meetings\/calls, some prominent figures dominated the conversation (who weren't even much interested in the task, they were doing their own different thing instead, it's just these were more and louder). So the \"group\" (a bunch of individuals who disagree) couldn't arrive at agreement\/consensus, the attempts to make something shared was sabotaged, all efforts got scrapped, and everyone continued with their own thing (mostly what they were doing all along anyway). For that reason, I reject it as a model as I don't see it working. I should add, I'm also employed on a dayjob, and there I do have meetings, both in-person and online, and I can assure you that generally, most of them, are very ineffective, dysfunctional or counter-productive. There are some positive cases, and that's mostly per pushing for more effective meetings\/conversation (written agenda upfront, some moderation to stay on topic, written protocol, later working from the written protocol, etc.). While I'm not that good with that myself, at least I'm asking for it, while many don't agree and seem to not mind wasting lots of time (as evidently, no need to work and paid anyway, talking is cheap and easy). Ironically, such meetings are sometimes conducted by product managers or project managers, who really should have an interest to more effectively manage their projects and meetings. But this might be the case because they don't\/can't do the technical work themselves, so they do organizing\/meetings. Also, there might not be much training\/courses for effective meetings or project managers, I can imagine some simply slip into the role, even if not really good at it. Now thinking about it, while text chat isn't great, our discussion here might have been better than if it were a call or meeting, because everyone can jump in, pick points, we can (and Kartik did) extract some items, at least there's more\/better chance to organize, I learn things and have time to consider\/think-about.\n\nI want to recognize that Stefan Lesser suggested a meeting in person. OK, might be fine, as are calls or text chat, if you need to and can't do better. This would exclude everyone who can't be at the place in the time. Who knows, seems there's a bunch of Germans, that might help to meet locally. At the same time, there's a German meetup, and I wonder if you people attended these, what's discussed there, if any of that is towards some kind of shared project, and if it where, what is it, where is it? Is it hard to find out about it, if not attending in person? Then, what good is it? (per the method of not using software, the computer, the network, this is kind of anti-thetical, doing it like the since the beginning of time). Like, what is the plan for how to go about those who can't be there? Exclude, ignore? To me, these modes are not a good\/better experience either.\n\nTo really highlight the source of *my* frustration (might not be yours\/shared): form\/medium\/modality\/tooling is secondary (and improvable), but I don't see why or what for we would meet or start calls, given we already found out (with the help of primitive text chat) that most of us have very different goals (incompatible ones). While we agree on the problems, we're not going to constructively address them in a shared\/collective manner, as the intention\/choice or capacity or constraints (various other factors), that's the status quo and not much chance\/interest to change that. So why or what for would we call or meet? Continue with the disagreements and conflicting choices of approach in person? Adds some cost\/effort with no upside\/gain?\n\nIn a call or meeting, I would once again just repeat something like the book list metadata project. Or you and Kartik could meet\/call and start a project to import each other's custom Markdown (and then do that with a third guy's and then a fourth's). Or you don't and you each stay with PKM only. Or it's just exploration\/prototypes but a plan\/architecture\/system we don't have nor make.\n\nidk, I think I could live with text chat, online calls or in-person meetings. Would be perfectly fine if I organize some notes just for myself, tracking and review etc. (nobody needs to adopt, if no interest or don't see\/get any benefit out of it). For as long as there were some actual work\/research in a compatible manner and not only conflicting\/individual. Otherwise, why even chat\/call\/meet about it? If nothing is done about the problems identified, which works across projects\/software\/people, future pretty much won't be much different from the present or past. I don't think the amount of talking or medium makes a huge difference, if there's not much of this kind of work done. I just realize and once again repeat: *no, I don't want to sink again lots of time into just talking* about some proposal or this or that or read or write many more manifestos and some articles or whichever repo (you can rarely make much use of), absolutely not. I did try\/do that several times and I don't see why a few more times repeat the same exercise. As you see, I rather try to \"speedrun\", check see and probe what people are up to or not, I think I was relatively efficient to learn a number of things about FoC participants and community and it's setup and goals.\n\nTo do something different is probably to not do a\/the FoC thing, but see if something else and different could be done. I framed it various times as a new ARC\/PARC\/VPRI, specifically to avoid the effects observable here, and OK struggle if not outright impossible to find some person who's in favor of such and follows up with trying. So what to call\/meet about, about this? Again?\n\nI may add, reading curious-reader's posts here, if I'm not mistaken, your requirement is that some source should drop a lot of money to fund such research\/effort. Which didn't happen and likely won't. Also, not indicated what the money is even needed for and spent on. I assume, burn it on salaries.
