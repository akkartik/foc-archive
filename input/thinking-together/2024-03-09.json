A mock is an incomplete story of software physics. Which brings us the other side of the spectrum...\n\nThe IDEs — the code editors. The product you ship is here, so \"I guess someone has to go there\". First challenge: To most people it's walls of inexplicable symbols and weird (even hostile?) punctuation.

Mostly failing to do so. Then learning to get better at debugging. Eureka moments of finally solving the puzzle that unlocks a bugfix! Endlessly restarting programs to reset state. Today, even after multiple decades of investment in IDEs, coding is still 100 times harder and less fun than it should be! How can we truly move the needle?\n\nA traditional IDE deals with the how to fully describe the physics of a software system. Writing and editing algorithms. Managing data flows. Figuring out logic. Painting pixels. Sending data at the speed of light over the network. But the IDE doesn't actually let you _see_ the program as it manifests to the user in the final medium. It's running somewhere else — the browser, on your phone. This is where vector-tools have the IDEs at least partially beat. Yes, they're just mocks, but the vector-tool tool _sees_ the mocks alongside you. This changes your relationship with the tool. Thinking and touching — moving, dragging, scaling, rotating, duplicating — seamlessly blends on a canvas, and it just _feels_ _good, even fun!_ IDEs and editing code as text offers none of those things with today's tools, and it just feels like... friction!\n\nSo the letter to Santa reads as follows:\n\n_Dear Santa, give me the best parts of a vector-based design tool, plus the best parts of an IDE, rolled into one — but with none of the downsides.
