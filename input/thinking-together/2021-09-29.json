What this means in terms of limits and where it breaks down, is that the members of a circle must be willing to engage in civil discourse. They must be able to express themselves freely, openly, and with vulnerability. Holding back a frustration or anxiety because you don't want to \"rock the boat\" will cause problems down the line. Everyone in a circle needs to be able to bring themselves fully into that space. Something that is highly recommended in sociocratic literature is something called NVC or nonviolent communication. It is a toolbox for supporting open and honest communication with minimal conflict. The de-facto \"texbook\" on NVC is appropriately titled \"Nonviolent Communication\" by Marshall Rosenberg.\n\nFor the question of expertise, it essentially boils down to, as usual: \"are we okay with it?\" If the members of the circle don't understand the impact of the decision they are making, then the expert needs to make them understand. Not the details, per se, but the impact. No one should be pressured into accepting a decision that they don't understand. Alternatively, highly technical decisions could also be delegated to a child circle. If the members of the parent circle consent to the creation of a child circle that makes highly technical decisions without their direct involvement, that is perfectly valid as well. Since 2 members of the child circle are also members of the parent circle, there should be regular reporting of its activities, and since consent flows both ways, there should be solid information flow (feedback) such that the parent AIM is still the guiding star.\n\n<@U027P92A0N5> the speed of decision-making is a fascinating story from my experience. If sociocracy is a new thing for the group, then decision-making does take longer initially. There is a learning period. However, once the group really understands and puts into practice the philosophy of \"good enough for now, safe enough to try\" and really adhere to the idea of \"I can live with it\" rather than demanding their preference, then decision-making (and meetings) amazingly gets shorter! And yes, larger circles (20 or more) do indeed take a long time, so if a group is huge, the first order of business is for that large group to consent to the creation of an array of child circles to delegate some of the authority and responsibility to. In my coop, we do have a rather large \"member circle\" that is the parent of all other circles, but it hardly ever makes decisions, because we've created a Team circle, a Delivery circle, a Marketing circle, etc. The only time the main parent circle needs to meet and deliberate is with monumental decisions like changing the bylaws or changing the name of the coop, or something like that.\n\nAnother thing to note is that each circle, parent or child (or grandchild, etc etc) is a group of people that consent to how that circle is run. So if that group of people all agree and consent to meeting once a week for an hour, that's what happens. If they consent to majority voting for decision-making, that's what happens. If every member of the circle consents to a single member doing all the work for that circle, that's what happens. It's a very flexible and dynamic system, and with TERMS for circle \/ policy \/ roles, it ensures nothing is ever \"set in stone\" since everyone must consent to the TERM as well.",
