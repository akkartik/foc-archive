Well, my own research project puts a high value on democratization. Curv is a language for creating procedurally generated art. It needs to be usable by artists and designers and tinkerers. It needs to support exploratory and live coding. So it is a dynamically typed language. "Fighting the borrow checker" and "fighting the theorem prover/type checker" are not things I want to have in the user experience. If the goal was to prove programs correct at compile time, then I'd use a very different design, which would have a much higher learning curve. I'm skeptical about the existence of a universal programming language that satisfies all use cases.<br/><br/>Of course, it's possible for the research centre to have multiple teams focussed on solving different problems. I'm sure there is overlap to be found in the solutions for democratization, team productivity, and software correctness, and thus opportunity for collaboration between teams.
