<b>Future of Coding • Episode 55</b><br/><b>Man-Computer Symbiosis by J.C.R. Licklider</b><br/><a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/055">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/055</a><br/><br/>The podcast is back with an exciting new development — <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jimmy Miller</span> has joined the show as co-host. We'll be reading a number of papers from the history of our field, ranging from the beloved classics we all know by heart, to obscure and mysterious potential alternate histories that never came to be, and perhaps — perhaps! — one or two papers that really deserve nothing more than to wrap a dead fish. First up, squarely in the <em>beloved</em> camp, a classic from "Licky" himself.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy this episode — the paper was a fun read, and I think that really came through in our discussion. Also, I want to personally thank Jimmy for suggesting we do this together (and then patiently waiting for 9 months for me to finish Crosscut). I think this will breathe new life into the podcast, and help me keep new episodes coming out at a regular clip in the gaps where I'm too overwhelmed with <b> gestures everywhere </b> to do interviews. Here we go!
