programmers usually reject easy to use things, they always move the bar on what means to code, html and css, web, php, RoR are things that even being programming or really close are rejected as "not the real deal", I think it's wise for adalo and the whole no-code movement to not target current programmers, since they would reject them as toys even when they could gain a lot of productivity by not having to code a larger chunk of projects
