Hey everyone! I’m a Software Engineer and the founder of a startup called Midicircuit - a music education app that helps you get started making music. I used to be a rapper, I make beats and play the bass guitar.<br/><br/>I am originally from Lisbon, Portugal :smile: but have been living in London for 10y now and working with all kinds of startups as a perm and eventually as a contractor while bootstrapping my own ideas.<br/><br/>I have passions in tech, design, photograpy and in the past few years baking (lol, I have been “mastering” the art of the sourdough).<br/><br/>I joined this slack because in the space of a couple weeks “the future of code” has popped in my life at a party, some meetup recommendation and twitter. So I am really curious but also I am here to learn something new, to meet awesome people, maybe grab a coffee with them, build cool things together, to be serendiputous.<br/><br/>Thank you and,<br/><br/>Slack ya later :v::skin-tone-5:
