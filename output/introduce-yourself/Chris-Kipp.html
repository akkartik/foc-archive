Hi everyone :wave: . Really glad to be here. I'm a software engineer located in the Netherlands. I really enjoy working on developer tooling. Recently I've been pretty passionate about LSP (Language Server Protocol), and have been actively working on <a href="https://scalameta.org/metals/">https://scalameta.org/metals/</a>, the Scala Language Server and the Vim client. I also enjoy simple tech and exploring what that looks like in it's various shapes. I've enjoyed everything I've listened to and read so far from the Future of Coding, so I hope to continue to learn :smile:
