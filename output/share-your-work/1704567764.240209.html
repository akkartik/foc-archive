A few weeks ago I started a new series of blog posts (or “newsletters”, in Substack parlance) about <b>simplicity</b>:<br/><br/>1 • <em><a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity">On simplicity</a></em> introduces the series with how my thinking about simplicity has changed over the years.<br/>2 • <em><a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-2-meaning-ful-design">Meaning-ful design</a></em> connects simplicity to meaning making and coherence.<br/>3 • <em><a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-3-familiarity">Familiarity</a></em> explores how complex things can be surprisingly simple and why we can’t ignore context.<br/>4 • <em><a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-4-reciprocal-realization">Reciprocal realization</a></em> frames design as a complex dynamic process of mutual adaptation between designer and designed object.<br/>… <em>I expect about four or five more posts coming after that, but I haven’t written them yet, so I have no idea.</em> :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>A lot of this draws on 4E cognitive science, design theory, and philosophy. As such it may perhaps be less technical than you would expect it to be, although I try much harder in this series to relate it more directly to programming and software development than in <a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/previously-a-recap">my last</a>.<br/><br/>And that’s why I post it here, today. I’m hoping to learn if this resonates at all with a technical audience, or if this is still too abstract. I know we’re all craving for the easily applicable <em>Top 10 Things to Make Things Simple</em> (and number 6 will surprise you), but I have reason to believe that it’s just not that… well… simple. But I think I’m slowly making progress towards synthesizing something valuable, even if I can’t express it as beautifully as I would like to. Yet.<br/><br/>Let me know what you think, and please ask any questions you may have (in thread or via DM). Appreciate your feedback!

In the meantime, I published a few more posts in this series:<br/>5 • <em><a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-5-hiding-complexity">Hiding complexity</a></em> discusses how we mostly deal with complexity today and why that approach has limitations that lead to a software lifecycle that often ends in bloat or users looking for something new.<br/>6 • <em><a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-6-reducing-complexity">Reducing complexity</a></em> briefly looks at how and why we remove complexity today, and then proposes that maybe complexity isn’t actually something that needs to be removed, but something we crave; we need to shift our perspective to how we can grow complexity intelligibly.<br/>7 • <em><a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-7-unfolding-complexity">Unfolding complexity</a></em> takes Christopher Alexander’s fundamental process of Unfolding as a guide to how we can grow complexity in an intelligible way, and how this process is remarkably different to how we develop software today.<br/>8 • <em><a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com/p/on-simplicity-8-identity">Identity</a></em> sharpens an aspect I alluded to in the previous posts, but didn’t explain well enough — how important it is to create a strong identity, and how we usually end up doing the exact opposite.

These last four post address a common issue I see in software as it is created today: that over time most software seems to become less interesting and less relevant, ready to be replaced with something else, something new. While that may not strike you as a revelatory observation by itself, my reasoning why might.<br/><br/>It looks like there will still be a few more posts until I consider this series finished. One more thing I’m excited to get to over the next few posts is what I believe a most direct application of concepts from Christopher Alexander’s late work and magnum opus <em>The Nature of Order</em> to software development — a connection I’ve been trying to make for a long time (as in <em>years</em>).

As I keep writing my article series <em><a href="https://stefanlesser.substack.com">On Simplicity…</a></em> I’d like to further improve it with feedback and have now set up a first online discussion for it.<br/>On <b>Thursday, March 14th</b> we’ll start with discussing the first post in the series. You don’t need to be familiar with the whole series; just reading the first post is recommended but not required. Have a look at the <a href="https://lu.ma/p1p4b52k">Luma invite</a> for the exact time in your time zone and to sign up (it’s a free event via Zoom).<br/>Would be great to have some of you there!
