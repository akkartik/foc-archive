<b>Thoughts on low-code, nocode tools</b><br/><br/>My use case is simple. I want to build forms, avoid crud and send email notifications without writing a ton of code. Probably my favorite so far has been <a href="https://anvil.works/">https://anvil.works/</a> but even that was rejected. The most impressive was bubble. I will evaluate <a href="https://docs.budibase.com/">https://docs.budibase.com/</a>, <a href="https://enso.org/">https://enso.org/</a> over the weekend<br/><br/>Here are my gripes with the tools<br/><br/>1. JSON exports / Unreadable code generation - This just kills most solutions for me. For this reason I would much rather use tools like tailwind designer that generate readable Html5 code. Looking at you webflow.<br/>2. Cloud Only - If the trend of cloud goes on any longer I will be calling all offline apps and command line tools lightning apps. Pure offline support is important. Self hosting is important. I love node-red in this regard.<br/>3. Intimidating examples - My use case is simple. Most examples and documentation provide complex use cases. When learning programming in the text driven world, we start with “Hello World”, simple iteration, repl, libraries and shell scripts. Not only are these easy and fast to type, you can copy paste stuff to get things working. Copy paste is a killer feature of the text driven world.<br/>4. Tie in with frameworks and using the browser for editing code - This introduces too much dependency and breaks my existing way of working.<br/>5. Can’t re-use the components in existing projects - I think these platforms need to provide an api or hooks so that they are reusable in normal scripts. Perhaps 90% of the app can be designed in the browser but 10% can be done in the traditional way.<br/><br/>Here are some good enough and free solutions - stencil, mongodb, python scripting, wordpress, webkit shell for mobile apps, tailwind designer for UI. For a team &lt; 10, these solutions are workable with email and all of them are free. These solutions are simple. Perhaps no code is doing too many things at once ?

How complex are the forms that you want to build? Do they need lots of visbility conditions  and api integrations? Or more straight forward "contact forms"?

Contact forms and I want to build wizards like <a href="https://codepen.io/hofmannsven/full/arMzjO?ref=builtwithtailwind.com">this</a>. Perhaps with some ajax in-between.

We are building <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev">https://wasp-lang.dev</a>, with aim to make web app dev really simple, removing boilerplate but keeping the flexibility. It is a specialized DSL that works with React, nodejs, Prisma, and in the future with other technologies. Would this fit some of your points? We don't have anything yet for generation of forms, but we take care of a lot of other things if you are building a web app that has frontend,backend and database - although I am guessing that might be an overkill in your case? Generated code is readable, so that is one thing, you write code in your editor, and you can use existing JS libraries. It is still Alpha though so I wouldn't recommend it for production usage at the moment.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Martin Sosic</span> I like the approach but my use case is just forms. I am using python + js. I want to layout the forms with little to no effort. In many ways DSLs and declarative approaches are the no code of the text driven world.

Love your last sentence!<br/>What are you using python for - you are doing some processing on the backend then? But you are not storing anything I guess?

Its a fairly typical flask app. Just that I don’t want to build 10 forms, again. Nothing fancy. I like what <a href="https://docs.budibase.com/">https://docs.budibase.com/</a> is doing. Definitely has less tie in with frameworks and supports self hosting.

<a href="https://formik.org">https://formik.org</a> and <a href="https://formium.io">https://formium.io</a>, bur for react only. I’ll be crafting some sort of form tool myself soon. My aim is to use cross-framework <a href="https://xstate.js.org">https://xstate.js.org</a> to manage state and I want it to automatically have backend validation out of box, i.e. forms and backend(+frontend) validation generated out automatically (using pydantic for python or zod for typescript).<br/><br/>Whilst thinking about it, I think django might have got it right in terms of architecture (models, modelforms, form widgets, so it’ll be just deciding what has to replace each part.<br/><br/>I also know that i’ll be using <a href="https://www.storyblok.com">https://www.storyblok.com</a> for all the orchestration of all the missing pieces, it’s my base of all low-code platforms and it’s where I will have my forms built using drag-n-drop components.<br/><br/>Chances are I’ll come up with something in the comming few weeks, will try to share outcomes in this thread.<br/><br/>P.S. Could you elaborate on <tt>JSON exports / Unreadable code generation - This just kills most solutions for me.</tt> - not sure I fully what you meant with this.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tomas Čerkasas</span>  <a href="https://formium.io/">https://formium.io/</a>  fits my usecase for the design part but not the email triggers / db crud part. I am using wordpress forms to get the effect of formium for now. Webflow has a nice designer and database but the exported code  looks weird (see screenshot). Ideally I would like to self host, connect to existing dbs and use tailwind / bootstrap / plain html5 based code without all the weird ids. Perhaps html comments could be used to identify blocks of code instead of  <tt>&lt;div id="w…."</tt>  and changing css text also changes the numbers in the properties.

In the project that I am currently hired by, I have build a form solution using formik and because Kentico is used as a cms , it is easy to send emails after form submits. It also has a marketing automation flow editor which can be used if you need more then just a simple email. Kentico is not the cheapest cms. The site that I am working on is <a href="http://fnv.nl">fnv.nl</a> .. which is the biggest union here in the netherlands, so it is in dutch. Formik is definitely something I can recommend using. Although I've done a lot of custom work to build the features that we needed (visibility conditions and multi step form handling)
