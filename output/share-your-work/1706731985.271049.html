My PhD thesis about my ongoing attempts to marry AI and HCI is now up. (A lot of it is about academia, where those two fields <em>do not like</em> to talk.) Plenty of stuff about paper tools, rapid visualization prototyping, and the connection between domain-specific languages and direct-manipulation interfaces.<br/><a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/98c6j416#article_main">https://escholarship.org/uc/item/98c6j416#article_main</a>

Looks like great work, thanks for sharing! There should be more attempts like this at framing problems tackled in disparate scientific communities with unified conceptual frameworks.<br/><br/>Have you heard of the theory of <b>instrumental interaction</b> by Michel Beaudouin-Lafon? It aims at generalizing the concept of direct manipulation interface, through that of "interaction instrument" that mediates between  users and domain objects. I think this is quite relevant here, although the concept of interaction instrument may have a narrower concern than that of software instrument.

It is new to me, but I see I have retreaded some of HCI's ground, Thank you! I'd come across the Document Lens, which is one of their case studies, but not within the appropriate generalization to non-textual domain objects. The scope seems very similar; for example, navigation and filtering widgets are two familiar categories. The major difference seems to me that the authors wrote in a world prior to D3.js and its applications to (say) plotting grammars. That in turn brings us to the end-user programming problem - whether users, even expert users, want to learn a new language, - which is what motivates me to use CSCW's lenses of the paper tool and the boundary object.

I see that Beaudouin-Lafon has recently presented instrumental interaction, human-computer partnerships, and communities & common objects as a complementary set of theories. This is fantastically useful to me! In fact I spent my entire ch3. spinning up a <b>generative theory</b> from scratch, in order to "bridge the gap between HCI research and artifact design," as they've put it.<br/><a href="https://hal.science/hal-03434142/file/GenTheory%20authorversion.pdf">https://hal.science/hal-03434142/file/GenTheory%20authorversion.pdf</a><br/><br/>Anyway, there is probably some insight that AI / game studies - by way of generative design in procedural narrative - can bring to bear on this theory which bears our name. Ha ha, ha.

glad I could bring a useful reference :grin: and I'll definitely give a more careful read to your thesis! (just read the intro for now)
