But with software these concerns directly affect the consumer, albeit after some delay. Hmm, arguably climate change is the same though the delay is a little greater. Not the fight I've chosen, but I'm definitely glad others care about these issues.\n\nYou're right that it depends on the business model. I don't claim a solution has to not involve money. I just claim that merely adding money to an existing business model isn't always going to improve things. Maybe that's our point of agreement?\n\nThe whole point of money has been that it made the incommensurable commensurable. If that is becoming increasingly untrue then the role of money is arguably becoming a lot less central to the economy.

Hmm, arguably climate change is the same though the delay is a little greater. Not the fight I've chosen, but I'm definitely glad others care about these issues.\n\nYou're right that it depends on the business model. I don't claim a solution has to not involve money. I just claim that merely adding money to an existing business model isn't always going to improve things. Maybe that's our point of agreement?\n\nThe whole point of money has been that it made the incommensurable commensurable. If that is becoming increasingly untrue then the role of money is arguably becoming a lot less central to the economy. We need to be teaching kids and people to think more about business models and supply chains."
