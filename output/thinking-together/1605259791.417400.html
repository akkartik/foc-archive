A small question, do we have a channel to share some fun / light things about computing (some meme or something) or you guys think it will pollute the Slack?

Immediate reaction: #present-company or #thinking-together depending on how generative you find it. Potential for ideas is subjective so follow your gut. But <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> or others may feel differently.

Agreed. I'd default to #present-company unless it's highly generative of FoC discussion (in which case #thinking-together or #linking-together)

I would vote for a separate channel. #present-company seems like a serious channel for discussions of the current state, and I was reluctant posting random memes and off topic there. A new high-noise random/fun channel seems like a better fit

I would rather not have memes or other low-effort content, except in the rare case there's an actual discussion to be had about it. If it's allowed, I worry that it would be the bulk of the new content, since this slack is relatively low-traffic, but memes are easy to post. Also, I'm not precisely sure how big a problem this actually is, but it would cut into our 10,000 post history limit.

I would love to see more memes and jokes in this slack. That's a good opportunity to socialize and have fun with like-minded people. I do acknowledge that this changes dynamics, and not everyone wants this—that's why a separate opt-in channel seems like a good compromise.

We've had this exact discussion a few times now, and the #present-company channel was created as a catch-all for this sort of content. It's for stuff that's not quite "on-topic" for the future of computing, but not quite off-topic either. The name "Present Company" is a play on words:<br/>• If you want to talk about matters of present-day computing, this is the channel<br/>• If you want to enjoy the company of others via lighthearted or playful digressions, this is the channel<br/>We're using this name instead of "Random" or "Off-topic" because we don't want to encourage <em>only</em> that sort of stuff there. It's more open than that.<br/><br/>No, I'm not going to create a new channel just for memes and jokes at this time. Please post all memes and jokes in #present-company. I don't for a second believe that the channel will devolve into frustrating noise and pabulum — on balance, this community has good taste. If the discussion there becomes too banal, I'll make adjustments. Not gonna do that defensively, though, because I'd rather let a thousand flowers bloom, you know?
