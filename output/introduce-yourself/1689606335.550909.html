Hi all I am Avon, my background is in music (guitar + pure data) and delay tolerant networking. I actually found future of coding through the podcast episode with pd creator Miller Puckette.<br/>My current interest is in building collaborative, itemized, computing environments, inspired by the writings of <a href="https://alexanderobenauer.com/articles/os/1/">Alexander Obenauer</a>. The current path I'm taking towards this goal is working with <a href="https://project-mage.org/">Project Mage</a>, and trying to connect Mage's data representation system called <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub3/giuse_dario_1987_1/giuse_dario_1987_1.pdf">KR</a>, to a delay-tolerant data synchronization protocol called <a href="https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar-spec/blob/master/protocols/BSP.md">Bramble</a>. You can read more about this idea here: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~project-mage/discussions/%3C6fb9dbc5-1c58-cf36-5dcb-8cd1813e3cc4%40gmail.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~project-mage/discussions/%3C6fb9dbc5-1c&hellip;</a><br/><br/>My overarching goal with this work is to build the tools necessary to create multi-computer, collaborative computing environments. Initially this is just going to be software, but eventually I would like to branch into physical environments and explore how this software interacts with alternative human computer interfaces like Dynamicland, possibly paired with modular building systems like <a href="https://openstructures.family/about">OpenStructures</a> and <a href="https://gridbeam.xyz/">GridBeams</a>.<br/> <br/>Feeling really grateful that I found a community of others interested in similar ideas. :smiley:<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Avon (@t400@iffy.info)

I had not seen KR before. One thing I think that systems like this really need is inheritance/aliasing of property/link names as well as values. <br/><br/>If you want lots of people to collaborate efficiently on something like this I think you need to incorporate lots of slack/slop and give the ability to easily plug in the missing plumbing as and when it is required.<br/><br/>FYI <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Alexander Obenauer</span> occasionally posts here.
