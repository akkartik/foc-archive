Hi all! I've been working on a web development platform called Boomla for 14 years, I'm sort of coming out of the bush these days. <a href="https://boomla.com/">https://boomla.com/</a> I also call it a Website OS as it is a platform where websites are first-class citizens.<br/>It is a server-side platform, with its own object-oriented filesystem, functional execution model, package management solution, etc. It can currently be programmed in JavaScript on the server, but it will support multiple languages in the future.<br/>It also provides a drag&amp;drop user-interface for end-users to let them build websites. But that's optional, you could build a different frontend for it.<br/>It has a web based IDE and lots of documentation. I made the decision early to focus on the platform and not write any new programming language. :smile:<br/>It was designed to be low on maintenance. The platform is fast and rock solid stable. Developers tend to agree that the most interesting part of the system is the object oriented filesystem with lots of interesting properties.<br/>I'm glad for the existence of the group, looking forward to interesting conversations!
