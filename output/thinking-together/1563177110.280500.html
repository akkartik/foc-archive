I find autocompletion for API stuff pretty great. I love that I can browse the API and an object's properties or methods and their arguments and types.<br/><br/>I'm not convinced autocompletion of things like quotes, HTML tags, parenthesis, brackets, is a win yet. It's possible there is some sweet design I'm unaware of but in all the editors I use often I find this particular feature something I fight with to the point that if it's not an net loss it's at least not net positive. I suppose by that argument it actually is a net loss since having to deal with it is worse than not.<br/><br/>If it's not clear what I mean I type a quote <tt>"</tt> and the editor/IDE immediately inserts two quotes <tt>""</tt> and puts the cursor in-between. I find often the editors I use get it wrong and it's several keystrokes to get the editor to insert what I want, not what it wants.<br/><br/>Anyone else have similar experiences or see designs that "just work"? AFAICT this is a problem with structured editors in general as they can't tell what I want to type. They can only tell what keys I press. So if I typed <tt>{</tt> but meant to type <tt>[</tt> they could have already inserted 3 to 5 lines to code which now have to manually delete. They might work if press undo but the natural thing to do when I press the wrong key is to press backspace but if IDE inserted a bunch of stuff it has no way to know if I want to backspace over one of the many character it just inserted or if just want to backspace over the one character I thought it was going to insert.

two extremely successful plugins are parinfer <a href="https://youtu.be/K0Tsa3smr1w">https://youtu.be/K0Tsa3smr1w</a> for lisp (it actually backs it up with an algebra) and Emmet for the html stuff you describe: <a href="https://emmet.io/">https://emmet.io/</a>
