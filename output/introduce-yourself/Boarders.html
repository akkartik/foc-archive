Hi all, I am an ex-mathematician turned programmer interested in stuff like type theory functional programming etc. Professionally I work on a bioinformatics platform written in haskell. I am also interested (but much less knowledgeable) about creative programming and ways to make programming accessible. I was inspired to join the slack after the excellent recent episode on the survey of the community. Previously I only listened to the podcast (which <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> has so far been killing it on) but am inspired to see what the wider community is like.
