In #thinking-together I mentioned a user study where I got a bunch of participants by embedding it within an intro to Node.js class. I rummaged around in my filesystem and found the original instructional materials for nostalgia's sake.<br/><br/>Bits are funny in hindsight, like, "<em>Node.js is minimalistic. Node.js programmers tend to make libraries that you can plug into your project, rather than frameworks that you're supposed to plug your project into.</em>" And stuff that was intended to be funny at the time, like, "<em>[Redis is] 'schema-less', which means that your schema is defined in comments littered throughout your code, instead of in the database.</em>"<br/><br/>But mostly, I'm just floored by how much effort I put in, like writing code examples where nearly every token has contextual explanation in styled hover-text, and taking incredible care to copy relevant reference information onto every page.<br/><br/>So I thought I'd drop a link here for fun: <a href="https://github.com/alltom/node-course">https://github.com/alltom/node-course</a> It's a series of static HTML files you're meant to open from your filesystem, but you can also just type the names after <a href="http://alltom.github.io/node-course/">http://alltom.github.io/node-course/</a> The Theseus intro starts at <a href="http://alltom.github.io/node-course/public/tutorial-05.html">http://alltom.github.io/node-course/public/tutorial-05.html</a> I particularly like step 12.

Grad students have so much free time! For every software dependency, I included screenshots of the download links (!), and instructions for validating that the installation succeeded.
