Coltrane got into heroin and then kicked it so there an intensity in his work, depending on his physical state, that is quite extreme. And of course you are getting McCoy Tyner who is super great. Tyner still performs a bit, he is one of the only survivors of that era. sorry i misspelled Durufle earlier. He wrote very little music, but his Requiem i believe is even nicer than Faure's.
