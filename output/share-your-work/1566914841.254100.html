now, say you find the canonical representation for a square and you really can share your representation, you may many times want to operate on a sequence of those squares, vectorized instructions on the cpu may be handy, but they expect arrays of points, now the best representation of a square is 4 arrays of points, should we? are we going to force all our abstractions to handle 4 arrays because we feel that's a better representation?
