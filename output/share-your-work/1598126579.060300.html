I'm prototyping a new approach to drawing dynamic pictures with direct manipulation. So far, I've been calling it "Apparatus with Magnets". We'll see if the name... sticks. :wink:<br/><br/>Here's a "project proposal": <a href="https://www.notion.so/Apparatus-with-Magnets-077e72bc1ebf4f7a9ec512ef76d47994">https://notion.so/Apparatus-with-Magnets-Intro-2e32af5b59b64a45b3b203408374a56e</a><a href="https://www.notion.so/Apparatus-with-Magnets-077e72bc1ebf4f7a9ec512ef76d47994">….</a> Progress is slow but steady. Feedback is welcome!

I was just thinking about <a href="../linking-together/1595628356.371600.html">the idea of a tool that looks works like this</a> a few weeks ago. I wasn't aware of Apparatus, or your work! very cool! thank you :slightly_smiling_face:

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ray Imber</span> Your relating AwM to a "node-and-wire" interface is thought-provoking. My first reaction was to draw a distinction – snapping in AwM is a direct action on the artifact being created, while snapping in node-and-wire interfaces is only a direct action on the abstract structure of the program. But it's a really interesting point of comparison, and I think there's a lot of space to blur the lines between them.<br/><br/>For instance – I haven't imagined that AwM would entirely eliminate the "spreadsheet" part of Apparatus. Snaps can't express all possible relationships between parts of a picture, especially when the parts are physically far apart. But where should these spreadsheet cells and links between them live? The node-and-wires model suggests that they could be present in the diagram's canvas, rather than a separate plane (like in Apparatus). Lots of interesting directions to go there!

&gt; The node-and-wires model suggests that they could be present in the diagram's canvas, rather than a separate plane<br/>A problem with "node-and-wire" interfaces is that they can get very dense, reducing understanding.<br/><br/>Your phrase "separate plane" reminds me of map overlays as a possible solution.<br/>You could represent much of that data as different views on the canvas, that can be switched between or overlaid on top of each other. GIS can be quite beautiful. :stuck_out_tongue:

Very interesting! :slightly_smiling_face: Can't wait to see what you will build.<br/><br/>Do you have started some implementation? What do/will you use? HTML/JavaScript? Other?<br/><br/>What do you think of "reactive" framework, like Vue.js? Reading your intro, it makes me think this this kind of framework can be a good fit to implement tools with bindings between several representations (the spatial canvas, the sheet, others...).

Also, I am just starting digging in generative art (in fact, I am a completely new to it), but my feeling is that your way to express constraints can be very interesting for it. And I was just wondering how randomness can fit in your system. I.e. like a spread with random intervals between magnets or with some magnets that deleted, etc.

Very excited to see where this goes!<br/>The snapping being an extension to/equivalent to dragging seems promising from a UX perspective, particularly if it can be made clear after the fact what 'type' of drag created it.<br/>-&gt; is there an exhaustive list of the type of snaps? e.g translate, scale, rotate... if it's a small list then there maybe some scope for replacing the circular nodes with appropriate icons (or adding icons somewhere...)<br/><br/>spreads seems like an intuitive approach to one of the CS fundamentals - repetition<br/>conditionals seem more abstract, and I'm not sure to what extent you can represent them, particularly if the other visual variables (colour, opacity, texture, position...) are all reserved for the user... I imagine they'd probably need a separate view, either for abstract conditionals in general or looking at a particular group (however that's defined), and showing all the potential <em>alternatives</em>
