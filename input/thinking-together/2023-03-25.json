It's going to turn up the heat by a few degrees, but we're already on fire.\n\nThis makes me sound pessimistic, but I think I'm feeling more neutral than anything.

I know who made my belt because it was hand-made for me (see: hipster), but I don't know who made my sneakers. I know who made the art on my walls, but not the art on the covers of my books. I know who made the music in my mp3 folder, but not the music in my streaming playlists.\n\nAI is going to intensify existing forces that separate creation and consumption. It's going to turn up the heat by a few degrees, but we're already on fire.\n\nThis makes me sound pessimistic, but I think I'm feeling more neutral than anything. My guess is that things will continue to go the way they have gone, at roughly the rate they've already been going, maybe a little quicker."
