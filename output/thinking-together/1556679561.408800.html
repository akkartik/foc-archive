Abstraction is the key word that I haven't heard in this discussion about complexity. An abstraction is a filter for irrelevant details. In fact, I'll make the claim that abstraction is far more important than the nebulous concept of composability. After all, stateful imperative code is highly composable: you can put two sequences of instructions together to get another sequence. Composing sequences of instructions does not yield an abstraction however, so the number of details keeps increasing indefinitely. Hence large blocks of imperative code are complex. Functions are a common unit of abstraction, and a well-designed (or "simple") function will let you forget about the details of its workings. A poorly designed (or "complex") function will not.
