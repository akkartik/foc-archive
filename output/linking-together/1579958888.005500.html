In #random, you can post anything <em>except</em> stuff that's relevant to FoC. So, no worries, this post is just fine!

Sure, I started doing the survey. However, the survey progress doesn’t take into account answers to previous questions.<br/><br/>For example, I said “no” to “do you listen to something while commuting”, but the next question still asked me “what do you listen to”.<br/><br/>Also, at some point I had to add the option “Car CD player” to “what app do you use to listen to music” :grin: Because that’s true.<br/><br/>I’d say the survey assumes a lot about people’s way of life.<br/>

Unfortunately, type form only let's you do a "logic jump" if you are using the paid version. That is why he could not bring people to the end as soon as they answered "No".<br/><br/>About the Car CD Player, i guess you have a text option if you choose "Other" in that question.

I was tempted to fill in "Musical Instruments", since I play music. But it was asking about <em>apps</em> so I figured my answer was too snarky and out of scope.
