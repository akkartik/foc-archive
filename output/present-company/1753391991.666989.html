I was considering posting about a (remote) job opening at my company for a C#/TypeScript developer, but Ivan's company is honestly, probably, superior. I used to be active here at FoC over four years ago, but then I got a job, and then the cofounder left, and I felt it necessary to build the product by myself. That product is basically "done" now, except not really, because every new customer wants new features.<br/><br/>I really miss working working on programming-language design (see <a href="http://loyc.net">loyc.net</a>) and my developer tools such as SyncLib, but right now I need a helping hand to (1) get more people buying our product and (2) help me hire more developers so that I (or we) can quit this job in 12 months or so. Right now we only have two developers, and the CEO wants to hire literally every person we interview, as he hates putting time into the hiring process. I'm pushing back on that because I only want certain kinds of people - probably the kinds of proactive people who would hang out in the communities I like, such as FoC, <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">EA</a>, <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/">ACX</a>/<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/about/">SSC</a> and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality">LW</a>.<br/><br/>So for those in need of a paycheck, maybe consider working with me? Some personal characteristics: as an EA I care deeply about the future (fighting global poverty but also mitigating global risksâ€•the latter being severe these days); I don't suffer fools and prefer to be blunt (which creates friction with the CEO, who is nontechnical and very sensitive to tone); I'm unconventional and can't stand people who like doing things the "standard way" just because "it's a standard" without being able to defend the pros and acknowledge the cons; I don't care for smalltalk (my idea of smalltalk is discussing optionally persistent data structures, or plausible global catastrophe scenarios); and I'm a stickler for good communication (detail, precision, accuracy, reasonableness, and ambiguity avoidance).<br/><br/>Our product serves three different submarkets and has 125,000 lines of code (excluding tests, blank lines and generated code, but including 10,000 lines of comments, and yes, we should probably have a lot more comments). I mention this because I think typical developers would've written 500,000 lines to accomplish the same stuff. Here are my <a href="https://loyc.net/2020/principles-of-programming.html">Principles of Programming</a>. If you think about programming in a similar way, we should get along great!

Also, I have no experience as a salesman and it shows. Right? I think I'm supposed to say stuff like "Do you want to work at a fast-paced, results-focused company without a foosball table? We'e looking for a junior, intemediate or senior developer with solid communication skills who can defend their technical choices with solid reasoning. We value direct communication and technical reasoning over diplomacy. Blah blah blah AI!"

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@David Piepgrass</span> can you share more about your product? It looks really interesting
