hello! Just came across the FoC community on the fediverse and realized that this is definitely the place to be. I don't have any real professional or academic background in language development or future-of-code adjacent work, but it's something I've been interested in for a long time. I am particularly interested in the struggle between highly interactive, live-coding, "fun" programming and the more serious and verifiable/reliable/compiled processes.<br/>I don't really have any work to share <em>yet</em> but I think that engaging with the community here can help me remain motivated and interested in projects (working full-time as a software engineer can sap your enthusiasm for fun research stuff outside of work.)

"I am particularly interested in the struggle between highly interactive, live-coding, "fun" programming and the more serious and verifiable/reliable/compiled processes."<br/>That's one of my main current interests as well. And the reason why I am actively experimenting with both <a href="http://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a> and <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a>.

Welcome! :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>I didn’t know what “fediverse” was and I quickly landed on <a href="https://fediverse.party">https://fediverse.party</a> :exploding_head:<br/><br/>On a sidenote: what’s “Element Bridge” and how can I find the user profile referenced by the bot’s message?

Re: the Element Bridge, I am messaging from the Matrix rooms that are bridged to Slack, because I'm already invested in the matrix ecosystem. <a href="https://matrix.org/">https://matrix.org/</a> has the details.<br/><br/>Because I'm messaging from Matrix (Element is the standard matrix client), I don't think there is a slack user profile for me.
