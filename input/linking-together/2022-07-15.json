This distinction isn't quite the same one as worse is better. Are there any good articulations of this middle ground in a more detailed way?\nPhrased as an answer to your question rather than a new question: to make systems that are as simple as possible but no simpler, first articulate what you want. The language to do that must come from the context of use. Christopher Alexander shows a particularly systematic way of doing that in _Notes on the Synthesis of Form_. His approach is too heavyweight for most situations, but I still find it enormously clarifying to think in his terms. Above all, what situations do you want to avoid?\n\nWhen we bluntly transplant a tool into a new context of use, we take on a whole lot of interface complexity and UX frustration. Based on those frustrations we try to post-mortem the issues with the tool and its implementation. But we're largely looking in the wrong place. It's like there's a level of source code for the context of use that never made it past transplant. It was in the air pre-transplant, but inevitably left behind during transplant.\n\nThis is my best attempt so far at a more detailed picture of \"complexity in moderation\". It's not moderation at all, it's entropy. You lost the basis vectors under which the tool had minimum complexity. To my knowledge there's no way to reconstruct them once lost.",

Above all, what situations do you want to avoid?\n\nWhen we bluntly transplant a tool into a new context of use, we take on a whole lot of interface complexity and UX frustration. Based on those frustrations we try to post-mortem the issues with the tool and its implementation. But we're largely looking in the wrong place. It's like there's a level of source code for the context of use that never made it past transplant. It was in the air pre-transplant, but inevitably left behind during transplant.\n\nThis is my best attempt so far at a more detailed picture of \"complexity in moderation\". It's not moderation at all, it's entropy. You lost the basis vectors under which the tool had minimum complexity. To my knowledge there's no way to reconstruct them once lost."
