It's a fount of FoC-relevant ideas. For instance, combining _the place where the programming happens_ with _the place where the program runs,_ but even further _using the same tools for building and working inside the program._ Also, Crosscut tries to _not feel like programming_, and present a minimalist interface that is ruthlessly focused on emulating the best aspects of traditional pen &amp; paper. If you haven't taken the time to read the essay, you're.. probably busy, I shouldn't bother you, sorry. I'll just leave a note on the door.\n\nBefore working on Crosscut, I had been slowly chipping away at my own FoC project called <https:\/\/ivanish.ca\/hest-time-travel\/|Hest> (yeah, still just that one blog post). I also made a podcast just to think out loud about the project, so that I could self-reflect and thus hone my ideas and goals, and maybe someday build another prototype. But when the Crosscut project started, it drew all my attention, and the podcast stopped.\n\nToday, with Crosscut done and released to the world, I'm here to share a new Hest podcast episode — 46 minutes long — in which I compare and contrast Crosscut and Hest.\n• How are their prototypes similar and different?\n• What goals do they share and disagree on?\n• How has my work on Crosscut shaped my thoughts on visual programming generally?\n• What effect will that have as I continue pursuing Hest (or any other FoC projects)?\nTo find out, kindly use <https:\/\/ivanish.ca\/hest.rss|this hand-crafted RSS feed>, search for *Hest* or *Ivan Reese* in your podcast player of choice, or click one of the buttons here: <https:\/\/pod.link\/1559446316>\n\nAnd stay tuned for more episodes. They won't be on a schedule, but they will be about as relevant and entertaining as this fine slack message. So, fifty-fifty, eh? ;)",
