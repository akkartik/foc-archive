        "text": "Lots of thoughtful responses here. I'll add a couple of thoughts that hopefully haven't already been mentioned:\n\na) Be aware of the human need for status. It's a biological thing ( <http:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/news\/2007\/march7\/sapolskysr-030707.html>), and it's at the bottom of the Maslow hierarchy. You can survive a couple of minutes without air, a few days without food and a few months without status. But you will end up with a sort of deficiency disease.\n\nIf this seems like a possibility, short-term solutions are unfortunately difficult. Try to find status outside work. Keep getting better at your job so that you can eventually parlay it into a higher-status one. Growing older helps too.\n\nb) If you can anticipate the Architecture Astronomy argument you can also try to address it. There's a reason Joel Spolsky's article is widely known: it's actually a valid point a lot of the time. Engage with criticism you see.\n\nc) The thread before yours is relevant: <https:\/\/futureprogramming.slack.com\/archives\/C5T9GPWFL\/p1537671606000100>. Independent of the relative status of developers in an organization, there's a way that all developers are disempowered today: extreme division of responsibilities leading to consensual gridlock. Creators of a library often can't make changes because their users will complain. And users often can't make changes to their dependencies because of fear of forking, unnecessary complexity due to compatibility constraints and historical artifacts.\n\nd) Consider slacking off on side projects at work. We've all done it from time to time; a terminal window arouses less comment than a browser open to Reddit. You'll get better as a developer, which is better for your employer and also better for your future status prospects. And it'll keep you sane. Obviously juggling with responsibilities is non-trivial, but if you're currently under-performing there's not much to lose there.\n\nAs I look over my list, only d) is really actionable. c) is my research project, and who knows one day I may have a solution to propose. But hopefully seeing a few possible reasons you feel as you do will help manage your motivation and energy levels.",

But you will end up with a sort of deficiency disease.\n\nIf this seems like a possibility, short-term solutions are unfortunately difficult. Try to find status outside work. Keep getting better at your job so that you can eventually parlay it into a higher-status one. Growing older helps too.\n\nb) If you can anticipate the Architecture Astronomy argument you can also try to address it. There's a reason Joel Spolsky's article is widely known: it's actually a valid point a lot of the time. Engage with criticism you see.\n\nc) The thread before yours is relevant: "

Independent of the relative status of developers in an organization, there's a way that all developers are disempowered today: extreme division of responsibilities leading to consensual gridlock. Creators of a library often can't make changes because their users will complain. And users often can't make changes to their dependencies because of fear of forking, unnecessary complexity due to compatibility constraints and historical artifacts.\n\nd) Consider slacking off on side projects at work. We've all done it from time to time; a terminal window arouses less comment than a browser open to Reddit. You'll get better as a developer, which is better for your employer and also better for your future status prospects. And it'll keep you sane. Obviously juggling with responsibilities is non-trivial, but if you're currently under-performing there's not much to lose there.\n\nAs I look over my list, only d) is really actionable. c) is my research project, and who knows one day I may have a solution to propose. But hopefully seeing a few possible reasons you feel as you do will help manage your motivation and energy levels."
