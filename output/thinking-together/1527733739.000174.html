<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Guido Bartolucci</span> Funny you mention 0.1 + 0.2.  I recall giving a quite the "presentation" to my colleagues when some millions were at stake.  We've been moving our arithmetic to the server ever since.  Leads to the only general principle of interactive systems that I have any confidence in.  Progress is when there's something you used to worry about, but now you don't.  Regress is when there's something you used to never worry about, but now you do.  And reality is the two perpetually come in pairs.
