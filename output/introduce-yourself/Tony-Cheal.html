Hi everyone! I'm a mathematician of a similar age as <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span> and have programmed since the tail end of the punched card era, mostly at a low level - digging myself upwards from designing and building assemblers, debuggers, compilers, and interpreters to graphical editors (2D and 3D), to web design (frontend and backend).<br/><br/>I taught Maths and then Computer Science at a Cambridge, UK sixth form and saw the introduction of the BBC Micro. This led me eventually to quitting teaching and writing software for the first ARM-based computer (the Acorn Archimedes) having borrowed one for a weekend to port the virtual machine for an APL interpreter (which could also run on the BBC Micro).<br/><br/>The (minimal) original website for my company is still up and running (<a href="http://www.acecomp.demon.co.uk/">http://www.acecomp.demon.co.uk/</a>) and there's a brief mention of some earlier work on the Binary Dinosaurs site (<a href="http://www.binarydinosaurs.co.uk/Museum/icl/tcheal.php">http://www.binarydinosaurs.co.uk/Museum/icl/tcheal.php</a>). My company merged with two other small UK software houses who produced a HyperCard-like programming system (Genesis) for the Archimedes. I am currently employed by an NLP specialist - designing a new web-based front-end for their product. I have also recently been teaching CS again, now that the UK syllabus has returned to something more like the one I taught in the 1980s.<br/><br/>I have been working on attempts to improve programming itself for about 25 years, mostly due to a random thought in about 1993 which means I can no longer program without thinking "This could be a lot easier..." every time I hit a key. I've set myself a deadline for September to produce something a bit more public, as a self-imposed incentive. I've probably now gone down most dead-ends, so I'm hoping that failure experience will eventually pay off.
