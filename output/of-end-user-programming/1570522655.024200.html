Time is a problem, especially when people don't enjoy the process, feel dumb, or think what they're learning isn't relevant<br/>In terms of learning/teaching coding I'm been moving away from optimizing for time-shortest dependency path and towards maximizing relevancy/joy<br/>However, relevancy/joy are very audience &amp; culture specific, so the wins are a bit smaller :confused:<br/>I'd love to have a framework/place where people from different cultures can maintain their own "branches" (really products) but leverage some of the harder/longer-to-code stuff, maybe even brand them differently
