I've never seen anything like this in an ACM conference. I know it <b>looks</b> like a prank, but I think that there are core ideas in the paper that can be taken seriously, once you decode the jargon. Consider Ubuntu and Smalltalk. Both are technically "open source", but Ubuntu is neoliberal, and Smalltalk is anarchist. In Ubuntu, although you technically can get access to the source, you need to use the CLI to install source packages, and then you need a huge amount of technical expertise to make changes to the source, build new versions of the software, and install your modified programs. And then you are in trouble if you want to update. It's neoliberal because of the power imbalance between the user and the corporate structure that controls the source. In Smalltalk, all of the source code for the system you are running is instantly available, you can easily make small changes just by editing some text, and then you can immediately see the effects of your changes within a running system. The user has much more power and autonomy in a Smalltalk system: it is an anarchist approach to open source.
