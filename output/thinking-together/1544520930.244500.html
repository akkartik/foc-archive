There are a lot of new programmers coming into the business, with shiny new Apple laptops ready to create mashups of different subsystems, and create wonderful new products. but perhaps we can create objective measurements that we can apply to code so that we steer towards quality. It has really been something that experienced people are good at gauging, but a more objective standard would be nice. It is hard to enter the world of interchangeable parts when people don't label inputs and outputs clearly. And it is so hard to document data structures in text. maybe markdown with embedded graphics needs to become the standard.
