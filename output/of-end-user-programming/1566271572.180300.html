Taking a few trains of thought (one passed by nasty station called "Groupware"), here's an idea: collaborative first seems like the right goal but something seems to go sour with in the primarily collaborative direction.  If the software is only suited for teams and not for collaborating with yourself or you and a friend, then something isn't right.  In contrast, something is very right when the software is good for self or small group collaboration together with world wide publishing/remixing.  Consider that Git/Github, for all of their many flaws, do scale up and down nicely.
