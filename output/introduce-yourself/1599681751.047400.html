Hi! I'm Denny Vrandečić. I am the founder of Wikidata, and am working now on a new project for the Wikimedia Foundation which we currently call Wikilambda (a naming discussion will start soon) with the goal to democratize coding and access to code by providing a "Wikipedia of Functions". I thought this might be an interesting community to chat with! :slightly_smiling_face:

Welcome Denny! Yes, that sounds like exactly the sort of thing this community will jump into with both feet. I'm glad you've found us.<br/><br/>Feel free to post relevant links in #share-your-work, or begin general discussions about the project (or other ideas about the future of computing) in #thinking-together.

Sounds like an interesting project.<br/><br/>The term "function" means different things to different people; what definition would be used for this project? Can the submitted functions have side-effects (perform mutation, or perform I/O through system interfaces)? Or is this more about mathematical ("pure") functions?<br/><br/>A related question: what level of generality should the submitted functions have? Should they be implementations of broadly-applicable algorithms, or can they be arbitrary code snippets from a random UI framework?

no side effects, and they must be idempotent (kinda comes with the "no side-effect"), also because we have no state. That won't be 100% strict, I am afraid, but that's where we want to start and see how we can evolve from there.<br/><br/>The second question is something that will be up to the community and the rules they will create for the system. Since most arbitrary code snippets from a random framework would pull in most of the rest of the framework, they probably won't do well in the system. More self-contained functions are the goal. Also, no state means that most frameworks are excluded.<br/><br/>Hope that makes sense.

Welcome Denny! Your project sounds interesting indeed. The "Wikipedia of functions" label seems to suggest that collective iterative improvement is a core principle of the system, is that right? That could be very valuable in the long run, but also requires dealing with the inevitable religious fights on what constitutes "good code".

Very interesting project, I would love to hear more about it! Can you share some more information about WikiLambda? (in an other channel, as Ivan suggested). In particular will it be a new language or will it be based on some existing (standard) one?

Is this primarily intended to be a learning resource, where people read the code, or a practical resource which people make use of? I think this distinction might affect whether a complicated optimization is included.<br/><br/>Also, how abstract is this going to be? For example, will you have an abstract notion of an integer, or a concrete notion such as BigEndianInt64. For some functions (which perform clever bit operations) this can matter quite a lot.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Denny Vrandečić</span> That abstract looks interesting... the preprint is on my ebook reader for the weekend. The "Abstract Wikipedia" project looks a bit like an open version of Stephen Wolfram's vision of a computational encyclopedia. And even though the development processes of the two projects are at the opposite ends of the spectrum, I think Wikipedia could learn a lot from his work.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span> yes, I am well aware of his work (although I have to admit, I skimmed over most of NKS). We don't plan to be founded in a single unifying principle based on cell automata (which might or might not be a differentiator, I really don't know - I can see how this could allow Alpha to have a more interesting evolution path), and we will be entirely in the open (which I think is a qualitative difference, as it allows for very different patterns). I am deeply impressed by Stephen's work, and try to follow it.

NKS and Wolfram's recent fundamental physics projects are a different story. I was thinking of his work on the Wolfram Language, including Wolfram Alpha but also Mathematica. There's a lot of computationally accessible knowledge about the world in those systems.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Denny Vrandečić</span> Read that arXiv paper. Really interesting ideas. An ambitious project, but as you say it's doable with today's technology. What I can't see from that technical paper is: who needs to be convinced to make it happen?<br/><br/>The core task of Wikilambda is rendering knowledge in various languages, and that part is well described. There are occasional hints at other use cases, which seem to imply that you end up creating a new programming language, although I don't see it said explicitly. It isn't very clear either what features that language will have, other than that it's purely functional. The example on page 9 suggests that it will have a type system that allows the type "positive_integer". Which in turn suggests that type checking will be dynamic, as you can rarely ever prove statically that the result of a computation is positive. But none of that is explicit.<br/><br/>What caught my attention in particular is: "Wikilambda would also offer a place where scientists and analysts could create models together, and share specifications, standards, or tests for functions." That happens to be the domain of my own "Future of Coding" project (<a href="https://github.com/khinsen/leibniz">https://github.com/khinsen/leibniz</a>), so I'd love to learn more about this. In particular, sharing specifications requires a specification language, not just a programming language, but nothing else in the paper hints at this being an objective. Since the most powerful scientific models we have are specifications rather than algorithms, it's an important point.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span> thanks for the links to Leibniz! That looks very interesting. I hope to avoid to create a new programming language, but to get away with composition of existing functions. The functions themselves can be implemented in any programming language the system supports, and whereas we will start only with one or two languages, we hope to considerably expand that.<br/>Types such as positive integer would be defined by the community, just as functions are. But no, it doesn't require dynamic checks, and in fact I expect most checks to be static - it just means that you'd either have underflows and overflows, or that you define your functions accordingly (i.e. natural subtract instead of subtraction). So, no new programming language, but yes to composition. The prototype implementation at <a href="https://github.com/google/abstracttext/">https://github.com/google/abstracttext/</a> might be helpful to dive further.<br/>Regarding the scientists to share models together, the thinking is more about "here's an executable version of that function we defined here", less about actually doing reasoning over the models itself. I am also not very sure how well this would work with an infrastructure as Wikilambda - probably something that is more geared towards such use cases such as leibniz would fare better. If I understand it right, you are doing a slightly different, higher level work of actually capturing and working with the whole model, whereas Wikilambda only wants to execute functions with specific inputs. Having said that, I would love to see how these two spaces could interact, I sense there is a lot of potential there - but it's not an area I have fully thought through.<br/>Those are great comments and pointers, thank you! If I didn't ask a question properly, fee free to ask again. Or if you have more questions.

Thanks for the pointer to the code, together with <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Wikipedia">https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Wikipedia</a> that fills in some blanks! You actually use the term "abstract programming language", which sounds fitting.<br/><br/>Basically your abstract programming language is a data model and a function composition model. The data model seems to be a slight extension of JSON though I wonder about some details, in particular number semantics. JSON only specifies number syntax, to which JavaScript adds floating-point semantics, which I think is a bad choice. The function composition model seems to be basically eager evaluation, but I wonder if there is a mechanism for error handling, which I'd expect to be practically necessary, though not in principle. Type checking would also have to be a part of the function composition model, and I guess that implies choosing a uniform type system (nominal vs. structural, parametricity, ...).<br/><br/>As for scientific models, I'd say their place is data structures in Wikidata, not functions in Wikilambda. That doesn't preclude having associated executable code for illustration, running demos, etc. BTW, that's how Leibniz is implemented in Racket. It's not code that compiles to functions, but an embedded data language that compiles to a few data structures representing symbols, terms, rules, and equations. I could easily map the data structures to Wikidata and write Wikilambda functions for rendering. Which might actually make sense one day, though my immediate use case is doing research, rather than documenting scientific concensus in Wikipedia.<br/><br/>BTW, I wonder if you know about Unison (<a href="https://www.unisonweb.org/">https://www.unisonweb.org/</a>), which has some overlap with your idea for Wikilambda as well, in particular the separation of the actual code from the identifiers that name pieces of code and data. That leads to a rather different development workflow, which may be adapted to Wikilambda as well.

Thank you for the rich comment! We don't use the number semantics from JSON nor the floating point extension from JS, but either must be a new type created by the community. So numbers in the prototype are literally strings with the base 10 representation (but then get converted for the actual evaluation). But in the end, the type system for numbers will be created by the community, it is not a core part.  The prototype evaluates mostly lazy for the composed functions, only for the parts implemented in a different programming language it may be eager. That's a little bit fishy still, to be honest, and one of the pieces that could benefit from more scrutiny.  There is error handling, as e.g. for division by zero, or for stack overflows, etc.  The type system is nominal. In the prototype it is not parametric, but that's no good, we will make it parametric for the next implementation. The current state of the function model is here: <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Wikipedia/Function_model">https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Wikipedia/Function_model</a>

Regarding scientific models, this all sounds good. Happy to see this grow closer together through Wikidata and Wikilambda in the future!

I remember having read the Unison webpage a while ago, but will take another look. Thank you for the reference!

Thanks for the Unison pointer, that was really interesting, and I can see the similarities on a number of interesting vectors, but not on others. Very cool!
