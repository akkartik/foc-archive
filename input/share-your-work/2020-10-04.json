It's clearly an embarrassment that, for a programmer to specify a vector, often all they can do is write eg vec2(2.9,4.4), when clearly that should be specified with the mouse (and a transform\/dual quaternion should be specified with a VR controller!). The same is true of a function curve.\n\nHowever, I agree with the criticism many have of Bret Victor\/GRAIL\/MaxMSP-style visual programming that they use mouse\/drag-and-drop too much. The problem of \"choose what the program does\" almost always means \"scroll to this point in execution, choose a function and some variables, and apply that\". That is best done with a keyboard that impacts a carat. The number of variables and functions available to you is large enough that if you try to pick them from a menu, it'll take much longer than typing the name, and you'll be more likely to click the wrong thing.\n\nI've considered having \"click on this variable in the display window and its name is pasted at your carat\", which is partway towards drag and drop. But I've never felt the need for that while using the system, so I might never implement that!\n\nIndeed for the purpose you describe I was thinking about a toggle-able \"just show me the names\" mode. It might turn out to be unnecessary though!",

                                "text": "Gotcha. First I'll say that I do like Bret Victor, and a lot of this is inspired by his work. It's clearly an embarrassment that, for a programmer to specify a vector, often all they can do is write eg vec2(2.9,4.4), when clearly that should be specified with the mouse (and a transform\/dual quaternion should be specified with a VR controller!). The same is true of a function curve.\n\nHowever, I agree with the criticism many have of Bret Victor\/GRAIL\/MaxMSP-style visual programming that they use mouse\/drag-and-drop too much. The problem of \"choose what the program does\" almost always means \"scroll to this point in execution, choose a function and some variables, and apply that\". That is best done with a keyboard that impacts a carat. The number of variables and functions available to you is large enough that if you try to pick them from a menu, it'll take much longer than typing the name, and you'll be more likely to click the wrong thing.\n\nI've considered having \"click on this variable in the display window and its name is pasted at your carat\", which is partway towards drag and drop. But I've never felt the need for that while using the system, so I might never implement that!\n\nIndeed for the purpose you describe I was thinking about a toggle-able \"just show me the names\" mode. It might turn out to be unnecessary though!"
