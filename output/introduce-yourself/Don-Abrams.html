Howdy everyone, I'm an American living in Paris very interested in democratizing the development of apps and programs. My current controversial opinions/hypotheses are that in most companies design and product really do most of the "programming" (but little of the coding), developers have developed internal models of the subsets of Turing machines that behave well but we haven't made those explicit, and category theory may provide a useful way to model programs and guarantee properties under composition (but currently feels primarily descriptive).
