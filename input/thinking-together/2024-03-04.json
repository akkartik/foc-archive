Journal editors spend much of their time finding reviewers for submissions. It happens that a submission is so exciting that people volunteer to review it, but that's the exception. The typical situation is journal editors contacting people they know (or strongly suspect) to be competent in the domain, and a small percentage of the contacted people agreeing.
