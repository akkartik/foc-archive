I'm a mathematician of a similar age as <@U6KQ2S410> and have programmed since the tail end of the punched card era, mostly at a low level - digging myself upwards from designing and building assemblers, debuggers, compilers, and interpreters to graphical editors (2D and 3D), to web design (frontend and backend).\n\nI taught Maths and then Computer Science at a Cambridge, UK sixth form and saw the introduction of the BBC Micro. This led me eventually to quitting teaching and writing software for the first ARM-based computer (the Acorn Archimedes) having borrowed one for a weekend to port the virtual machine for an APL interpreter (which could also run on the BBC Micro).\n\nThe (minimal) original website for my company is still up and running (<http:\/\/www.acecomp.demon.co.uk\/>) and there's a brief mention of some earlier work on the Binary Dinosaurs site (<http:\/\/www.binarydinosaurs.co.uk\/Museum\/icl\/tcheal.php>). My company merged with two other small UK software houses who produced a HyperCard-like programming system (Genesis) for the Archimedes. I am currently employed by an NLP specialist - designing a new web-based front-end for their product. I have also recently been teaching CS again, now that the UK syllabus has returned to something more like the one I taught in the 1980s.\n\nI have been working on attempts to improve programming itself for about 25 years, mostly due to a random thought in about 1993 which means I can no longer program without thinking \"This could be a lot easier...\" every time I hit a key. I've set myself a deadline for September to produce something a bit more public, as a self-imposed incentive. I've probably now gone down most dead-ends, so I'm hoping that failure experience will eventually pay off.",
