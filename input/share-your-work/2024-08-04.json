Yes, there are several solutions for structured\/constrained\/guided generation, but all of the ones I've seen base the structure validation either on regex or context-free grammars.

I don't think the solutions I've seen offer good support for something like that, but it would be fairly trivial with Levlo.\n\nI haven't really tried structures with free arbitrary text beyond just generated names, but I would imagine either prompting the LLM to only generate arbitrary text of certain length (as in \"a paragraph\", \"couple sentences\") or using appropriate length in samples would work. Have you tried? I suppose a potential challenge could be to make the LLM understand which part of the structure you mean with the length instructions in prompt, but I would be surprised if a dozen or so samples wouldn't work.
