Really these are all these same thing: specification, and the thing that builds \/ transforms it. The only difference is when &amp; where that happens. Really it's all just functions + data, so my idea is to just put it all in the same place and compose \/ separate \/ invoke the different pieces in the right order.",

Really these are all these same thing: specification, and the thing that builds \/ transforms it. The only difference is when &amp; where that happens. Really it's all just functions + data, so my idea is to just put it all in the same place and compose \/ separate \/ invoke the different pieces in the right order.",

Usually I think of compositionality as a purely functional matter without taking performance into account. For example, <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5l2wMgm7ZOk> discusses how compositionality tends to break down once performance constraints enter the picture (rather than that compositionality causes bad performance).\n\nSo I'm with Shalabh that the two ideas seem orthogonal. A bare-bones design can very easily be non-composable. A great design can seem _very_ composable, particularly within its area of control (i.e. if people only do what the designer anticipated).\n\nIn the end, the knife-edge the designer has to walk is between good design and totalizing design. You have to provide a good environment for use. But if you _take control_ of the environment you'll eventually hamstring yourself.",
