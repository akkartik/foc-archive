If you tell them \"Please call Mary and tell her that Tom wants to meet her at 8PM\", the assistant would probably ask which 'Tom' you meant and would assume that the time was referring to your current time zone. Using the additional information, the assistant could inform Mary (assuming that 'Mary' is unambiguous). If they'd just do the call (without asking for clarification), Mary would have to guess the exact meaning of 'Tom' and the time.\n\nIn programming we're guessing and working around ambiguity issues all the time and I wonder if another storage representation could solve this."
