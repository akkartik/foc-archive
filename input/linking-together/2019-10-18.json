I can imagine that Safari browser is the millions of lines of code.  The problem is that massive redundancy occurs because programmers cannot connect interchangeable parts, but instead keep importing packages, which duplicate sub-functions over and over. I would wager that 90% of Safari is  effectively duplicated code.",
