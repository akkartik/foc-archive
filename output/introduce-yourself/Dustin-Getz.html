Hello, I’m the CEO of <a href="http://www.hyperfiddle.net/">http://www.hyperfiddle.net/</a> which is a FOC startup currently based in Philadelphia. Hyperfiddle basically takes the Clojure/Datomic information model and extends it through to user interfaces. While the technology is interesting, we think a large part of the work is forming a strategy to get adoption at scale (a smooth path from 0 to 1 to 100 to 100k) and also figuring out an economic model to fund the work.<br/><br/>We are bullish on Clojure because Clojure satisfies the criteria of “smooth adoption path” and has a lot of deeply interesting properties, such as the cost of porting Clojure to a new platform is within about a man-year of effort. Clojure on N platforms makes it possible to build distributed systems across platforms with shared information model, data structures and code. A unified/holistic model. So while Clojure is certainly not perfect, it is designed for real-world usage and makes practical compromises to achieve growth. We see Hyperfiddle as just one component of a self-organizing movement which is larger than any one project or company funding 100% of the work.
