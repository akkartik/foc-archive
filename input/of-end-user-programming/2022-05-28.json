Are you not happy with what you got and are willing to get your hands little dirty -- then go on and open the case! Buy a thing or two, exchange components, get a better thing than what you started with. You don't need to know ins and outs of transistors to do this. If it got the right port then just plug and play. Majority of people will not do this, but for many it is way simpler than buying a new machine or have an expert do it for you. (Some companies will not like you if you want to do this with their machine.)\n\nSimilarly, you do not need to know about how code works if the systems are compatible. Just break the one you have, exchange parts, pull it together, and run. Is it surprising that such features are not widely available? There is an incentive for companies to have their software closed and open source cannot agree on a common approach. No attempt for standardization can change this. There is just too many people to persuade and too many companies that do not want it. We would need to see an analogy for the right-to-repair in movement in software.
