<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Antranig Basman</span>'s paper on ownable software (<a href="https://github.com/amb26/papers/blob/master/ppig-2018/What_Lies_in_the_Path_of_the_Revolution.pdf">https://github.com/amb26/papers/blob/master/ppig-2018/What_L&hellip;</a>) at <a href="https://futureprogramming.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1543675875029600?thread_ts=1543666652.029200&amp;cid=C5T9GPWFL">https://futureprogramming.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1543&hellip;</a> really deserves its own thread. This is fantastic.<br/><br/>The notion of a program addition operator for arbitrary code is a huge open research problem. Consider my research plan as an alternative: changing software development <em>customs</em> to make comprehensibility a first-class design consideration, and giving up on black-box composition in favor of a more white-box approach where the community adapting some piece of comprehensible software for its own needs is willing to take on ownership for code they didn't write, and to mess with its guts as needed.<br/><br/>It will require more people to be willing to learn programming. In exchange you'd be able to start now (soonish, once I come up with tools to help migrate code between divergent forks) rather than wait for a technological breakthrough.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I've been focused on the technical challenges and hadn't scoped out their implications on the eco-system in quite so much detail. This is <em>super</em> useful, thank you very much for doing this work.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Antranig Basman</span> the ideals you talk about in that paper are ones that I’m keen to explore and experiment with. A system that I once worked on made a concerted effort on the side shared datasets that others can build on top of. This paper is perhaps the most succinct description of it: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dominic_Widdows/publication/228403010_Distributed_knowledge_representation_using_universal_identity_and_replication/links/0912f509937ef9541f000000.pdf">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dominic_Widdows/publica&hellip;</a><br/><br/>but there are other later ones that discuss some of the apps we built on top of it, including one for visualizing wildlife sightings

Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Joe Trellick</span>, the Widdows et al. link is very interesting, and makes a good stab at one of the most difficult problems, of building ontologies retroactively which previously I'd only seen tackled by "Semprola", Oli Sharpe's system which I mentioned in the other thread. I'd like to get some more technical detail on how the "roles" system is implemented and interpreted in practice, and perhaps even some source code : P The "noms" project seems to concentrate on the less interesting part of the problem, that is, how can we assure the integrity and availability of the data, the problem subset that we see tackled, for example, in the current incarnation of the "Dat" project - <a href="https://datproject.org/">https://datproject.org/</a> . It's great that our case studies also focus on visualizing wildlife sightings, got a few links to those followup papers?

Thanks for the kind words on the paper, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> - indeed as you suggest, a program addition operator for arbitrary code is not workable, under the "black box" model. This is why we propose the abolition of program code as currently constituted - you can check out the parallel paper at <a href="https://github.com/amb26/papers/raw/master/onward-2016/onward-2016.pdf">https://github.com/amb26/papers/raw/master/onward-2016/onward-2016.pdf</a> on the "Open Authorial Principle" for positive and negative constraints on how this replacement for code will need to be organised. Indeed it must operate on the "white box" principles you suggest - also note section 5.4 which explains that our program algebra is not like others which have been proposed, in being primarily decompositional rather than compositional. The OAP I think offers helpful economics and models of how the adopting community can "mess with the guts" of adopted artefacts whilst i) maintaining a relationship with the upstream community, ii) not necessarily disrupting the upstream community's artefacts.<br/>Indeed comprehensibility is a key virtue underpinning all authorial activities, an important prerequisite of which is visibility/addressibility.<br/>I should stop saying "indeed" but my 2-yr-old son has recently adopted it as an idiom from his favorite TV character, Flop.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Antranig Basman</span> I just read your OAP paper, and the problem it expresses of modifying internal program structure slotted in neatly with thought experiments I’ve been pondering about how one might express programs using immutable pieces in a content-addressable store. (Let’s imagine that each function is named by a hash of its contents.)<br/><br/>Such a system would feel so tedious to edit directly that you’d gravitate towards the existence of a “patching” system, where you could express something like “system A, but everywhere function B is referenced, use function C instead” and so on.<br/><br/>(One fun aspect to consider: if the thing you’re referencing is immutable, does the Law of Demeter still have teeth?)<br/><br/>I know Unison is exploring content-addressable functions, I still need to learn more about their approach.

Or you may end up creating functions with lots of optional args for hooks to influence their behavior.<br/><br/>Functions would end up being large and doing more to make hooks economic.<br/><br/>So that's two more 'rules of taste' being violated. I'm sure there'll be others.<br/><br/>All these violations seem like a red flag. Code should be malleable. Making code immutable feels like abuse, going against the grain of its fundamental nature.<br/><br/>Maybe there's value is making certain timeless functions immutable and giving them hashes. Substring search? Blowfish? Especially if you're providing some hard-to-provide property like resistance to timing attacks. But <em>true</em> timelessness is really hard. Even with substring search you end up caring about how strings are represented. Length-prefixed? Null-terminated? You also have the problem of picking the right platform to represent a timeless function in. None of our existing platforms seem good enough. Maybe we need a new VM that lots of new languages build on and share a vocabulary over. Maybe WebAssembly is that platform?<br/><br/>It may also make sense in a more restricted environment where users can't create first-class functions. Like say a library of stored procedures in your database. But at that point it seems more like an implementation detail of one particular system.

Interesting <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span>, though we may be thinking of different things. I’m conceiving of content-addressable functions as a means of versioning/distribution—I believe Joe Armstrong has flirted with similar ideas in “Why do we need modules at all?” The goal of the OAP paper is I believe to make things more editable, not less

I don't see immutability as against malleability because all we are really saying is the specific version is immutable, but new versions are possible. E.g. a git repo uses immutable chunks but is still an evolving system. We really want something like git that tracks functions and types directly (instead of tracking files), if I understand <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Joe Trellick</span> correctly. The cross-function links would point to specific versions of functions (not just to a function by name), so if you commit a new version of a function F@2, nothing really changes, but you can then selectively/automatically commit new versions of dependent functions to point to your new version F@2 instead of F@1. Separately you'd want this as single global auto-replicated repository that everyone can commit to because updates don't interfere with each other by default, people chose which updates affect their <tt>main</tt> functions.<br/><br/>The more interesting question is: do we want functions and types as the unit of update - or something finer/coarser grained? The OAP uses the term 'expression' but doesn't say what exactly this is.

Interesting. If everyone is adding versions willy nilly, what does having a single global monorepo for the world buy us? What problem is it solving? I guess I'm not seeing the connection to OAP. I should read the paper first..

The connection is just that a system that tracks versioned entities and their inter-connections might be well suited to store the 'expressions' (as individual entities) of an OAP based system. The hard problem of OAP, as I see it, is figuring out what exactly these expressions are. I was thinking a spreadsheet follows the OAP to some degree - each cell is a named expression and can be overwritten by any other author. Perhaps notebooks (<a href="http://observablehq.com">observablehq.com</a>) are also closer to the spirit of OAP than typical code.

I just encountered <a href="https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/limbo-scaling-software-collaboration-afd4f00db4b">https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/limbo-scaling-software-col&hellip;</a>, which seems relevant.<br/><br/>&gt; Limbo is live, shared programming. It balances precariously between two principles:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * Everyone is working on (and production is executing) the same program, represented by a single abstract syntax tree.<br/>&gt; * No one is allowed to cause others (including users) problems.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The changes that propagate through Limbo are transformations of the abstract syntax tree [not raw text].
