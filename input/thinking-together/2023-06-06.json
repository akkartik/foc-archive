I've built these tools to give the artists plenty of rope to hang themselves (and our customers) with, but also the adequate context, training, documentation, and features to make it so that the benefits vastly outweigh the risks and occasional mishaps. (And I, the senior programmer, also occasionally ship something that has avoidable bugs. My programming ability doesn't save me from being fallible, heh)"
