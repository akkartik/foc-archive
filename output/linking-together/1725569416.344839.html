Looking at SPLASH '24 program, I knew <a href="https://liveprog.org">LIVE</a> workshop is always very relevant (this year majority of lectures involve folks here); but also found <a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/series/paint">PAINT</a> which sounds great too :eyes:<br/>> In the workshop on Programming Abstractions and Interactive Notations, Tools, and Environments (PAINT), we want to discuss programming environments that support users in working with and creating notations and abstractions that matter to them. We are interested in the relationship between people centric notations and general-purpose programming languages and environments. How do we reflect the various experiences, needs, and priorities of the many people involved in programming — whether they call it that or not?<br/>> Areas of interest to PAINT include but are not limited to:<br/>> • Design and implementation of program representations and their means of interaction for end-users of all ages<br/>> • Design and implementation of visual programming environments<br/>> • Block-based environments and their application<br/>> • Projectional editors and their application<br/>> • Languages and their environments with mixed notations<br/>> • Meta tools or tool creation frameworks<br/>> • Methods to support working with abstractions, such as example-based programming<br/>> • Input and output devices for interacting with programming environments<br/>> • Theories of the above<br/>PAINT format is flipped, kinda critical review, and not recorded IIUC.  But the past papers look interesting.
