        "text": "I'm researching the history of extensions in text editors (e.g., like VSCode extensions <https:\/\/marketplace.visualstudio.com\/>). I generally consider TextMate (released 2004) as the starting point of an era of text editors built around extensions. That for example makes Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code all \"TextMate-likes\" in that their built around significant amount of functionality coming from share-able extensions. (Note that I'm making a distinction between *extensible text editors*, à la Emacs, and *text editor extensions* that are easily share-able packages\/plugins\/bundles, etc...)\n\nOther note-able milestones in the text-editor-extension era are the introduction of Pathogen.vim for Vim in 2008 and Package.el added to Emacs 24 in 2011. Light Table and Atom, released in 2012 and 2014 respectively, are also notable as the first popular web-based text editor built around extensions. Being web-based greatly increased the ease of writing extensions that involve GUI elements.\n\nI'm curious to hear about what others consider important milestones for extensions in text editors? For example, I'd love to hear more about any prior art to TextMate? Before package managers for Vim and Emacs, how did people share syntax highlighting files? And were there examples in other text editors that went beyond syntax highlighting, e.g., did any text editors prior to 2004 have a plugin system that could do more than just add syntax highlighting, like adding commands?",

That for example makes Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code all \"TextMate-likes\" in that their built around significant amount of functionality coming from share-able extensions.

Light Table and Atom, released in 2012 and 2014 respectively, are also notable as the first popular web-based text editor built around extensions. Being web-based greatly increased the ease of writing extensions that involve GUI elements.\n\nI'm curious to hear about what others consider important milestones for extensions in text editors? For example, I'd love to hear more about any prior art to TextMate? Before package managers for Vim and Emacs, how did people share syntax highlighting files? And were there examples in other text editors that went beyond syntax highlighting, e.g., did any text editors prior to 2004 have a plugin system that could do more than just add syntax highlighting, like adding commands?"
