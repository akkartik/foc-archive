Hi everyone!<br/><br/>My name is Miguel Rochefort. I'm a software developer from Montréal, Canada. I've been traveling around Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Bali) for the past 6 months out of my 21-liter backpack.<br/><br/>I initially got into programming at age 10, when I built my first websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). At 12, I started played with Python and C++. At 16, it was Visual Basic and PHP. At 18, I started learning C#, which has been my main language for the past 10 years. I then discovered Haskell, Prolog, Lisp, Smalltalk, ML, Agda, Idris, Coq, Mercury, Eve, etc. That's when I got hooked on programming language design.<br/><br/>My main influences are Bret Victor, Alan Kay, Douglas Engelbart, Chris Granger, Ted Nelson, Tim Berners Lee, Jef Raskin, Steve Jobs, Stephen Wolfram, Charles Simonyi, David Allen, Mathias Duarte, etc. If I could travel back in time, I would go to Xerox PARC.<br/><br/>The current state of software is a mess. The incidental complexity is unbelievable. Nothing changed in the past 40 years. We must have reached a local maxima.<br/><br/>Here are some of my heuristics for the future of programming:<br/><br/>- Using software and creating software should feel the same.<br/>- 80% of people should be able to program without any formal training.<br/>- You should be productive when programming on a 5" phone (but the optimal interface should be VR or R).<br/>- Programming should not involve text files and syntax.<br/>- Programming by example (with direct manipulation) should be the dominant paradigm (WYSIWYG, TDD, ML dataset, Excel's Flash Fill).<br/>- The distinction between natural language, programming language and graphical user interface should disappear.<br/>- Programming is mainly a modeling problem.<br/>- Designing and implementing GUI by hand doesn't scale (especially once responsive design considers all of a user's preferences) and should be automated (e.g., Naked Objects).<br/>- The code to invoke a user (GUI) and the code to invoke a machine (API) should be identical.<br/>- Every function/predicate/model ever created should be instantly available to everyone.<br/>- Mechnical turks and AI functions should be as easy to call as a local function.<br/>- Fuzzy/bayesian values (e.g., "integer between 0 and 18") should be first class citizens, and automatically turn any deterministic functions into a fuzzy/probabilistic functions.<br/>- Strings should be avoided, and semantically richer types/ontologies (Email, PhoneNumber, Password, Country) should be used instead.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm experimenting with Quantified Self. I'm trying to collect as much information about my life as I can. This starts with IoT devices, wearables, NFC tags, QR codes, cameras, audio recorders, GPS trackers, keyloggers, IFTTT, manual input, etc. Then I have to manually/automatically classify/quantify the collected data, to extract computable meaning/semantics. Ultimately, I can visualize the data, query it, infer new knowledge, make lifestyle changes to affect the output, etc. The idea is that the more we know about a user, the less we need to ask it for input ("don't make me click") and the less assumptions about it we need to hard code in our code base. I believe this is the first step to make coding against a user as easy as coding against an API or a database.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to some great discussions!

Hi Miguel :wave:<br/>&gt; - Every function/predicate/model ever created should be instantly available to everyone.<br/>That'd be really cool!

Welcome to the club.  I'd like to see more analysis over every function/predicate/model ever.  What patterns are we not even aware of?

Welcome! I think you'll find a ton of overlap between your "heuristics" and those of ours. I hope we can exchange some good insights

“Right now, I’m experimenting with Quantified Self. I’m trying to collect as much information about my life as I can. This starts with IoT devices, wearables, NFC tags, QR codes, cameras, audio recorders, GPS trackers, keyloggers, IFTTT, manual input, etc. ” I like this line of thinking. I actually tried something similar and ended up putting the approach on its head.<br/><br/>Now, I actually use a daily Excel spreadsheet that I reshape constantly. This no-doubt has some limitations, but it’s helped me be more concrete and think really hard about how to re-structure my data as I want to increase the useful data-collection territory.<br/><br/>When I was playing with more passive / background data collection with the sensors I had at home, it was harder to iterate on the shape of the data, the view I was presented it, etc. I’ve used this Excel approach to cut a few habits out of my life :slightly_smiling_face:
