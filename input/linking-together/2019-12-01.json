        "text": "> My motivation was always to create a general-purpose programming language that would solve all problems and be interpreted, but fast.\n> \n> I much preferred implementing and coding in LISP, but once I was dealing with big data sets and then having to do fairly simple calculations, APL just seemed to have the better vocabulary.\n> \n> It had to come up one level. Common LISP even then had about 2,000 primitives. I didn't like that. What I liked was the original LISP, which had car, cdr, cons, and cond, but that was too little. Common LISP was way too big, but a stripped-down version of APL was in the middle with about 50 operations. It's about the same size as C. But the thing about the languages that I implement is that *there are no libraries: those 50 operations are it. Everybody builds from there, and the resulting programs are extremely short.*\n-- Arthur Whitney, creator of J and K (<https:\/\/queue.acm.org\/detail.cfm?id=1531242>)",

Common LISP even then had about 2,000 primitives. I didn't like that. What I liked was the original LISP, which had car, cdr, cons, and cond, but that was too little. Common LISP was way too big, but a stripped-down version of APL was in the middle with about 50 operations. It's about the same size as C. But the thing about the languages that I implement is that "
