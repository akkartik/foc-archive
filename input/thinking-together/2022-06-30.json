For example, spreadsheets are often used to simulate and communicate information about projected earnings and expenses. One person creates a spreadsheet that embodies a certain model of how the organization works and certain predictions about what is likely to happen. They then give it to another person, who can explore the model and see what it predicts if different choices are made or different events occur in the near future.\n\nWhat type of literacy it supports depends on the medium. Spreadsheets have probably done a lot to improve financial literacy. Video games have helped many people to understand how virtual combat systems work.

Physics simulations help people to better understand Newtonian physics in an intuitive way, and to make fewer Aristotelian assumptions.\n\nUltimately, once we have a dynamic medium that anyone can use to express their ideas, meaning a personal dynamic medium, it may support deeper thinking about processes and systems in general.\n\nPersonally, although I don't think it will happen in our lifetime, I like to hope that it will ultimately make us smarter all the way around and help us to understand and solve our really big problems, like poverty, pollution, corruption, and war.",
