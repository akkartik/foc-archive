Hello everyone! I'm curious in the sense of "thinking together"   regarding this happening in the rust community: <a href="https://twitter.com/etorreborre/status/1463422189080915969?s=20">https://twitter.com/etorreborre/status/1463422189080915969?s=20</a> what are you throughts in it? Why is it happening  within the rust community and more general? How much are programming languages influenced in terms of communicating culture by things like the culture wars? Looking forward to your thoughts

My 2Â¢:<br/>&gt; what are you throughts in it?<br/>&gt; <br/>That's it's kind of pointless to conjecture any useful thoughts around it given that the actual details of what happened to prompt this haven't been shared publicly. Those who are seem to mostly be using it as a soapbox to espouse some pre-established opinion.<br/>&gt; Why is it happening within the rust community and more general?<br/>&gt; <br/>Because squabbles over governance and control happen in every community, always have and probably always will. We're a species with a deep seated desire/need to establish social hierarchies and that shows up in every group.

As a professional Rubyist and taster of all others, I do feel feedback between culture and library design especially with language design lagging (since languages naturally change more slowly).  For example, Ruby libraries consistently choose simplicity over completeness and soundness.  Contrast with, say, Haskell where it may be hard to express what I want, but I always come away understanding what exactly is hard better.
