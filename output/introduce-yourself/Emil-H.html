Greetings from Gothenburg, Sweden! I started coding in Amiga Basic as a 10-year old, and professionally since 2000, mostly web, C++ and graphics. Although I always loved programming, I also always strongly felt that there has to be a better way than the status quo. Frustratingly, my teachers, colleagues &amp; peers didn't seem to care. When I finally found Bret Victor's work, it felt like a huge validation - "I'm not alone, I'm not crazy, someone else gets it too!"<br/><br/>Consumed the Future of Coding site in "read-only mode" for years (thanks for the great content, Steve!), but I didn't join the community in read-write mode until now that I have something substantial to contribute - coming soon in the #share-your-work channel.<br/><br/>Interested in everything, but with a special focus on:<br/><li> Visualization - as in revealing the shape and size of abstract things clearly, <em>not</em> just giving bar charts a sci-fi look<br/><li> User interface design - really unhappy with current mainstream trends, UIs ought to empower users rather than dumbing things down<br/><li> Pipe dreaming of redesigning OSes, the internet and the web stack from scratch with the benefit of hindsight<br/><li> ... but also charting realistic incremental improvements<br/><li> Green/environmental issues - neither hardware nor CPU cycles are free, make sure they carry their weight
