You had to pay huge sums to them - effectively ransom money - for access to the applications that allowed access to each type of data they would let you manage: maybe payroll, maybe accounts, etc.\n\nIf you didn't pay up, your data was essentially lost. And you certainly wouldn't be able to cross-link your payroll or accounts data with data in any competitor's applications.\n\nSo maybe this was a driver to Smalltalk's particular model of an \"OS with no applications\" - the desire to restore to primacy the precious users' data. Without applications, you just had all different types of data available to you, all visible and interactable in the GUI, to mash up how you liked.\n\nThose chunks of different types of data were called \"objects\", of course. Kay's objects had methods or messages on the outside - the API - and held data on the inside, inaccessible directly to other objects. So in a way, they were like \"mini-Blobs\" - they still wrapped the precious data, but at least that data was no longer beyond a user's access or control.\n\nNow, my claim is that this was \"almost there but not quite\", at least if we're talking about non-technical users, faced with the Smalltalk object model; if we want an \"OS without applications\" that \"normies\" can use - one that makes their data first class over the rather difficult code.\n\nWhat's missing is what I call \"The Inversion\". The Inversion is the dramatic choice point that moves you from Imperative to Declarative style.\n\nIf the goal of an \"OS without applications\" is to free our data - to restore its primacy in the user's experience - then it's a shame to give up at the last hurdle! Why not go all the way and make data truly first class - all the way down to those little objects? Why not de-Blob the objects too?\n\nJust put the data on the *outside*, and *hide the behaviour*! That's The Inversion: \"What not How\".\n\nIt was still the 1970s when an application was released that did acknowledge the power of the Inversion: Visicalc. With Visicalc you saw the data in your spreadsheet cells before the functions behind them. But the Smalltalk and Visicalc models were never merged into \"an OS without applications for non-techies\".\n\nWhich is what the Object Network and OnexOS are doing, right now!",

But the Smalltalk and Visicalc models were never merged into \"an OS without applications for non-techies\".\n\nWhich is what the Object Network and OnexOS are doing, right now!"
