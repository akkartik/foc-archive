<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Drewverlee</span> // disclaimer, dont take my words as gossip but I think I can help some<br/><br/>1. yes, when Milewski says “set” he is referring to a mathematical set (math-set) and not the data structure set (programming-set) we use in programming. there is overlap in an intuitive (hand wavy) understanding of these two definitions math-set and programming-set. BUT! in math-set you would not delete a element like you would in programming-set. some concrete examples: an ex of a math-set is <tt>all integers</tt> and a programming-set is <tt>["a","b","c"]</tt>.<br/><br/>2. here, when we start talking about functions on sets we are more in group (etc) theory in my mind. Take the math-set of <tt>all integers</tt>, there are many (infinite) functions that take this set back to itself. one function, call it <tt>f</tt> we define to be <tt>a + b</tt> where <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are any elements in our set of <tt>all integers</tt>. so <tt>f</tt> is a function that maps <tt>all integers</tt> to <tt>all integers</tt> because any a+b will give us a result that exists in our set! (this is similar to the moment where Milewski talks about how element of groups are always compossible). you can see that this <tt>f</tt> is NOT the identity function for our set despite it being a function that maps the set to itself. <b>this is an example of what I think Milewski means when you can have functions that “interchange” elements on sets and the answer to your question</b>. back to the identity function. Im not sure how operations play a role here... is <tt>a + 0</tt> the identity function in the category theory sense? what about <tt>a * 1</tt>?<br/><br/>Hope this helps or maybe prompts new questions :stuck_out_tongue:

I hide the fact that a math-set could very well be a finite set of things. futhermore that `["a", "b", "c"]` is a completely valid math-set. BUT you would not delete an item on this math-set and have the “same set” like you would if you did: <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap"><br/>// javascript<br/>const myProgrammingSet = new Set();<br/>myProgrammingSet.add("a");<br/>myProgrammingSet.add("b");<br/>myProgrammingSet.delete("a");<br/>console.log(myProgrammingSet); // {"a"}</pre>
