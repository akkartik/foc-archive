This week in code faster, I wrote about a fairly simple technique, including ticket links in TODO comments (the same applies for bug workaround comments). What was weird is I wrote it in my head 5 times, then put it on paper, and realized half of it was a bunch of bikeshedding. Even something so simple is easy to get wrong. Writing is still a really slow process :/

I think writing good text is like writing a good computer program. You need to constantly iterate over the the text to get a meaningful and working result for your audience

I think it's a feature that writing is slow. It's the necessary bottleneck to add order, literally, to the heap of ideas we have. I see writing, and speaking, as forms of topological sorts on the graphs of ideas that our brains possess. I think it's precisely this sort/linearization part that's hard (like any sorting algorithm), but it's what forces some structure onto our thoughts.

Hour two of a three paragraph email, "Why is writing so hard?  After all this time, I can't even clearly..."  It's interesting how dialog differs from self-contained explanitory text.  I just mean that when writing in, say, Slack, you can say something ambiguous, confusing, and a person can ask for clarification if they're not on the same wavelength.
