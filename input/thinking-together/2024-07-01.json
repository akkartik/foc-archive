That's the reasonable default position.\n• If you're trying to change infrastructure and you don't understand why the existing infrastructure exists, you won't be effective at your aims.\n• On the other hand I can't discount Stefan Lesser's argument in favor of beginner's mind. It's just that I don't have beginner's mind, and I don't think it's something you can fake.\n• So what do I think we _should_ do? My current answer for myself is: use as little infrastructure as possible and try to build what you need atop that, just for yourself. If it's good, your personal infrastructure will also become infrastructure for others. If it's not, well that wasn't the goal.",
