&gt; All the other "in-*" channels are associated with cities.<br/>Why, allow me to direct you to my local channel: #in-alberta. Yep, I'm a fellow Canuck! I figured it would be worth broadening this current channel to cover all of Ontario, so that folks a little further north in the province (for instance) would feel welcome to participate in it. With #in-alberta, we have folks from Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and points beyond (like me â€” I'm super rural). While we do (or did, sigh) all our meetups in Calgary, the channel was meant to be inclusive of everyone in Alberta, so it's entirely possible that we might do a meetup in Edmonton if we get more members there, too.<br/><br/>So that's the thinking. If you'd like me to rename it back to #in-kitchener-waterloo I can, but I think there are downsides to splintering these location-specific channels up into too fine a granularity.<br/><br/>As for the Ontario, California overlap... it's such a bummer that "CA" is both the California state abbreviation AND the Canada country abbreviation, otherwise we could do #in-ontario-ca. If you're willing to keep the channel scope a little broader (so that we don't also end up with an #in-toronto at some point, say)... I'd love suggestions for what the name could be that strikes the right balance between being open to folks from a larger area, but not from across the continent due to namespace pollution.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, it's your channel! You get final say. I'm just trying to put on the "I'm new, do I feel welcome participating here?" goggles :P
