Last week, Ink &amp; Switch published the <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/crosscut/">Crosscut</a> essay, which describes our (<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Szymon Kaliski</span>, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Marcel Goethals</span>, and my) work on a prototype tool for drawing dynamic models of your thoughts. It's a fount of FoC-relevant ideas. For instance, combining <em>the place where the programming happens</em> with <em>the place where the program runs,</em> but even further <em>using the same tools for building and working inside the program.</em> Also, Crosscut tries to <em>not feel like programming</em>, and present a minimalist interface that is ruthlessly focused on emulating the best aspects of traditional pen &amp; paper. If you haven't taken the time to read the essay, you're.. probably busy, I shouldn't bother you, sorry. I'll just leave a note on the door.<br/><br/>Before working on Crosscut, I had been slowly chipping away at my own FoC project called <a href="https://ivanish.ca/hest-time-travel/">Hest</a> (yeah, still just that one blog post). I also made a podcast just to think out loud about the project, so that I could self-reflect and thus hone my ideas and goals, and maybe someday build another prototype. But when the Crosscut project started, it drew all my attention, and the podcast stopped.<br/><br/>Today, with Crosscut done and released to the world, I'm here to share a new Hest podcast episode — 46 minutes long — in which I compare and contrast Crosscut and Hest.<br/>• How are their prototypes similar and different?<br/>• What goals do they share and disagree on?<br/>• How has my work on Crosscut shaped my thoughts on visual programming generally?<br/>• What effect will that have as I continue pursuing Hest (or any other FoC projects)?<br/>To find out, kindly use <a href="https://ivanish.ca/hest.rss">this hand-crafted RSS feed</a>, search for <b>Hest</b> or <b>Ivan Reese</b> in your podcast player of choice, or click one of the buttons here: <a href="https://pod.link/1559446316">https://pod.link/1559446316</a><br/><br/>And stay tuned for more episodes. They won't be on a schedule, but they will be about as relevant and entertaining as this fine slack message. So, fifty-fifty, eh? ;)

Ok, I grok the Varignon parallelogram construction now. This is pretty :exploding_head: In particular, encapsulation without lamination levels up the debate around whether abstraction is good or bad.<br/><br/>One minor quibble: "encapsulation" is typically considered to turn things into "black boxes", which is the opposite of what's going on here.

I'd love better terminology than "encapsulation without lamination" — suggestions welcome!

Also, that parallelogram proof is borrowed from ThingLab. It's a great "Todo MVC" for dynamic drawing tools :)

Then again, it <em>is</em> black box w.r.t. meta ink. Just white box w.r.t. concrete points. I don't think there's a good existing term for this so what you chose is as good as any :slightly_smiling_face:

I loved that podcast and its great to run with someone else's perspective and constraints to see where it leads.
