hi everyone im <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-ripka/">nicole</a>! im an early stage investor based in ny at a really cool firm called betaworks. im also a photographer & curator & queer party thrower. i'm really enjoying this space and thankful for all of those sharing their work. you guys are inspiring me to build my own ideas. i'm recently enrolled in some courses at the school for poetic computation so hoping to have some work to share here soon. lastly, we're about to kick off this accelerator for folks building ai apps so maybe some of you here would like this. think the betaworks communtiy has alot of alignment with this one. if you want to learn more dm me:)
