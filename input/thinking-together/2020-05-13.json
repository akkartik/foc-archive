Check out how jetpack compose does this behind the scenes - <https:\/\/youtu.be\/Q9MtlmmN4Q0> - pretty cheap inserts in the UI tree, if that’s what you’re looking for. Not sure I understand the question.\n\nBut as far as I get it, your logic (observe, filter, map) is not UI related, so the UI could belong to any library , the logic is behind it. You could do that in Kotlin (Kotlin Flow), in Dart (RxDart and Freezed), in JS (Uhh RxJS &amp; Collections.JS if you wanna use a baked solution), most languages have their own implementation.",

Not sure I understand the question.\n\nBut as far as I get it, your logic (observe, filter, map) is not UI related, so the UI could belong to any library , the logic is behind it. You could do that in Kotlin (Kotlin Flow), in Dart (RxDart and Freezed), in JS (Uhh RxJS & Collections.JS if you wanna use a baked solution), most languages have their own implementation."

Thus, the distaste for bevels and drop shadows, seeing those things as superfluous eye candy rather than tools that designers can use to create meaning.\n\nHe built the patcher as a tool for non-programmers. My whole philosophy is: build a visual tool for expert programmers, where \"programmer\" is more of a way of thinking than a particular skillset.\n\nSo his inclination to reach for text and an imperative paradigm feels like a blind spot — and an unexpected one, considering he basically defined how most people conceive of visual programming.\n\nTo me, that's terrifying. We might have been better off if Max and Pd hadn't existed, and visual programming had instead been popularized by someone with a knack for visual communication.",

Thus, the distaste for bevels and drop shadows, seeing those things as superfluous eye candy rather than tools that designers can use to create meaning.\n\nHe built the patcher as a tool for non-programmers. My whole philosophy is: build a visual tool for expert programmers, where \"programmer\" is more of a way of thinking than a particular skillset.\n\nSo his inclination to reach for text and an imperative paradigm feels like a blind spot — and an unexpected one, considering he basically defined how most people conceive of visual programming.\n\nTo me, that's terrifying. We might have been better off if Max and Pd hadn't existed, and visual programming had instead been popularized by someone with a knack for visual communication."
