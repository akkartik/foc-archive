I'd be curious if writing code in your native language is a net plus or net minus. Plus, use words you like and are used to. Minus, 70-90% of the world can't look at your code. If your code looks like this<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">関数 距離（頂点ー、頂点二）｛<br/>　返す 平方根（足す（二乗（頂点ー）二乗（頂点二）））<br/>｝</pre><br/>Only people in your own language can read it. People not in that language can't even type it . If you ask for help you can only get that help from a much smaller set of people.<br/><br/>Also what do you do about libraries? Do you need a localized version of every library just so you can keep everything in your language?<br/><br/>Of course I say this as a "privileged" English speaker. I have no idea what I would feel like using all these languages that are generally based in English if I wasn't fluent in English.<br/><br/>Also, I don't know about China or Korea but as an example when non-ASCII domain names became possible lots of people in Japan though kanji based domain names would take off. They didn't though. It's been 15+ years since it was possible but almost no companies use them.
