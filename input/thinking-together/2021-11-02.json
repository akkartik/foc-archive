Files contain data, but don't have children. Folders have children, but can't store data themselves. What if a file system had \"nodes\" that could store data AND have children?\nI've written a blog post about this and would like to hear your thoughts. As I'm not a native speaker in English and not really talented in writing, I'd be interested in feedback regarding the content as well as the general writing style etc.. Thanks in advance and looking forward to interesting discussions!\n<https:\/\/fkohlgrueber.github.io\/blog\/tree-structure-of-file-systems\/>",

As I'm not a native speaker in English and not really talented in writing, I'd be interested in feedback regarding the content as well as the general writing style etc.. Thanks in advance and looking forward to interesting discussions!\n"
