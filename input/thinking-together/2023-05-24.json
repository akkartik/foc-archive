Why?\nAlmost surely not. It's a matter of complexity and scale. The average Atari 8 bit home computer video game cartridge is *8k*.  That's not just 8k code, that's 8k code, assets, the whole enchilada. Compare and contrast with _No Man's Sky_ which clocks in at 6 gigabytes! Admittedly the majority of this is assets, but I can only imagine the code size is quite a bit bigger than 8k.\n\nHow can a creature of such size and complexity possibly be more robust than &lt; 8k of lovingly hand crafted 6502 assembler?",

Modern progress and expectations have given game studios more opportunity to shoot themselves in the foot. I don't think that's a good enough argument for modern games being less robust. Hardware and tools are more robust than in 1980. Some of that, as performance always does, gets wasted and some of it goes into making better games.",
