Another one is that whenever you run it, it starts afresh and the internal state is reset. Identifying these might indicate room to explore for whatever other abstractions we design.",

The program is operated on from the 'outside' - you write it, run it etc. so there is other stuff outside of the program that lets you do this - these are parts of the system outside the program.\n\nInstead of definitions, what I'm trying to identify are the typical connotations associated with 'a program' - e.g. the fact that it has two 'views': the static structural internal view in the programming language and the dynamic interactive run time view (in the UI language?). Another one is that whenever you run it, it starts afresh and the internal state is reset. Identifying these might indicate room to explore for whatever other abstractions we design."
