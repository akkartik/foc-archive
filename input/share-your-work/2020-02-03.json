Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.Ruby on Rails' emergence in the 2000s greatly influenced web app development, through innovative features such as seamless database table creations, migrations, and scaffolding of views to enable rapid application development. Ruby on Rails' influence on other web frameworks remains apparent today, with many frameworks in other languages borrowing its ideas, including Django in Python, Catalyst in Perl, Laravel and CakePHP in PHP, Phoenix in Elixir, Play in Scala, and Sails.js in Node.js.",

For explaining the reactive nature of notebooks, I find the DAG visualizations in @observablehq\/how-observable-runs to be really helpful.  More broadly, It'd be great to see some visualization in this introduction to a visualization platform.\n1. I trust a product more when it's up front about what it can't do well.  Other than the challenge of learning the new model, I'd be interested to hear what a Jupyter user might actually miss, or work for which Observable might be a worse option.\n1. On the flip side of that, if you believe have good answers, it might be useful to reference the paper from this thread "
