For instance, the layer compositing in all modern browsers happens on the GPU. If you stick to using CSS Transforms instead of flow-based positioning, your positioning happens entirely in the compositing step, GPU-accelerated, and you get a huge perf boost. You can make some highly complex HTML-based scenes that are animated at a buttery 60fps, even on mobile.\n\nThe thing is, there are very few kinds of jobs that you need to do on the web that benefit from GPU acceleration, the way it's currently implemented. And that's where you feel the perf hit.\n\nBut that's also where you feel the hit in games, too! I think a good way to appreciate this is to come at it from the other side â what are the things that happen in games that show just how weak these engines are when you look at things _other_ than the graphics pipeline? There's.. a lot. In fact, most of the things that game engines do.. aren't great, especially when compared to graphics.\n\nI think the state of animation and physics in modern games is particularly appalling. Havok is awfulÂ â it's unnatural, ugly, slow, and often sucks the fun out of gameplay. The graphics pipeline has improved many orders of magnitude over the past 30 years.

However, if we had a serious conversation, Iâd be missing the notion of waste.\n\nThere are developers who care about coding in a way that âminimizes wasteâ, in the sense that they try to use system resources sparingly and effectively. And there are those that donât. That is partly based on the developerâs mindset. And it is partly based on what the tools and environments offer to make you aware of wasteful behavior and how they incentivize you to minimize it.\n\nSome environments encourage you to minimize waste, for instance by showing you a frame rate and making you want to hit 60fps or by limiting you to a tiny amount of memory. Other environments do the opposite, hide metrics like this, and support you in not caring. That is often beneficial when you want to avoid the additional complexity, for instance when learning.\n\nThere are both kinds in both games and web development (and pretty much anywhere). And note that I havenât defined waste â itâs easiest to understand as manifested in performance, but it goes beyond that.",
