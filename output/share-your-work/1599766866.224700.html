Hey all,<br/><br/>I want to present you my new project, <a href="https://adacraft.org/">adacraft</a>! Which is a slightly modified Scratch with new extensions.<br/><br/>This project can be seen as a first step for me to gather user feedback and experiment things on "easier programming".<br/><br/>Using Scratch gives a ready to use programming environment for "non-experts" and adding new extensions and modifying Scratch a bit allows to quickly experiment new use cases, new tools, new way to program. Of course at some point Scratch will be limiting, but I am sure there is enough room for fun experiments!<br/><br/>So far, I have added some AI extensions and a <a href="https://www.croquet.io/">Croquet</a> extension. An AI extension that uses <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/">Teachable Machine</a> models for image classification and an other for face recognition (based on ml5.js, more to come from this library). The Croquet one is very experimental but it is usable for very basic inter-project communication, and the main contribution (nearly all) comes from Yoshiki Ohshima, of the Croquet team.<br/><br/>I have some ideas for new extensions (like, why not, generating HTML/DOM, and, why not, Ã  la Vue.js) and would love to hear from you if you think of something to experiments with some Scratch "constraints".<br/><br/>And of course any feedback and thoughts are very welcome! :pray: :relaxed:

Cool project! What were your reasons for forking Scratch as opposed to e.g. using ScratchX or Blockly?

I have created ScratchX extensions in the past, and in fact it is that experience that made me think that writing Scratch extension is an "easy" way to explore new end-user programming use cases. But ScratchX is based on the "old" flash implementation while Scratch 3 is a pure HTML/JavaScript/CSS which I know better.<br/><br/>And why not Blockly? Well I thought of using Blockly, particularly because you can design any block programming system with it, which opens more possible experiments than with Scratch. But for now I wanted to have a complete environment set up quickly, Scratch is usable now for project useful to users. With Blockly, you have to implement lots of things.

This looks interesting from a conceptual point of view, but I can't bring myself to look at any example in detail for the same reason that I have never seriously played with Scratch: visual clutter and bad contrast makes the code very hard to read. White text in a small font on a yellow background in fancy shapes is not my idea of an ergonomic interface.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on that, Konrad. I totally agree!<br/><br/>I think one of the UX "regressions" from Scratch 2 with the new Scratch 3 design, is less readable block texts. And I find that the new shapes, even if more eye candy, add too much visual clutter. The same with the colors.<br/><br/>I am very tempted to try to change all this with adacraft. I.e dark text on light block background, remove unnecessary part of shapes (like the small "slots") or make them less present. Though I don't know how difficult it will be to change all that...

In fact, ML is a a black box for most people, even for those AI experts! :sweat_smile:<br/><br/>And, on the contrary, I find that bringing people to create their own image classification models with Teachable Machine and making them use it from adacraft (or any Scratch with AI extension, there are others) helps them figure out what ML means, and particularly in terms of bias. I have done it several times since one year during workshops and it is very demonstrative.

&gt; I meant the juxtaposition of what I think of as 'advanced' ML software in pretty much the most beginner-friendly language.<br/>I agree this is really an exciting feature.<br/><br/>And I can't wait to create blocks for all the <a href="https://ml5js.org/">ml5.js</a> library. With this, there will be really interesting new creative possibilities. Adding blocks based the PoseNet, FaceAPI and other interactive stuff will open to new tangible experiments.

Is this open source? I didn't see anything on the site, but I'm on my phone and it's a little awkward.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about a Scratch extension to make use of speech transcription, and maybe this would be an easier place to land that code than Scratch...?

It is not open source yet, but it will at some time. Can't tell exactly when, but I will work on it in the near future (it needs some clean up + some update of the Scratch code to a more recent version).<br/><br/>Your extension sounds really great! I guess it is easier to make your extension part of adacraft than Scratch. I would be happy to help you on it!

You might want to disable it for <tt>.blocklyDropdownText</tt> , too, but you'll get gray instead of black because the dropdown seems to be covered by a dim transparent overlay. Still, making the text black is a big improvement already.

Thanks a lot <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Sietse Brouwer</span> to point this out!<br/><br/>Since Konrad started to talk about it, it sticks in my mind and I can't wait to experiment different layouts...<br/><br/>Maybe, I will play with it on my local env. But before pushing it online, I guess I will try using it for some time. I have to be sure it looks OK.<br/><br/>I guess I also will make the blocks background lighters, if not completely white.<br/><br/>And, maybe, if I can, I will keep the two themes, for those that feel more comfortable with the original one.
