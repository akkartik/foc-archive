It's called \"Grenades\", because the piano part involves taking your right hand and lifting it off the high keys on the far right, lifting it way up high in the air and then forcefully PLONKing a really low note at the far left end of the keyboard — your hand makes this big ark motion through the air, like a grenade. You _have_ to do that. It's against the rules to play the song without doing that.",

        "text": "For the curious, a good entry point into the \"what is computer animation missing?\" question is this short video from Polygon about smear frames — <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vIdeGmN__Pw>. Historically, smear frames in 3d animation haven't been practical because of the limitations of 3d character tools: bones, skinning, IK, vertex weighting, etc., don't allow you to \"bend\" the character between bones, or duplicate a limb for a single frame, or wildly change the structure of a character. The geometry is _too_ reified. The idea of \"make a relatively static thing and then move it around, unchanging\" is too deeply rooted.\n\nThere was a great article (can't find it right now) about the difference between animation in Crash Bandicoot (which was vertex-based) and in Super Mario 64 (which was object-based), and how the former allowed for all sorts of wild expressivity that let them achieve a classic WB cartoon feel, while the latter (a much better game, notwithstanding) looks really stiff, like a puppet. Same era, same(ish) hardware constraints, different implementation, wildly different results.\n\nThere are examples like this going all the way back to the origins of computer animation. Tradeoffs were made, and those early tradeoffs became institutionalized, and the culture of computer animation is narrower as a result. You don't see a lot of folks using 3d animation tools to make stuff <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TuJqUvBj4rE&amp;t=0s|like this>. No technical reason you couldn't make a polygon-based modelling, animation, and rendering tool that could excel at that.\n\nYou do see this sort of wild expressivity using computer-based tools to produce traditional, frame-by-frame 2d animation. That's great. The computer is helping. But this is an example of the computer just being a better version of a light table and onion paper, as opposed to unlocking entirely new approaches (a la 3d animation).",

The idea of \"make a relatively static thing and then move it around, unchanging\" is too deeply rooted.\n\nThere was a great article (can't find it right now) about the difference between animation in Crash Bandicoot (which was vertex-based) and in Super Mario 64 (which was object-based), and how the former allowed for all sorts of wild expressivity that let them achieve a classic WB cartoon feel, while the latter (a much better game, notwithstanding) looks really stiff, like a puppet. Same era, same(ish) hardware constraints, different implementation, wildly different results.\n\nThere are examples like this going all the way back to the origins of computer animation. Tradeoffs were made, and those early tradeoffs became institutionalized, and the culture of computer animation is narrower as a result. You don't see a lot of folks using 3d animation tools to make stuff "

But this is an example of the computer just being a better version of a light table and onion paper, as opposed to unlocking entirely new approaches (a la 3d animation)."
