Lisperanto - in browser structured editor and version control (in a future) <a href="https://uprun.github.io/lisperanto/">https://uprun.github.io/lisperanto/</a><br/>hi, this project is still under development, currently it have basic algebraic primitives and possibility to create own functions, it is local-first and statically-hosted,<br/>in a future all operations on AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) will be stored in order to have proper version control and to allow cooperation on a code.<br/>Though I have selected Lisp idea about code as a data, this does not mean it should be always Lisp syntax, I will try to borrow nice features from other languages as well hence the name.
