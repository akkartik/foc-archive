Anyone reading this post probably used at least two of these technologies today, MacOS\/iOS users have likely benefitted from all four.\n\nThere's definitely a cultural problem around how modern OSS work is funded.  The idea that individuals should fund the projects they use out of after tax salary while companies carry on building empire on the backs of OSS contributors is grotesque, and I'm still fairly bitter that I wasn't able to get Google to put any money (beyond Summer of Code projects) into improving _emacs_ even though half their engineers were using it daily.\n\n&gt; it also killed the market for development of better software tools.

The world is a multidimensional space and there is definitely a lot of \"movement\" even in the last 20-40 years. However it doesn't mean there has been movement along any axis that _you care about_. The note about 50 year old OSes and 30 year old text editors definitely resonates with me. \"Scaling\" is a word that gets mentioned a lot re the last 20 years. But our main ideas on scaling haven't fundamentally changed and I'd say the effort has been along \"brute force\" wrt software creation. What, 10 hand written lines of code don't do the trick? Lets like 10 billion by hand!! Moar libraries on top of moar libraries! Too hard to manage the stack of dependencies? No worries - moar package managers!! Etc.\n\nSide note: I am amazed that at the fundamental hardware capability level there have been mind boggling advances. 4K displays, 5G, terabytes of affordable SSDs, etc. A lot of hard work has gone in to make that stuff happen.",

The note about 50 year old OSes and 30 year old text editors definitely resonates with me. \"Scaling\" is a word that gets mentioned a lot re the last 20 years. But our main ideas on scaling haven't fundamentally changed and I'd say the effort has been along \"brute force\" wrt software creation. What, 10 hand written lines of code don't do the trick? Lets like 10 billion by hand!! Moar libraries on top of moar libraries! Too hard to manage the stack of dependencies? No worries - moar package managers!! Etc.\n\nSide note: I am amazed that at the fundamental hardware capability level there have been mind boggling advances. 4K displays, 5G, terabytes of affordable SSDs, etc. A lot of hard work has gone in to make that stuff happen."
