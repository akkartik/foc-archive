Why don't we "put our code where our mouths are"?<br/><br/>I've used really alpha projects in many areas but I almost never consider using "future of code" projects other than a short evaluation<br/><br/>My main "excuses":<br/><br/>• the result must be available as a web page/app<br/>• if it involves writing it must have vim keybindings (that's why I never stick to "tools for thought" note taking apps)<br/>Which are yours?

• Not having enough domain knowledge to do the setup for a project to test it<br/>• (a big one) if the above the fold presentation of the project doesn’t have an immediate feel of Utility or connection to my work, I will rarely explore it for its sake alone<br/>Second one stinks as a mindset because there's a lot to learn in experimentation with the unfamiliar.<br/><br/>• one more: not being able to build a project or understand it's usage because of a readme or wiki that assumes wwwaaayyy too much of the reader. “This project creates free energy. Simply unpack with widget.exe and unload into the multi daemon headless container (don't clink the gringle) and flap the narple. This works on all operating systems.”  Me: “… what the flip is a gringle?? How does one flap anything??”

Libraries. I'm sufficiently proficient with popular technologies that it is less work for me to tolerate a less dynamic environment in exchange for access to libraries that do the heavy lifting for me.<br/><br/>Extension languages (closely related to the above). If a scriptable application can already do what I need, it is often easier to script it in whatever crappy extension language it supports than it is to figure out how to do what I need in a general purpose programming environment, no matter how dynamic or flexible it is.

Most projects here are something to program. I get a list of ingredients that I can put together however I like. Since I already have ways to program I don't feel like I'm in the target audience. Now if they were something I started to <em>use</em>, I'd probably end up programming them over time.<br/><br/>I tend not to worry about this question, because of how I think about this community. It's to bat around raw ideas, prototypes and experiments, but hallway usability studies here are not a replacement for getting out of the building and engaging with your target audience, whoever that is.<br/><br/>(Unless you consider the people here to be your target audience. In which case lack of uptake means some assumption is getting falsified.)
