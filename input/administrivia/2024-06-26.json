This was important to me, but was able to sidestep this because they provided free hosting for my community.\n• They have two Android apps. One is old and a new one is being built in Flutter. Screenshot for the new one is attached.\n• A small annoyance I felt (I was comparing it with Discord which has both threads and forums) was that <https:\/\/chat.zulip.org\/#narrow\/stream\/101-design\/topic\/Automatic.20Topics|every thread needs a manually entered Topic>. Discord generates thread topics automatically. This might not be a problem for us.\n• They are responsive to feature requests and bug reports. <https:\/\/chat.zulip.org|Their own Zulip> is public and things are discussed openly. I asked for some improvements in custom profile fields and a reasonably solution was implemented.\nOverall, I felt that Zulip can work for technical users where density of content is important.
