Pivoting your company is a time-honored strategy. I was working on a PC game inspired by the movie "Fantastic Voyage" which miniaturized a ship to fix a blood clot, and was building a painting tool to help make this huge body map that animated the blood flow. I couldn't get the artist Mark Ferrari (famous pixel artist who did LucasArts games Maniac Mansion, Loom, Monkey Island, etc) to switch out of his EA Deluxe Paint II paint program so i cloned it, and then after a while developing the body game, it turned out that no retailer would accept a body game as medical software was retail poison (yeah, because medicine is so unimportant! yikes!), so I repurposed the paint program for teenagers as a sequel to KidPix, and sold a zillion copies on Floppy Disk and later on CDROM as Flying Colors. Still the best kids painting program, now freeware at <a href="http://magicmouse.com">magicmouse.com</a>, and miraculously still runs in 256 color mode even on Windows 10 due to MS incredible commitment to compatibility.  It is smart when your original mission is untenable, to take what you do have and sell it.
