I've been posting a few things, so I feel like its time for me to drop an introduction in here. My name is Aleks. I'm a software engineer living and working in Massachusetts. I went to school for game development, but fell in love with programming languages and web development along the way. I'm interested in building tools that make computers easier to use without paving over the underlying complexity of computing. I believe when there's a dissonance between what a program appears to be doing and what a computer is actually doing, it causes pain all up and down the stack - from end users to the folks designing the silicon.<br/><br/>I have a terrible track record of leaving projects unfinished, but I will include a link here to one of my more finished projects - a command line tool for working with tags the same way you would work with files. <a href="https://github.com/alekslitynski/tagsystem">https://github.com/alekslitynski/tagsystem</a>. Like everyone else here, I'm currently hacking on a visual programming system. I'm hoping to get it to a point in the next few months where other people could jump on board and participate in its development, if they want to.<br/><br/>This community seems wonderful, and I'm excited to dive into it.
