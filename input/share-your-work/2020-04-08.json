If you are going to only comment a little bit, spend it on the parameters.\n\nSome of your comments about performance are no longer true. For example, `JS` is now nearly as fast as `C` due to the incredible V8 engine. In many cases today the programs we run are dominated by time spent in the OS or underlying platform. In a web browser for example there is a huge overhead for each tab, often tens of megabytes, far more than our own programs.

Nested for-loops are superior to `Map\/filter` because they can  be interrupted while Map cannot. `Map` is merely an encapsulation of a `for-loop` and thus is merely syntactic sugar as they call it, that also happens to remove the ability to stop precisely. You may be traversing a 2D array and want to stop on a match. How does one do that with Map? You can't. So `for-loops` are not an endangered species. In fact all of the primitive instructions as envisioned by the earliest pioneers such as arithmetic, 2-way and N-way branching, call\/return, looping, will never go away; nothing wrong with learning them",
