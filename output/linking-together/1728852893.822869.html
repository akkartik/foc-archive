<a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/architeuthis-flux/jumperless-v5#products">Jumperless v5</a> - future of electronics programming?<br/><br/>&gt; It’s an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for hardware, with an analog-by-nature RP2350B-based dev board, a drawer full of wires, and a workbench full of test equipment (including a power supply, a multimeter, an oscilloscope, a function generator, and a logic analyzer) all crammed inside a breadboard.<br/>Also, speaking of “open”, this is impressive:<br/><br/>&gt; If you don’t love your Jumperless V5, we will always accept returns, for a full refund, and repairs will always be free, regardless of the cause.<br/>&gt; And if you want to make your own, that’s cool too. Jumperless V5 is designed to be infinitely open source and hackable. And that goes beyond the documentation and design files linked above. It also includes my support, advice, and assistance. Want to manufacture a dozen DIY Jumperless V5s for you and eleven of your friends? Want to improve my design by <em>upgrading</em> that USB Type-C connector to Mini USB? I’m all about it. In fact, feel free to run your design by me so I can double-check everything before you send it off to your CM! I’ll even mail you the custom spring clips.<br/>
