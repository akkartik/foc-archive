Hi everyone! I just joined the community, so it's nice to meet you all. My name is Isaac Carrasco-Ortiz (he/him), and I am the Digital Equity Fellow for the Executive Office of Aging &amp; Independence based in Boston, Massachusetts in the United States. I have been here as an AmeriCorps member, where my role is to help the state agency address digital inequities that exist for older adults throughout the state (poor access to broadband services, poor digital skills, access to respectful technological devices and services that best fit their needs). We've mainly been fighting for this through federal funds that were made available to address the digital divide (funds were given to senior centers and their partners to start or expand digital literacy programming for older adults). However, now that the funds are set to run out, we've been sketching out what role the state agency can play in making technology more respectful and socially conscious of the needs and thoughts of older adults in Massachusetts moving forward. I've been increasingly exploring this relationship between humanity and technology, and it's through some more reading of that that I learned of Douglas Engelbart's Augmenting Human Intellect essay. I thought I'd look more into if other organizations were speaking about this essay, and it's through that search that learned of the Future of Coding, namely the podcast episode that spoke about him and his work (I haven't listened to it yet!).<br/><br/>I hope to become active in this community. If you're in the Boston area and are interested in learning more about what we're up to, just shoot me a message! I should note that my background is not in tech, but rather sociology and systems of oppression. Looking forward to learning more about your work and insights! Thanks y'all :blush:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-carrasco-ortiz-42639b1aa/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-carrasco-ortiz-42639b1aa/</a>
