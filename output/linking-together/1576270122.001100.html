Anybody here have experience with Wardley maps? I've been vaguely aware of them, but this series has been a clear introduction: <a href="https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec">https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec</a>

Wouldn’t say that I have experience, but I read the whole series/book, and think it’s a very good framework for strategy, and there’s a lot in there that I think can also be adapted to software development.<br/><br/>Just the pioneers/settlers/town planner distinction plus letting them use different development methodologies (agile/lean/six sigma) would solve so many problems in big corporations that still try the one size fits all approach.

"In my business plan, navigation was storytelling, learning was from copying others, strategy was based on magic frameworks." Sounds like a metaphor for a lot of text based programming practice. Imperative programming is a kind of storytelling, according to his metaphor.<br/><br/>"In a high situational awareness environment, such as using a chessboard, navigation is visual, learning is from context specific play, strategy is based on position and movement." Are there lessons here for the design of visual programming environments? New kinds of visual maps that would enhance programming?

The first few chapters where he describes what makes a proper map should be very interesting for everyone designing visual programming environments.<br/><br/>Most visual tools allow you to place boxes and nodes arbitrarily — the position has no meaning. In a map, position means everything. He has a good example with an architecture diagram in “Elvish” to illustrate that.<br/><br/>I think spatial positioning charged with meaning is something that hasn’t been explored enough for visual interfaces.
