&gt; <em>text is the most powerful, useful, effective communication technology ever</em>, period.<br/>I feel this disregards all of our data visualization efforts. I don't think we have a saying "A picture speaks a thousand words" for nothing.<br/><br/>&gt; This blog post is likely to take perhaps 5000 bytes of storage, and could compress down to maybe 2000; by comparison the following 20-pixel-square image of the silhouette of a tweeting bird takes 4000 bytes<br/>This comparison is so hard to make. Do we need to add the bytes fetched for all glyphs? Doesn't that bird take just a couple hundred bytes when encoded as svg? Comparing information like this seems weird to me. Also: It's not even the same information he is comparing! He compares his blog post with an image of a bird. It is now up to the reader to gauge the amount of information in both. I feel like that one is just a hard argument to follow.<br/><br/>More abstractly, I don't buy the argument in the context of about node-based graphical interfaces: The article argues not <em>replacing</em> text with something graphical, but I almost every visual interface includes text. Few people try to <em>replace</em> text. Most people try to <em>augment</em> it. Whether that augmentation adds something or not is an entirely different argument, that I don't feel is talked about in the article.

For reference, here's an svg file of a twitter bird. It's 877 bytes uncompressed. (But again, I feel the comparison still lacks completely. Just wanted to spread the word about 'use svg, not png!' :slightly_smiling_face: )

Anyone planning to reply here, please note that <a href="../linking-together/1592430013.363800.html">the link</a> Duncan shared is to a thread in #linking-together that already has a lot of replies. While it might be time consuming, you'd do us all a favour by reviewing the replies there and adding any new thoughts at the end. Thanks :)

Whoops! There's me thinking that was a twitter reference for some reason. My bad :v:
