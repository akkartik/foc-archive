Out of sheer frustration, I copied the snippet (~100 loc) into a blank text document, replaced all the variable names with sentences describing what they contain, replaced all function calls with a description of what the function does and the data it operates on, and then sent it back. I left in syntax like variable declarations, return statements, array destructuring operations and array methods (map, filter, etc). Within 5 minutes we were able to have a reasonably productive conversation about the process and how we could refactor it, and it just seemed like it really “clicked” for both of us. It was the closest experience I’ve come to in terms of having a “shared mental model”. So I’m curious: is there anyone in this group working on tools for writing and reasoning about pseudocode?",

Out of sheer frustration, I copied the snippet (~100 loc) into a blank text document, replaced all the variable names with sentences describing what they contain, replaced all function calls with a description of what the function does and the data it operates on, and then sent it back. I left in syntax like variable declarations, return statements, array destructuring operations and array methods (map, filter, etc). Within 5 minutes we were able to have a reasonably productive conversation about the process and how we could refactor it, and it just seemed like it really “clicked” for both of us. It was the closest experience I’ve come to in terms of having a “shared mental model”. So I’m curious: is there anyone in this group working on tools for writing and reasoning about pseudocode?"
