<a href="https://damaged.bleu255.com/">Damaged Earth Catalog</a><br/>&gt; We are humans and might as well get used to it. So far, remotely done power and glory—as via government, big business, formal education, church—has succeeded to the point where gross profits obscure actual loss. In response to this dilemma and to these losses a realm of intimate, community power is developing—power of communities to conduct their own education, find their own inspiration, shape their own environment, and share their knowledge with others. Practices that aid this process are sought and promoted by the DAMAGED EARTH CATALOG.

This catalog is about the future of technology, with many entries explicitly about computing. There is some overlap with topics we have been discussing here, but not that much.<br/><br/>This raises the question of how the "future of coding" is related to wider visions of the future of technology, and to expectations about the future of humanity.

I have also pondering on this. The question of values and how we represent and communicate them came up: <a href="https://meaningalignment.substack.com/p/new-paper-what-are-human-values-and">https://meaningalignment.substack.com/p/new-paper-what-are-human-values-and</a>
