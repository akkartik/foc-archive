Hello all, I'm Chadwick. I'm an independent software developer, with most of my time devoted to the design and development of an app for the creation and management of patches/sounds for hardware synthesizers.<br/><br/>My work is essentially the creation of a unified platform for synth patch editors, as well as the implementation of dozens of editors on that platform. So over the years I've continually refined and refactored this codebase to make the experience of implementing new editors more elegant and simple. It's involved learning a lot about how to architect the system for flexibility to accommodate the different structures and needs of different synthesizers. And this sort of system is a fun programming context in which there is a central data model (the sound patch) but the user might want lots of different views and ways to operate on that data (e.g. views that give you access to every parameter, or views that give simplified/opinionated controls that affect multiple parameters, etc). The sound designer themselves is a kind of programmer, and I'd like to keep pushing my platform to new areas of tooling for these users.<br/><br/>The next frontier for me is the implementation of some sort of scripting language for the creation of new editors on my platform, to open that programming experience up to a larger audience, so I'm (just) starting to think more about programming language design and experience, and these future of coding discussions are really inspirational to me within that context.<br/><br/>I don't have my own future of coding project per se, but the topic is of great interest to me. I started listening to the podcast a long time ago, and only recently realized that there's a Slack, and I joined immediately. :slightly_smiling_face:
