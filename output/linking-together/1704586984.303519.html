Nice. I've been watching sploot, and it seems like she has made a lot of progress. I'm a little confused why she went with "wrap" instead of changing the order of nodes as a primary action. I also think deciding from the beginning that you don't want drag and drop for anything misses out on a lot of cool stuff that is easier to do in a structure-aware tool like TYLR than in any text editor. I also think there's difference between being able to drag and drop, and being required to. A block editor with keyboard editing and a touch screen is sort of where I think the sweet spot might be.
