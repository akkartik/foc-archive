Following up on <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span>'s follow-up: please feel free to post problem statements and react to other people's problem statements ^^ above ^^. Also feel free to use this thread as a retrospective. We've had a few threads now where the format of comments was tightly circumscribed, and it's high time you had a place to comment on specific statements, ask for clarification, post clarification.<br/><br/>I'm going to be offline for the next week. But I'll read everything after I get back, post my own comments and questions (I have a few but won't lead off with my own) and then create some sort of digestible summary.
