<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Pezo - Zoltan Peto</span> I’ve actually been pretty fortunate to land a job working on implementing a dependently typed DSL at my job (because my boss is excited about them). But yeah, the more you dig into trying to implement them, the more you realise how much we still need to figure out in order to make them viable. I’m still pretty hopeful though. There’s lots of cool work going on at the moment, especially in the realm of modal type theory, and I’m hoping some of it starts coming together in cool, practical ways!<br/><br/>My advice is to keep plugging away learning, and talk about it online like you’re doing. You might be surprised who you bump into! But it will probably be more of a case of ‘putting yourself in a position to be lucky’, and networking, than finding a job advertised explicitly.
