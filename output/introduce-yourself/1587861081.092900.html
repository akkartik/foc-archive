Hi all, I am an ex-mathematician turned programmer interested in stuff like type theory functional programming etc. Professionally I work on a bioinformatics platform written in haskell. I am also interested (but much less knowledgeable) about creative programming and ways to make programming accessible. I was inspired to join the slack after the excellent recent episode on the survey of the community. Previously I only listened to the podcast (which <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> has so far been killing it on) but am inspired to see what the wider community is like.

What made you make the switch from math to programming?<br/><br/>Here you ever watched standupmaths or 3blue1brown on YouTube?

Overall I didn't like the feedback cycle I had with research mathematics which was a lot of feeling very confused and like I was not making much tangilbe progress. Programming in many ways feels just the opposite to me - you get quite immediate feedback all the time. I was also not very good at the kind of research I was trying to do which was rather technical. On top of that I simply got the haskell bug, I didn't know about functional programming (my programming experience consisted to that point of a Java course from university) and I found it to fit how I think really well.<br/><br/>I have watched both of those Youtube channels, they are quite delightful.
