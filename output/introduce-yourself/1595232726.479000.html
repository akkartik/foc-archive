As I'm participating more I should probably do this...<br/><br/>I've been programming since the 1970s. Originally focused on physics and mathematics, I was lured astray by certain findings in theoretical computer science. This is my 35th year as a Lisper and Emacs user. My first purely functional programming language was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_(programming_language)">Miranda</a>, c. 1987.<br/><br/>My desert island programming languages are Scheme, FORTH, Smalltalk and ML (Prolog's features are better as a library), but my most used language since 2009 is Clojure.<br/><br/>While I <em>prefer</em> to use highly interactive languages, I've also written millions of lines of C code in the course of my career, which has included all sorts of things from building operating systems, clustered filesystems and high-performance language runtimes to creating the first purpose-built <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore">Triplestore</a> for the semantic web to building some of the earliest streaming databases and complex event processing systems to building a big document understanding system using a mix of modern statistical and classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence">GOFAI</a> techniques (most recent startup exit).<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> interviewed me for the podcast last summer:<br/><br/><a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/041.html">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/041.html</a><br/><br/>At university I also studied classical music composition and played guitar in the jazz orchestra. Some years later, while doing a startup in the Valley, I attended art school at night. If you're interested in some recent work at the intersection of art + tech, here's a talk I gave last autumn in Helsinki:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeXCvh5X5w0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeXCvh5X5w0</a><br/><br/>Looking forward to getting to know everyone. :slightly_smiling_face:

Sitting in my basement I clapped for <em>Golden Beads</em> like a dumbass.
