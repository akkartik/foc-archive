It was built from scratch and adapted over many years to suit the wide variety of use cases needed. It was still a reasonably generic workflow system, but by being something in house we were able to make it have the actual features that would get the job done, as opposed to grabbing something off the shelf and praying.\n\nMy core criticism of BPMN and most workflow systems - like say Camunda - is that they are simply a kind of glorified chart execution system. In general, they are completely disconnected from the actual system they are meant to control. They started from the same kind of modeling background as UML, and have historically had trouble IMO by effectively standardizing first. There was a lot of speculation about the value it could bring. On paper it might seem like the right path: create a visually oriented tool for describing business processes. Focus on the visual language that subject matter experts might be able to understand. Then create a standard for it so that a variety of tools can consume it. One of the problems you see is that the early versions of UML\/BPMN were really about a shared visual language for communication purposes. Then as the hope of making it work through automation came into play and a variety of enterprise vendors got involved. Both UML and BPMN went through revisions into order to give them execution semantics to actually run. It was also happening during peak XML\/WebServices complexity explosion was happening. This also dramatically increased the complexity, in many ways making a kind of worst of both worlds. Its no surprise to me that the AWS step function system is not based on BPMN, but is quite simple in comparison.\n\nIf you want a gruesome inside look of what creating a standard through OMG is like, I find this tale about CORBA to be a good example of the kind of insanity that happens when you make a standard from vendor soup: "
