Hi folks! :wave: I'm delighted that a long chain of links from papers on visualisation and visual programming languages finally led me to discover this community.<br/><br/>I'm enthusiastic about making systems programming more accessible and explorable. In particular, my goal is to bring more people into the Rust community and I'm working on applying some of the Bret Victor's and Papert's ideas in <a href="https://lowlvl.org">Low-Level Academy</a>, which is intended to be a free &amp; open resource to learn about things like networking, operating systems, or virtual memory in an interactive and project-based fashion.<br/><br/>I'm also exploring ideas about making <a href="https://docs.rs/std">Rust documentation</a> easier to understand, thinking about how to bring collaboration &amp; sharing into the interactive playgrounds, how to make them a11y-friendly, and about how to find time to work on all this stuff. :smile:
