Also, realized I'm not sure if I introduced myself to the much smaller Boston chat... awkward, haha.<br/><br/>So Hi, I'm Tony. As it says above, I work a Ginkgo Bioworks. Prior to coming here I worked on robotics at a number of local companies including Amazon Robotics, Rethink Robotics and iRobot. At my previous job I focused mainly on coming up with tools and architectures for rapid programming of large-scale robotic workcells. Definitely interested to chat with folks on any interesting coding nerdery they are doing, especially folks in the area!
