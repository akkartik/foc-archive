Looking forward to taking a bit more of an active part.\n\nI’ve been working with Clojure, and especially Datomic where I can, for the last few years, with small forays into iOS and (slightly larger excursions) web applications. FP, structural editing and s-expressions are my happy place, mashed up with abusing browsers and CSS to do occasionally surprising things. I amuse myself with generative art pieces when I have time, using quil and trying to keep up with some of <https:\/\/www.tylerxhobbs.com\/|Tyler Hobbs>’ excellent examples. <https:\/\/www.owenschuh.com\/|Owen Schuh> is another favourite - really love his work.
