&gt; how to build a webserver<br/>I see your point. The thing we wanted to do is get your something <b>real</b> immediately. So a hello-world is kinda the first thing dev’s do when trying a language (generally speaking). Do you feel there is a more valuable example? One issue we have seen is that when we use “slack bots” or “twitter streamers” the reaction from most is thinking that is all we do :disappointed: which is sad and not representative of what we really can do.<br/><br/>&gt; You need a better example to show off its strengths.<br/>We have examples at <a href="https://github.com/storyscript/examples">https://github.com/storyscript/examples</a> — I agree a better example would be nice.<br/><br/>&gt; Maybe you receive a request and make a request elsewhere?<br/>Like this: <a href="https://storyscript.io/blog/story-telling/">https://storyscript.io/blog/story-telling/</a> (scroll to about mid page)<br/><br/>&gt; Or make a request elsewhere and postprocess its results before sending them back?<br/>That could be cool! I do think something usable and not to abstract is best. Otherwise, IMO the developer could get lost in the “why” rather than experiencing the product’s power.
