I'm self taught and have a deep appreciation for low level and graphics programming and making things from scratch. Joined here as recommended by <@U05EBGZTUBY> because I was theorycrafting a \"reverse game engine\" where the focus would be on textual programming with smaller editors instead of the other way round. Glad to be here!",
