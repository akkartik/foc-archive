The points around complexity are interesting. I do agree many things seem more complex than they need to be. OTOH, we are also capable of aggregating many simple things together until the whole becomes more complex. So we're always pushing against a boundary where things get too complex and start to get mind boggling. The question then is how do we do more before we hit this boundary? And how do we make survive complexity rather than avoiding it?
