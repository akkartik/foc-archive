I've been rereading <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code">https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code</a> during my latest bout of introspection. It annoyed me out of all proportion when I first read it (even though I could and still can appreciate the craft that went into it), and with the benefit of hindsight (and having joined this forum 3 years later) I think I understand why: it's unabashedly about the <em>present</em> of software, and by nature that endeavor makes a virtue to newcomers out of how things work today.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I argued the opposite direction over at <a href="1645811249.437739.html#1645838782.428059">1.645838.html&hellip;</a>. So it seems to matter how vehemently I feel about the thing being taught to newcomers, whether I consider it important or irrelevant frippery.
