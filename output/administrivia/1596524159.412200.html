<em>Starting a new thread, since the <a href="1595571837.137000.html">previous</a> was one of the biggest ever, and long since became unwieldy (thanks Slack, you're the best).</em><br/><br/>Here's my revised and hopefully final plan for renaming channels, based on weighing all the feedback so far.<br/><br/>Design goals! The channels should balance a lot of competing forces, so that, as much as possible, they...<br/>• are easy to communicate, comprehend, and remember the purpose of each.<br/>• are distinctly named, so each channel has an identity.<br/>• are part of a scheme that can adapt and scale.<br/>• form meaningful groupings under alphanumeric sort
