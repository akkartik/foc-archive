Hello Future of Coding folks!<br/><br/>It's been a while since I've crawled out from my cave, but I've come to share something fun, at least I think so. I've finally managed to get the downloadable TestFlight betas up for free for my visualizer tool for macOS and iOS, and you can get the links here on the main GitHub page:<br/><br/><a href="https://github.com/tikimcfee/LookAtThat/">https://github.com/tikimcfee/LookAtThat/</a><br/><br/>Many thanks go out to everyone here that helped answer odd questions at odd hours to help me build this first releasable beta. Cheers, and let me know what breaks!
