But that doesn't necessarily compare with efficiencies from an existential war 80 years ago (did the calculation account for inflation?!). In my experience revenues are justification for _reduced_ efficiency. And none of this accounts for the value to society, which is a fraction of the cost if you could somehow (naive, I know) stop trying to think up new ways to juice revenues in user hostile ways.\n\nOf course, how do you build just the valuable parts without the hostile parts? You got me..\n\n(This comment partly inspired by the sprawling thread spawned by <https:\/\/wandering.shop\/@cstross\/110989030686287315|https:\/\/wandering.shop\/@cstross\/110989030686287315>)",
