Ah, what the heck, let's just try this: <a href="!channel">!channel</a>, I know this is ultra-short notice and some of you will likely read this after it happened (if it does at all), but who here is spontaneous and interested in meeting up <b>tomorrow night, Thursday Dec 5th, 18:00</b> in London at <b>Brewdog Shoreditch</b>? (<a href="https://www.brewdog.com/bars/uk/brewdog-shoreditch#bar-info-map">https://www.brewdog.com/bars/uk/brewdog-shoreditch#bar-info-map</a>)<br/><br/>Unofficial, no presentations, no speaker slots, just some drinks, maybe some food if you like, and conversations about whatever you'd like to talk about. Who's in?
