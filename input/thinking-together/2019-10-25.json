Then conventional run time. Most Curv programs evaluate to produce a shape value. A shape contains a signed distance function and a colour function. In the third phase, these functions are compiled into GLSL shader code, which is run on the GPU in the fourth phase. During 3rd phase compilation, many compile time constants were actually computed during 2nd phase evaluation. So 2nd phase evaluation could be viewed as a kind of partial evaluation.",

There is the conventional compile phase (macro expansion happens at this time, but macros are only used internally, they aren't user defined). Then conventional run time. Most Curv programs evaluate to produce a shape value. A shape contains a signed distance function and a colour function. In the third phase, these functions are compiled into GLSL shader code, which is run on the GPU in the fourth phase. During 3rd phase compilation, many compile time constants were actually computed during 2nd phase evaluation. So 2nd phase evaluation could be viewed as a kind of partial evaluation."
