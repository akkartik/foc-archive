hi team!<br/>I've been following <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> for a while.. and now is the time to join.<br/><br/>My thesis and my team's is that everyone should have access to general purpose computation, so that they can unlock data and processes that only they can customize. Our approach is to package the basic ingredients (logic, I/O, clocks, persistence and "databases") into the functions of the cells of a spreadsheet. Like lego.<br/><br/>My initial thinking on the matter started a few years back (<a href="https://www.patife.com/entries/9/">https://www.patife.com/entries/9/</a>).<br/>We're launching in a couple of weeks at <a href="http://dashdash.com">dashdash.com</a>. we're a 2-year old startup where i'm a product owner and CEO in a great team of 24.<br/><br/>so far we have built<br/>- the regular excel functions like vlookup(), min(), max(), etc (same names, syntax, types and coercion)<br/>- new: web functions like get(), post(), and integrations that give you send_sms() and more<br/>- new: automation with repeat(  , period)<br/>- new: side effects with insert() and update() for table-to-table operations.<br/>You can find a video of an example of what we do here <a href="https://twitter.com/patife/status/1086345026643394560">https://twitter.com/patife/status/1086345026643394560</a><br/><br/>I hope to get feedback on our product and explore how to <em>translate</em> programming for non-techies, which functions to build, and how to avoid people taping into dangerous resources. you can follow me at <a href="https://twitter.com/patife/">https://twitter.com/patife/</a>
