Is there any research about 3d user interface? Right now we use the windows from Xerox popularized by Macbooks. But I am considering to make it as a game scene, where everything is represented as a 3d objects. I couldn't find anything related to this, or attempts before. The only close thing for this is the holograms from the sci-fi.<br/>As a reference, I am making a social network, but I want it to be a 3d. As a reference here is the prototype:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suOaUQmMSGo&amp;t=144s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suOaUQmMSGo&amp;t=144s</a><br/><br/>I also recorded the new form of interface for the crypto wallets. How the transferring tokens from your address to another is done. If there are any systematic explanation of 3d objects, I would appreciate it. :)

There have been a bunch of 3d computing UI experiments. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquet_Project">Croquet</a> is one of the most famous, but Iâ€™m sure others here can point to more.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span> I checked your reality computer. Do you work on the prototype yourself. Is that a startup with the closed source, or you plan to make it open source?<br/><br/>I was thinking how about potential team forming to work together. Maybe I can schedule a call with you if you don't mint?

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Medet Ahmetson</span> I just finished watching your videos - they're very well produced and the ideas are very interesting of course. My "Reality Computer" is fully open, yes, in every way! I don't have the mental wiring to do commercial stuff or marketing and so-on! So it's just me on my own writing C code! :smile: Now, I don't see any strong overlap between my stuff and your ideas of AI- and "<a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Mechanical Turk</a>"-assisted End-User customisation or programming! The 3D stuff is very nice, but it's obviously not really your core offering: you could do the whole thing in 2D I should imagine. There are many folk on FoC here that will be interested in talking to you about your project for sure.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span> You are right. Can you also look at the most recent update?<br/><br/><a href="https://youtu.be/RrE_NkExyiw?si=1RSmSpjh4NWCHRhW">https://youtu.be/RrE_NkExyiw?si=1RSmSpjh4NWCHRhW</a><br/><br/>As for the 3d, I decided to add it slowly. for now prioritizing the core. The thing that overlaps is the augmentation of data. That messages from messaging apps can be moved, linked to let's say to the tasks on project management software.<br/><br/>For the upcoming month I will push the new update. Where instead reinventing all the apps, I decided to make it as the interface for the services. For messaging I will use Telegram. For project management I will use the Trello. Both have the API. And we can build the custom interface for them. As the Ara as the interface, it will allow messages, tasks to be shared across different services. The AI is the cherry on the cake that can automate the stuff. It's in the long run. I want this web operating system to be as <a href="https://rem.ing/">https://rem.ing/</a> and AI learns from the all user's behaviour to find common patterns and help automate the stuff so user will interact with the computer less. Interested now? :slightly_smiling_face:

Ha ! :smile: I was researching "intelligent user interfaces" in 1989 in my first job, so I've got some form, and the idea was that the UI would learn from you and become part of you in some way, thinking ahead to what you may want next. Didn't get very far due to lack of money and time! (We also tried applying neural networks to predicting the stock market, but again didn't get too far due to lack of resources.)

But ... I don't do AI any more and blockchain tech isn't part of my vision in any way, so I don't think there's a match between our work, but I'm sure there are many FoCcers (:upside_down_face:!) who will be more synergistic with all this!
