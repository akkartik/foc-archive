<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nick Smith</span> - Great point about abstraction! Unfortunately, many devs unknowingly confuse "abstraction" with other things. So here's a bit on that to help Nick's point get across more clearly:<br/><br/>Programmers often call it "abstraction" when a placeholder is used to refer to something specified or defined elsewhere. But that's not abstraction, it's indirection. And if the idea is for various different entities (or different implementations) to fill that placeholder, then that's <b>composition</b>.<br/><br/>Abstraction means throwing out unimportant / irrelevant details -- not hiding or separating them, but excluding them altogether.<br/><br/>This is especially confusing in class-based languages wherein classes and methods are labeled "abstract" when they lack a (default) implementation.<br/><br/>For example, consider an "abstract class" C with members X Y Z. What makes it abstract is not that X Y Z are implemented elsewhere, but that sub-class S may <b>also</b> define A B C. So the code can say "give me a C" (something with X Y Z), but you can give it an S (i.e something with A B C X Y Z) without it knowing that A B C even exist. Class C is only marked as "abstract" because it is <b>only</b> an abstraction for other things (rather than a concrete thing itself)<br/><br/>"Abstract" <b>methods</b> are even more misleading, because they imply that abstract means "implemented elsewhere". However, "abstract" here does not mean that the method <b>itself</b> is abstract, but that it is <b>only</b> (a <b>concrete</b>) part of the definition of the enclosing "abstract <b>class</b>" (e.g. "some object with an X Y Z location in 3D space").<br/><br/>Abstraction is when you draw a circle and say "this is my car", when in reality a car has many moving parts &amp; behaviors. In a program, it's representing your car as a few numbers (as part of a class or otherwise) because your program is only concerned with the car's position and speed.
