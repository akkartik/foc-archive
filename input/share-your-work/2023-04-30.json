I will say while your pseudonym reveals a bit about your bent and perspective, it does make me a bit sad to not know more of your background. You offer a perspective I appreciate greatly.\n\nDuring the recording of the epsiode, Ivan and I actually had quite a bit of a back and forth on the topic of your feedback(it didn’t make the cut though). My take is a bit different than Ivan’s (though I admit that I had to add Ivan’s feedback here to my “to read list” so I give the proper care it deserves).\n\nI hope you continue to give us push back on parts of the paper you feel we dismiss too quickly. I think this is important work. But I do want to address the meta-point here about respect.\n\nI believe very strongly that the only way to respect an author who puts forward an argument is to try and disagree with it. Now maybe this is my philosophical background, or maybe it is just that my Dad told me to question everything (much to the chagrin of my 1st grade teacher). But regardless of why, this is the way I approach all the works that we discuss on the podcast.\n\nNow just as Descartes was not hoping to end up doubting everything, my goals is not to disagree with everything. It is through disagreement that I come to learn and know what these authors are teaching me. Now perhaps we don’t always make it around to this point in the discussion. But I think even if we don’t, we get to model what these kinds of discussions can look like. What I hope gets through in these discussions is that this isn’t the final word. That our criticisms aren’t absolute, but a product of us struggling through the text. Struggling to understand, to appreciate.\n\nThere is one other element at play, that perhaps you might disagree with. I feel that in our (niche part of the) industry there is often unhealthy hero-worship. We often hold this great figures of our past properly in high-regard, but do so in such a way that prevents the very thing they hope to accomplish. In popular programming discourse, papers like the ones we cover are often reduced to sound bites devoid of their true context.\n\nTake for example Dijkstra’s notion of separation of concerns. It’s use in modern development has completely unmoored it from its context. It becomes a hammer that is applied and a principle fought for, rather than a tool for understanding.\n\nI want others to read these papers not as holy texts they must accept, but as papers which they can engage with. Papers they can learn from, they can disagree with, papers that are accessible to them. Papers they should read and re-read, papers they ought to revisit in light of new information. \n\nWill we ever do these papers full justice in one podcast episode? No. But I will never discuss a paper on the podcast that I don’t deeply respect. I am so happy we have listeners like you listening. I always am humbled when people who clearly know more than me listen to what I have to say.",
