Hi all, I just joined and found out about this because of <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dan Cook</span>'s website. My background is probably similar to all of yours, I'm fed up with the state of computing. I've worked for 18 years in the tech industry (Google, Amazon, and a start-up) and recently left the working world in order to slow down, read all of those books that have been piling up, and attack this problem without the troubles of trying to fit this into a money making enterprise. So, for now it's just me reading a lot, taking lots of notes, and doing a few small programming experiments.
