Most of what I write about on Codefaster is useful, but not Future of Coding grad changing how people think about code, but my latest series definitely qualifies.<br/>It's about a completely new testing methodology that doesn't use "tests as functions with asserts" like every other testing methodology I've seen, but tests as JSON data.<br/><br/>The coolest part about it? When tests are json data, the computer can generate the "expected test output" for you automatically, so all you need to do is specify the test and the computer fills out what it "should be." Then as a human, you can just verify it with your eyeballs (and in many cases, another program) and not have to type it out or extract correct answers from assert messages.<br/><a href="https://codefaster.substack.com/p/wicked-fast-testing-part-1">https://codefaster.substack.com/p/wicked-fast-testing-part-1</a>

Dope. I love it. I've been thinking for a while that I should write an extension to  my repl capturing the previous statement and adding it + the result as an assert to my test suite. This is slightly different, but similar idea.

This seems to be the same thing as Snapshots in Jest (<a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing">https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing</a>)? They are mostly described in the context of testing UI in their docs, but they can easily be used for snapshoting anything that is serializable.<br/>From what I learned so far, they are good for a situation where you want to ensure that a specific part of the system does not change its outputs, but you don't want to describe those outputs manually, usually because they are too complex for that. It is not there to replace the classical TDD, but to complement it for these specific situations.

Yeah, it's very similar to jest snapshots, especially the extremely valuable --updateSnapshot feature. In practice, Wicked Fast Testing has a slight edge because the tests are json rather than js code. You can use a program like jq to skip arbitrary tests and generate test data directly.

Also, super importantly, since the test data is JSON, Wicked Fast Testing can be implemented in any language in ~20 lines, unlike jest which is JS only
