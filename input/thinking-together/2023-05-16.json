We want to be able to define new data types and mappings between them. And we’d like system to provide interfaces for interacting with that, querying over it, visualising, joining. Sometimes we’d like to tweak visualisations or provide new classes of visualisation, but its more important, imho, that the system can “find” the appropriate visualisations from the data types and their operations.\n\nThis matters because as data types and operations each grow out fairly linearly with our effort to extend a system, the visualisation of of that I think must grow out at least something like quadratically.
