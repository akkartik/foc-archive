        "text": "*Text is still visual*, unless read aloud (another benefit to text is that it can be read; diagrams cannot). When I read text (both books and code), I form my own emotions and graphs mentally. The Harry Potter series was famous for sparking powerful visuals while reading. Harry Potter had no images, no diagrams yet the readers created a world around them. When I read an OSS library that I did not write, I navigate through the code like a story; building my own visual understanding of the domain and usage.\nHarry Potter turned into a movie, which may have cut the imagination of the original plot in half. If you diagram a code base, from my experience, you lose more than half of the understanding\/context which needs to be put behind menues, tooltips and other UI complexity.\n\n<@U6FKVSVCK> you say the Bonsai book was far from programming… yet it has conditions, variables, error catching and other logical concepts very well articulated in text. It’s an analogy, and I think a pretty good one. You’ll love my Harry Potter one above :wink:\n\nOn the topic of visual thinkers — It’s naive to think that anyone can create the same visual constructs that every visual person understands. The way I visualize complex logic *is not* the same as how You visualize it. Just like how we have a hundred programming languages focusing on different complexities; visuals are the same. There is great depths and domains to tackle — there is no universally understood graph\/visual. I’m deeply concerns for those building visual tools for that reason alone: the way they see the visual space is not ubiquitous, and I would argue more unique than text. My argument is based off research and discussions with individuals in this FoC as well as leaders in the industry. I won’t name them, but there are several companies that understand their visual representations of logic *must* change as their product is just as confusing as programming is today… it’s just shinier.",

When I read an OSS library that I did not write, I navigate through the code like a story; building my own visual understanding of the domain and usage.\nHarry Potter turned into a movie, which may have cut the imagination of the original plot in half.

Both language and visual representations make use of these building blocks to enable sensemaking and reasoning. I find that extremely interesting and so far I couldn’t find much work that transfers these already several decades-old insights from cognitive science to our field — which is why I‘m bullish on there being some interesting ideas ripe for experimentation.",
