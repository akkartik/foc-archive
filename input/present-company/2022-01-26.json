Don't have listings posted yet, but I'm happy to look at portfolios and start having calls now.\n\nOne is just a fairly standard Rails backend or fullstack dev position. The app is about 24k lines that I wrote the entirety of (design to backend), and I'd love to have help adding features, improving perf, updating the design, and otherwise making all parts better as we grow.\n\nThe other is a contract position to design and prototype an artist-focused interactive schematic-building tool. This is one of those _I soooo want to do this myself, but demands of business require that I farm it out_. It should be a fun one for someone who likes building app prototypes that are focused on graphics and UI-feel.\n\nBoth positions are full-time, remote from anywhere (so long as you have a few hours overlapping daytime in North America).\n\nYes, introductions would be great. I can be reached at <mailto:ivan@cdiginc.com|ivan@cdiginc.com> or by DM here.",

Don't have listings posted yet, but I'm happy to look at portfolios and start having calls now.\n\nOne is just a fairly standard Rails backend or fullstack dev position. The app is about 24k lines that I wrote the entirety of (design to backend), and I'd love to have help adding features, improving perf, updating the design, and otherwise making all parts better as we grow.\n\nThe other is a contract position to design and prototype an artist-focused interactive schematic-building tool. This is one of those "
