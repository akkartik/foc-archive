Hi everyone, I found this group recently through a HN comment / Steve’s site, and have been very much enjoying following all the great conversations going on here! My academic background is maths, so I’m not super strong on the compsci theoretical side, but I learnt coding from my dad, and then through doing dev work for charities for some years I stumbled into many similar beliefs to those expressed here. In particular I’m very interested in the ‘coding for non-coders’ endeavour, e.g. FRP, excel-like systems, user empowerment etc. I’ve been working on a new language in this vein over the past year, and am excited to see what you guys think - I’ll share in the feedback channel :slightly_smiling_face:
