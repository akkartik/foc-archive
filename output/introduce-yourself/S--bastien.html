Hi there! I'm Sébastien and am currently based in Montréal (moving to Wellington, NZ in a few months). I've been interested in PL design since late 90s and have created a few transpilers ([Sugar](<a href="https://github.com/sebastien/sugar">https://github.com/sebastien/sugar</a>), [Sugar 2](<a href="https://github.com/sebastien/sugar2">https://github.com/sebastien/sugar2</a>), [PAML](<a href="https://github.com/sebastien/paml">https://github.com/sebastien/paml</a>), [PCSS](<a href="https://github.com/sebastien/pcss]">https://github.com/sebastien/pcss]</a> as well as underlying tools/libraries like [LambdaFactory](<a href="https://github.com/sebastien/lambdafactory">https://github.com/sebastien/lambdafactory</a>) and [Libparsing](<a href="https://github.com/sebastien/libparsing">https://github.com/sebastien/libparsing</a>)). My background is primarily in software engineering, but I also have studied design and have worked at the intersection of both creating interactive data-visualizations and data-rich interfaces at [FFunction](<a href="https://ffctn.com">https://ffctn.com</a>)<br/><br/>I'm currently working on two PL-related projects at the moment: Curved, a visual editor for the Curv Language by Doug Moen (who's also on this forum) and TLang, a language for incremental tree processing to build compilers, build systems, reactive user interfaces, databases and other applications that rely heavily on a graph structure.<br/><br/>I'm very interested in the topics of visual programming and how programming languages/paradigms shape our mental model, and I'm particularly interested in the technical topics of parsing, abstract program model/program representation and data structure synthesis (all of which, you can guess, are quite useful in building modern compilers!).
