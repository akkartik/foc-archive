Hi folks!<br/><br/>I developed following webapp a few years ago and although I was (and still am) quite excited about the possibilities, I never released it. I couldn't imagine the programming community at large get excited about it. Also I was sick of preaching things nobody else seems to care about.<br/><br/>But now that I discovered this community, maybe a few of you might like it:<br/><br/><a href="https://syvis.surge.sh/ErZoPhsMTcDvGT9pZswo/">https://syvis.surge.sh/ErZoPhsMTcDvGT9pZswo/</a><br/>Feel free to try it out with other JavaScript code. It completely runs in your Browser!<br/><br/>My thought process was that -- despite their flaws -- text editors are a quite powerful input method once you mastered the keyboard.<br/>Consuming / investigating code in a text editor, however, not so. Our syntax highlighting, code style guides, indentation based code, etc. are just a desperate attempt to mitigate this.<br/><br/>What if coding was more like writing a LaTeX paper? The LaTeX code is good to build the document, and for reviewing and distributing it, the rendered PDF is much better suited.<br/><br/>Next steps could be:<br/><br/>- Custom themes, so that you can render the code to you liking<br/>- Enable interactive editing for minor things like changing a number or a  string, reordering parts, …<br/><br/>Here is another abstract from a slightly different angle:<br/><br/>In most programming languages<br/>the semantic meaning of a program is disconnected from<br/>the formatting of the code and the naming of variables and keywords.<br/>This means semantically equivalent code can be written in a vastly<br/>different textual representations.<br/>This poses problems in terms of readability and understandability<br/>of code.<br/>Even minor modifications of punctuation or formatting in comparison to<br/>a developers familiar style can drastically decrease the performance.<br/>In order to mitigate these problems I propose to visualize code<br/>in a graphical and deterministic way.<br/>Instead of relying on the author of the code to format it in a acceptable<br/>manner, each developer can choose a visualization of their liking.<br/>This has the potential to decrease the error rate and<br/>increase the development speed of programmers.<br/><br/>Looking foward to you feedback! :grin:

Really cool! The visual representation using colored blocks reminds me of the Greenfoot / Stride environment. On a first look, it's hard to see whether such a representation is more readable than current code, but that's most likely my own bias.<br/>I'd really like more "graphical" code representations. Non-monospace fonts, more flexible whitespace, "rendered" documentation (like md cells in Jupyer notebooks), intelligent line wrapping or even real 2D layouts would be possible. <br/>Many people (me included) have previously tried to make Structure Editors to achieve more graphical representations, but it's really hard to even get OK-isch usability. <br/>I really like your idea of using text for modifications and a rendered view for reading code.

I like it too! Nice try into representing text code as visual structure. It reminds me Alice programming language. And, of course, etoys too. I see these kinds of representation the natural useful intermediates between text code and more higher abstract representations of programming artifacts.

The best part is those notations are just part of the Stylesheet. So you could use your own theme to modify or change them entirely

Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Felix Kohlgrüber</span> and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@nicolas decoster</span> for the nice words :relaxed:.<br/>… and wow, the Greenfoot Frames system is eerily similar. Definitely need to check it out in more detail. Thanks for the pointer.<br/><br/>&gt; it's hard to see whether such a representation is more readable than current code<br/><br/>Of course it needs some getting used to. If you never had seen code before it would be highly unreadable and off-putting.  I definitely noticed how it got much easier for me to see the patterns and make sense of the code during the development.<br/><br/>Since the design is only definied by a CSS stylesheet I'd be really interested in seeing other people's take on how the code should be rendered!<br/><br/>I've dabbled with structural editors as well and I think it will be incredible hard to impossible with normal programming languages and our current input methods. With a custom build programming language and novel input techniques e.g. touchscreen of immersive VR environments it might be possible.<br/>This could be a good intermediate step.

It is a nice looking representation. Colorful, nicely indented, pleasing. But I don't think this visualization helps much in terms of understanding what a program does.. It is what a program does to the data that is its true meaning; an IF statement is nothing more than a fork in the road, whether you do A or B must matter somehow or the programmer wouldn't have put it in.  It is when, why and what happens, 3 of the "biggies" in journalism that is missing from the visualization, and i would suggest you augment the flow of the execution on top of this representation to get somewhere, and either show values or link to values.

It's very hard for me to parse what's going on, but this is coming from a guy who uses 24pt+ font.  I think the text doesn't stand out from the other formatting contextual information enough.  Less is more; I bet I'd like it more if you deemphasized syntactic cues and doubled down on semantic cues.

This has some similarities yet in some ways is the opposite of Lamdu. Lamdu displays the code in a more mere textual style (without additional frames) but is a structural editor that tries to mimic text-editing in its look and feel (while using this to provide benefits like a better interface for type errors etc)

One could argue that editing LaTeX code but looking at rendered pdfs is a flaw not a feature. LaTeX editors try to mitigate this by live rendering the document on the side, but this is still not ideal, because your cursor is on the left in the code and you're looking at the rendered pdf on the right. Some editors even show the cursor position in the rendered pdf. In the limit this seems to converge to showing all relevant information as an overlay in the rendered pdf, including the document tree, making the code view on the left side redundant.<br/><br/>If you have a code viewer that displays code in a superior way, then it seems to me that you'd want to use that view while editing as well.

I've been thinking that variable (and function) declarations should be displayed differently from usages (and calls) so I was happy to see that here. And I think in some cases showing blocks with a border and a different background color works well, e.g. to show where functions begin/end. I think the mapping from the stylized representation to JS is a bit confusing though, e.g. why change "x = 0" to "x : 0"? And I'd prefer to see colors used for semantics more than syntax, e.g. one color for "standard library stuff" and another for "calls to linear algebra functions" and a third for "my graphics code". Or, alternately, one color for reading, one for mutation, one for function calls, etc...
