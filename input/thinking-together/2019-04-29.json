(Sorry about all the notifications &lt;= credit where due. Broken into a few messages due to message length limits.)\n\n&gt; <@UEQ6M68H0> very few languages today include FSM syntax, even though it is one of the key fundamental components of every program. Also, in every real-world FSM you have the possibility that one of the steps will fail. Having a system fail softly on a key step failing is a very interesting aspect neglected in most languages.\n\nWarm take: Any new [visual?] language worth its salt should include a simple, generic FSM facility as part of the standard library.\n\n&gt; <@U5STGTB3J> [...] an abstract graph, with generic arrows, their positions and lengths without meaning, pointing from and to equally as dimensionless boxes, all floating in a space that has no meaningful coordinates either — you can move things around and it doesn’t change anything other than the visualization.\n\nIt feels like there's another shoe yet to drop, when it comes to the design of VPLs — even the boring, traditional \"node-and-arrow\" ones. Giving the graphical characteristics of a visual language heightened meaning, representation, and dynamism is easily imaginable, and under-explored (evidence to the contrary heartily welcomed — I'll add it to the codex). So why don't we have it yet? One theory: used to be a painfully high bar for creating dynamic visual environments, but the explosive advancement of video game authoring tools is really lowering that bar. I mean.. have y'all played SpaceChem? Despite its intentionally constrained GUI (it is a game, after all), it's richer with metaphor than any VPL I've yet laid my mouse on.\n\n&gt; <@UE1JQM9HQ> it’s also important to distinguish between the way we write and the way we understand code. Whenever we talk about programming languages, we tend to conflate the two. The code is always consumed in the same shape it’s written in. I believe that is unnecessarily limiting.\n\nThis is probably my favourite reason to be optimistic about visual languages. With a text language, programmers would not tolerate the structure of their program being changed willy-nilly by their IDE. You expect the code to execute in the order it's written, within the scope it's declared, conveyed by the file you've allotted to it. With a visual language, programmers could be more permissive of wild alterations of structure and substance of the code _in flagrante_, including things like: which connections actually exist, how visual code-elements are laid out, how many &amp; which names are assigned to a given thing, whether data may only flow along programmer-established paths, what data is present in the system, whether the execution model should be deterministic or not, and so forth. Why more permissive? Both for the cultural reason that this is uncharted territory free of the spectre of entrenched norms, and for the technical reason that visual communication allows a plurality of representations of the same fundamental thing, all of which can be treated as variably \"real\" or \"virtual\". The artifact of writing does not allow this flexibility — at most, it has typography; there's no \"impressionistic\" lettering versus \"abstract\" lettering, outside of concrete poetry.\n\nAgain, the space of _powerful system-building interfaces with shifting representations of the system_ has been best explored by video games (as a whole — not any specific game). But it's also been very well explored by 3D modelling\/animation tools, which must show many, many different-but-mostly-equivalent representations of their data, all of which with subtly different degrees to which a detail is \"real\" or \"virtual\". All existing visual language GUIs (*That I've seen — counterexamples welcome) seem starved by comparison.",

And anyone saying \"In text languages, we have _names_, which (while sometimes problematic) are more powerful than arrows\" is missing the fact that VPLs also use names: to name \"functions\" (whatever form they take), to name \"parameters\" (ditto), and sometimes even to name variables\/data representations\/abstractions. In a rich VPL, names are used to great effect. In this way, the visual languages are a superset of the text languages.\n\n...\n\nZooming out for a sec — we should all make sure we're looking at the implied higher points found by ascending from the local maxima of the best existing languages (text, visual, what have you) when discussing paradigms. The line of reasoning, \"Most ______ have sucked, therefore we shouldn't bother anymore with _____\" inhibits progress. Yes, most boxes-and-arrows languages have sucked. _But a few of them are fucking phenomenal._ When we speak of text languages, we're all proceeding with the tacit assumption that APL &amp; Idris &amp; Racket &amp; other \"great languages\" are our baseline, not Pascal &amp; SPARC assembly &amp; xBase. Since we're here to study and create something better than the best of what currently exists, we shouldn't mire ourselves in the bottom of the barrel wrestling over which bad thing is most indicative of the failings of its class.\n\n...\n\n&gt; <@UCGAK10LS> Two major dimensions are *composition* and *choice*. Almost every language construct in any *functional* language is just a combination of these. Function application, function composition, product types, and sum types are just different flavours of composition. If-expressions, case-expressions, and pattern matching are all just different flavours of choice.\n\n[vibrant whirring noises coming from our brains as we take in all our favourite language constructs with these fresh eyes]\n\n&gt; <@UCGAK10LS> But either way, it's not up to a disbeliever to prove the absence of something; it's up to a believer to prove its existence.\n\nWorking on that.",
