Hi, friends!<br/><br/>I'm a former software developer turned computational artist, previously from Sydney and now in LA. Finally getting on here after meeting some lovely people at the Ink &amp; Switch unconf.<br/><br/>Programming has been a part of me for basically my entire life, but what it means to me has changed a lot over time. From "it's for fun and curiosity" to "it's for making stuff" to "it's for beautiful and powerful feats of engineering" to "it's for making beautiful things whether or not they're useful" to "oh that's art actually", which will hopefully someday lead me back to "it's for fun and curiosity" again.<br/><br/>I've felt spiritually connected to the FoC-verse for a long time, which (like most people here I'm assuming) began because almost every moment I spend interacting with a computer I'm trying not to breathe in all the wasted potential. That said, these days my interest is more in the potential of computation as an artistic medium, so I'm looking at creative and alternative models of computation more through the lens of "what's beautiful and meaningful?" than "what's more useful and less maddening?"<br/><br/>I used to post lil screen recordings of things I made on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/sgentle">@sgentle</a><a href="https://twitter.com/sgentle))">)</a>, these days I'm mostly on Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/_sgentle">@_sgentle</a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/_sgentle))">)</a> and trying to get started on Mastodon (<a href="https://mastodon.social/@sgentle">@sgentle@mastodon.social</a><a href="https://mastodon.social/@sgentle))">)</a>. I have <a href="https://x.com/sgentle/status/1092414959877640192">a whole lot</a> of <a href="https://x.com/sgentle/status/1028376365614030848">half-finished</a> <a href="https://x.com/sgentle/status/1095355139534143489">unreleased stuff</a> from my making-art-but-don't-know-it transitional period that I'm still figuring out what to do with, but sometime soon hopefully I should start putting them somewhere. Meanwhile, here are a few actually released things: <a href="https://demos.samgentle.com/flourish/">Flourish</a>, <a href="https://demos.samgentle.com/automata-by-example/">Automata by Example</a>, <a href="https://demos.samgentle.com/markov-contact/">Markov Contact</a>.<br/><br/>I spent a while being kinda isolated and it didn't work so well, so now I'm trying the other one. Definitely reach out if anything I've said seems interesting, you're into art/tech type things, or you just feel inexplicably drawn to weird and beautiful forms of computation :)
