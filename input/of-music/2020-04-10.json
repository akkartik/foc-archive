Zep has zero dependencies; it just requires a C++14 compiler and links to no libraries.  The core library is all you need - and a header to either create an ImGui backend or a Qt one.   The demo application has dependencies because it has features such as Orca, and uses SDL to create a window etc; but these aren't things you need if dropping it into your own application.  I will see if I can clarify the readme.",
