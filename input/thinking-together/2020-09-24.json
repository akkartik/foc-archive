But I've also been white boarding through ideas on how to help with this in the current world. Not sure I could summarize well the ways I want to actually help this problem here, but I do want to at least contribute a few meta thoughts.\n\nFirst I think one really important thing to consider is if we can in fact recover the important parts of a programs history at all. Peter Naur in his paper \"Programming as Theory Building\" claims that re-establishing the theory of a dead program is strictly impossible. I'm sure so people might question this, but I think this is actually very important to consider. If we aim at trying to save a history, we have to consider our aims. If our goal is to recover the theory behind the program that could be a fools errand. Instead maybe we should be thinking about what parts of a programs history are important for helping us establish a new theory? Does that history have to be an actual history or could it be something like what is proposed in the talk \"Idealized Commit Logs\" (<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dSqLt8BgbRQ>)?\n\nSecond I think we actually should really consider learning more from historians, particular historians of artifacts (like art history). There is a great book on art history methodology called Patterns of Intention by Michael Baxandall. One of the points he makes is that when we are describing art, we are converting something visual to something linguistic. This is a lossy and biased format, one easy example he gives us that paintings don't actually a beginning and end point. We have to choose how to describe it and where to start. When we are studying art works, we are really studying them under some description of them. (He makes this much clearer for of us who are not artistically inclined by starting with a history of the forth bridge. His history of this artifacts asks as a really interesting example into what goes into an historical explanation.)\n\nI think these same things hold true for programs. In capturing a history, we can't just be recording facts in a database, we are interpreting those facts, selecting the relevant ones and determining an order. What sorts of facts, in what sorts of orders can help people gain a new theory? Will different interpretations click better with different people? What things do we exclude by selecting that facts in this way? Is the loss worth the pay off?\n\n&gt; What are some ways in which programming environments could help us record this info \/ answer these questions without requiring additional effort from the author?\nI think this is particularly interesting. We all know that getting people to provide documentation is hard. It is even harder to make that documentation good. Short of completely automatic though, what if we could make this easier? What if we could make it more part of your current flow? What if you didn't have to leave your editor, but you also didn't have to mess up the code by leaving some big huge long comment in the middle of things?\n\nWhat if you could decide that something was a good example for later and save it off with a single button press? What if you could make tours through your code bases, or document in those code bases various ways the data flows? What if you could make an interactive introduction to codebase.\n\nI think these are the sorts of starting points we should consider. Once we can make these things work and work well manually, then we can start plugging in automations, start making automatic curation.",
