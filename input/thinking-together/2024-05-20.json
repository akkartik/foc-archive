In the early days, when there wasn’t enough RAM for a full-screen bitmap frame buffer, character glyphs and sprites were brought in from ROM.

NeWS (capable of rendering circular windows)\n• I remember the name Alain Fournier being associated with the transition from clunky graphics to realistic graphics (did he say anything of interest to the above question?)\nFWIW:\n• \"vector\" beams came from the way that cathode ray tubes (oscilloscopes and TV) and raster scanning worked\n• I blame the use of fixed-sized grids of non-overlapping small bitmaps (\"characters\") on Gutenberg and the use of clay tablets and papyrus mixed in with the concepts of arrays of bits (i.e. digital memory)\n• rows and columns of input switches were used in IBM Selectric typewriters and keyboards which naturally led to the idea of rows and columns of core memory bits, dot-matrix printing and output pixels. 7-segment displays led to grids of pixels-on-a-chip, etc. The key being optimization of pin count by using row\/column addressing instead of direct pixel addressing, the same optimization used in PLCs.\n• the epitome of row\/column addressing was the invention of the CPU chip attached to Random Access Memory, IMO\n• I think that we're only beginning to use scalable vector graphics in the form of SVG and variants of XML\n(... asking a more-knowledgable friend about this question ...)",
