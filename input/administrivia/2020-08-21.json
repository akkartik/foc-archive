(Middle of the workday for me, so if anyone has questions, I'll follow-up down the road.)\n\nSteve's first 10-ish posts to the community were purely evangelizing StoryScript, without responding to the substance of any conversations he participated in. I reached out to him then, and asked him to engage more, and not just use the community for eyeballs.\n\nHe then went on to engage very deeply, offering fantastic responses to a wide variety of threads and (so I've heard) having a number of powerful and helpful discussions with people in private.\n\nBut, whenever Steve asked for feedback about StoryScript, there was a disconnect in the discussions. Steve seemed frustrated at the kind of feedback he was getting. He said to me, in public and in private, that he didn't want to engage in this community unless we did a better job of meeting his needs.\n\nThat frustration is on clear display in <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/CCL5VVBAN\/p1597966470010300|this thread> from today.\n\nGiven that this was a recurring thing, not just a one-off, and that he'd long been using the threat of leaving the community to gain conversational leverage, I asked him to see himself out.\n\nSimply put: what we have going on here isn't what he wanted, and his way of trying to get what he wanted out of us didn't work.",

(Middle of the workday for me, so if anyone has questions, I'll follow-up down the road.)\n\nSteve's first 10-ish posts to the community were purely evangelizing StoryScript, without responding to the substance of any conversations he participated in. I reached out to him then, and asked him to engage more, and not just use the community for eyeballs.\n\nHe then went on to engage very deeply, offering fantastic responses to a wide variety of threads and (so I've heard) having a number of powerful and helpful discussions with people in private.\n\nBut, whenever Steve asked for feedback about StoryScript, there was a disconnect in the discussions. Steve seemed frustrated at the kind of feedback he was getting. He said to me, in public and in private, that he didn't want to engage in this community unless we did a better job of meeting his needs.\n\nThat frustration is on clear display in "

Nobody here has vision, and nobody is willing to criticize my work. I have invested a lot of my time and have not received enough value in return. I think I'm going to leave.\"\n\nEach time, I tried to talk to him about why he felt this way, offer him some of the very direct feedback he asked for (doing my best to focus on the work, keep it actionable, do _critique_ rather than mere _criticism_). He seemed to appreciate it, and respond well to the energy of it. But none of the substance of my comments ever seemed to make it through — exactly like what you see in that thread from today. It wasn't what he wanted to hear, so he didn't hear it.\n\n(As an illustrative example: early on in the thread today, he asked us to tell him if his explanation was unclear. Multiple people responded saying _this is unclear... and here's my best effort at what I think it is_. He responded with frustration at the best-effort guesses, never offering any clarity. This is exactly the pattern that played out in all my discussions with him.)\n\nEvery time he reached out to me, I felt as though he was talking to me about these frustrations because he wanted me to make an appeal to him, to prove to him that this community was worth his time. All the while, he'd be quite dynamic and engaging and offer plenty of cheer in public, in contrast to his private frustrations.\n\nI got the impression that he wanted me to run this community more like an incubator \/ accelerator. More activity, more ambition, less concern about hurt feelings, move fast and break things. He has other communities like that. What our community has, that his other ones probably don't, is deep technical \/ subject expertise. From his post above (emphasis added):\n\n&gt; My intention to participate here was to share ideas, join in constructive criticism, and participate in debate which I was hoping would result in finding like minds *that would work with our team — in short: recruiting.* This may be against the policies of this community (I’m not clear on that) which I’m sorry for crossing the line if people felt I was advertising a product or exclusively looking to recruit.",

This is exactly the pattern that played out in all my discussions with him.)\n\nEvery time he reached out to me, I felt as though he was talking to me about these frustrations because he wanted me to make an appeal to him, to prove to him that this community was worth his time. All the while, he'd be quite dynamic and engaging and offer plenty of cheer in public, in contrast to his private frustrations.\n\nI got the impression that he wanted me to run this community more like an incubator \/ accelerator. More activity, more ambition, less concern about hurt feelings, move fast and break things. He has other communities like that. What our community has, that his other ones probably don't, is deep technical \/ subject expertise. From his post above (emphasis added):\n\n"
