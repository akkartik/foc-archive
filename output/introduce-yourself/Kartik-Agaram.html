Hi everyone! Lately I tend to introduce myself as a barbarian programmer. I mean that in a few different ways:<br/><br/>• I tend to be a curmudgeon, happier by myself than "organizing" into groups to achieve some shared goal. This doesn't mean I dislike collaboration. I just think we tend to conflate collaboration with <em>synchronous</em> collaboration, and asynchronous collaboration is a better fit for many tasks. Asynchronous collaboration can span great distances in space and time. You reading Aristotle could be asynchronous collaboration -- if you are then able to build on what you read in some way and put out some artifact that someone else can collaborate with. UX people like to say "don't make me think". I like to say "don't make me talk to you". Show me what you built in a form that I can read, listen to, play interactively with and gradually understand/appreciate. I may still come talk to you if the situation merits it (I actually love talking to people, believe it or not), but give me the choice.<br/>• I think we've been doing city-living cheek-by-jowl for so long that we've forgotten what benefits it has, and continue cargo-culting it long after it's become superfluous. I don't mean that literally; I love living in cities. But our software stacks have many of the same patterns as cities, and they aren't really necessary: a) promiscuously adding dependencies, b) relying implicitly on some sort of division of labor, so that if we find a problem in a dependency we don't feel empowered to fix it for ourselves, instead turning to ways to try to get others to do it for us like paying, bullying, cajoling, passing laws, etc. It's worth swinging that pendulum back a bit, to imagine we're out on the steppe with just what we have on our backs and nobody else around for miles, and try to achieve our ends with 10x fewer libraries and frameworks. (More details: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16882140#16882555">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16882140#16882555</a> .)<br/>• It emphasizes sustainability. When you live off the land (I gather; I wouldn't actually know) you are more attuned to how you affect your environment. Your <em>externalities</em>. We city dwellers just expect someone else to cart our trash out for us.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this is all aspirational, because the way we write software doesn't really work for a barbarian. I've been working very slowly on extricating a kernel of software and way of writing software that can be more self-sufficient and sustainable. I started out building a new programming language based on Lisp (<a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart">http://akkartik.name/post/wart</a>, which itself grew out of a startup; those who can't startup shave yaks), then grew frustrated with the stack below me and simultaneously realized languages don't matter, and build a toy VM and OS (<a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu#readme">https://github.com/akkartik/mu#readme</a> ; <a href="http://akkartik.name/about">http://akkartik.name/about</a>), used it to teach programming for a couple of years, then grew frustrated with how slow it was and gradually faced up to the need to understand even more low-level details. Lately I've been building simple tools for programming in machine code (<a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu/tree/master/subx#readme">https://github.com/akkartik/mu/tree/master/subx#readme</a>), but in the past week I've set this aside to design a type-safe language that I can bootstrap out of machine code (no link yet).

On a tangent, I <em>love</em> the idea of mentioning favorite forums/watering holes in one's introduction. Can densely convey a lot of intangible information to just the right people. I used to do it a few years ago, but fell off the wagon. Thanks for the reminder!
