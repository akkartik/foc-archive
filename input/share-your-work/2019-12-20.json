The hypothesis of the project is that visual programming languages are easy, but not powerful. By powerful, I mean a language can be used to solve large and complex problems. As a stepping stone, the immediate goal of the project is to create a visual programming language (VPL) that's powerful, but not necessarily easy for beginners. After demonstrating a powerful VPL, the next step would be a VPL that's both easy for beginners _and_ powerful. Since the short term goal is just to make a powerful VPL, Glance is currently more targeted at experienced programmers, so while it would be nice to have syntax that's easy for beginners, that's not a priority.\n\nI believe there's already a lot of evidence that VPLs are good for beginners, so right now the Glance project is focused on the question of whether powerful VPLs are possible, and not whether visual programing is better than textual programming.
