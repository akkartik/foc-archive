What I care about is scientific data and models in my work, and e-mails, e-books, contacts, music etc. otherwise. A computer for me is a tool to work with digital information, with the information being more important than the tool. Much of today's digital information is held hostage by code. This covers proprietary data formats, overly complex or undocumented data formats, and information absorbed by (and hidden in) software source code. For the specific case of scientific models, I have written a whole article about this issue: <https:\/\/f1000research.com\/articles\/3-101\/v2>.",

What I care about is scientific data and models in my work, and e-mails, e-books, contacts, music etc. otherwise. A computer for me is a tool to work with digital information, with the information being more important than the tool. Much of today's digital information is held hostage by code. This covers proprietary data formats, overly complex or undocumented data formats, and information absorbed by (and hidden in) software source code. For the specific case of scientific models, I have written a whole article about this issue: "

Here's an example from the readme, slightly reindented:\n```MANY blog_posts {\n  id, title, body,\n  comments: MANY comments {\n    id, body,\n    author: ONE users {\n      name\n    },\n  }\n}```\n…and yes, as shown in the readme, the response is a whole tree as JSON.\n\nre: how to do live queries: this code path: :stuck_out_tongue: <https:\/\/github.com\/vilterp\/treesql\/blob\/master\/pkg\/live_queries.go#L94-L101>\nBasically, when a live query is first run, it saves \"listeners\" in a special data structure in memory. Later, when writes come in, we look up those listeners, find live queries interested in that write, and push it out to them.\n\nThere's nothing that makes it fundamentally easier to do that in a document store than in a relational database. CockroachDB (where I work) is built on top of a key-value store, as are document DBs, and we have one of the building blocks of live queries: changefeeds (<https:\/\/www.cockroachlabs.com\/docs\/stable\/create-changefeed.html>), a way of getting a feed of writes going into the DB. The tricky part is mapping these writes to the queries that would be interested in them — i.e. \"a comment with blog post id 5 was inserted =&gt; these 11 queries covered blog post 5, so they'd want to know about this\"",
