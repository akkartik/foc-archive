        "text": "Here is something I've been working on for a while that I've finally figured out how to do. You draw rectangles in the plane and 'transclusions' between them. Transclusions produce copies which display only in the target. Transclusions copy rectangles to produce new (cropped) rectangles. Transclusions also copy copied rectangles. Additionally, transclusions copy transclusions, which in turn copies transclusions and rectangles as well. Because rectangles can be moved around and resized every transclusion copies every rectangle and every transclusion ad infinitum at all times (though currently we stop after four steps). You can think of this structure as something like a syntax tree whose pieces can be moved in and out continuously at will, and two way transclusions as a kind of symbolic variable with the symbol missing. The math behind all this is really interesting too, but I probably don't want to go on about that here.\n(cc <@U05M5A8E0NT> and <@U03R0B9U1GD>, thanks for inspiring me to think about rectangles and affine transformations! Also cc <@U6KQ2S410> since transclusions are very similar to inclusions from First Class Copy and Paste.)\n<https:\/\/youtu.be\/iGHphz-NbBI>",
