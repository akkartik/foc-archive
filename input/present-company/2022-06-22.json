The idea is that actions in the game can have real world effects, like turning on the lights. (Gig is US-only unfortunately, due to grant funding restrictions).\n\nPrototype overview:\n• basic single player 2D platformer mechanics (move, jump, item\/platform interactions)\n• browser based interface built with PixiJS or Three.js\n• deployed on local network; server controls light bulbs via LIFX LAN API\n• remappable keyboard\/mouse controls\n• three short levels showing basic navigation, control of in-game lights, and control of LIFX lights\n• basic in-game level editor mode\nWe’re looking for someone who’s handy with a WebGL framework like PixiJS or Three.js. Even though this prototype will be fairly simple, experience developing &amp; deploying a fast-paced multiplayer game is a plus, as it’s important for interactions to be fluid and game state\/networking to be robust. If the future of coding tie-in isn’t immediately apparent, don’t worry I can talk your ear off about that :smile:. Let me know if you’re interested or know someone who might be!
