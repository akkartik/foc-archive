We discovered that 90% of people downloading it don't get through the first steps – our onboarding and guidance sucks and we are working on it right now. Fixing it will take us a few weeks.\n\nSo, we come to an idea to manually onboard users by building any data analytics \/ data-driven process automation for companies that they need (for free and with no additional license cost - our product is Open Source and Free on Desktop usage). Our product, Enso (<https:\/\/enso.org>) is really powerful - think of it like about Alteryx (<https:\/\/alteryx.com>, $500M ARR), but more interactive, with better visualisations, and worse onboarding.\n\n**I would be very, very thankful for any advice on how to find \/ reach out to companies who might benefit from using Enso and would allow us to grow the user base faster. Would you mind sharing some ideas?** :)",

Unfortunately, one big caveat for slightly larger projects was how you'd get so many default variable names that started to make anything long unwieldy. The text\/visual syntax is cool, but the default naming scheme and even in the tutorials suggesting you to just link nodes (thus creating a ton of `operator7` etc.) means that you lose a lot of semantic meaning when going back to understand the code.\n\nJust like how using single characters for all your variables in standard languages is bad practice, this default naming really gets in the way of maintaining and understanding code - a problem that the visual interface was supposed to solve, not introduce. I'm sure there could be interesting ideas of working around it (direct links convert to pipe-like syntax, only when multiple nodes refer to the same one is a name prompted for, etc.)",

Unfortunately, one big caveat for slightly larger projects was how you'd get so many default variable names that started to make anything long unwieldy. The text\/visual syntax is cool, but the default naming scheme and even in the tutorials suggesting you to just link nodes (thus creating a ton of "

I'm sure there could be interesting ideas of working around it (direct links convert to pipe-like syntax, only when multiple nodes refer to the same one is a name prompted for, etc.)"
