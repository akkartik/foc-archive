        "text": "To <@UJBAJNFLK> question, I believe all of these environments can dynamically execute code to change their environment (I'm not 100% sure about VS Code, but defintely Vim and Emacs, and I actually wrote a plugin to do this myself in Atom <https:\/\/atom.io\/packages\/run-in-atom>). With that said, I don't think any of these environments provide special functionality for reloading a whole extension at once? Although that theoretically should be possible. Personally, I find dynamic load great for experimenting, but not as good for building things because it's too common to end up with something that works in your current application state, but that fails when run you restart your environment. I've found a better approach to be excellent state restoration and a really fast startup time, so you can close and re-load your environment and be right where you left off very quickly. (I'd be very interested in hearing if people have had different experiences with that though!)",

Although that theoretically should be possible. Personally, I find dynamic load great for experimenting, but not as good for building things because it's too common to end up with something that works in your current application state, but that fails when run you restart your environment. I've found a better approach to be excellent state restoration and a really fast startup time, so you can close and re-load your environment and be right where you left off very quickly. (I'd be very interested in hearing if people have had different experiences with that though!)"

They were probably talking about the CAN Bus systems in the car. CAN Bus is the protocol that computerized subsystems use to communicate, with each subsystem being a node on the bus.

In vehicles, similarly to Erlang, you want to be able to maximally continue operation in the event of catastrophic, and typically _physical,_ failure of any nodes or the network itself — things like cables being cut or a liquid being spilled on one of your chips or contacts corroding or electronics overheating or desoldering — because that might happen while you're speeding down the highway or driving up the side of a mountain. You want independent and redundant pieces that can, if needed and as much as possible, operate with a modicum of functionality in the absence of part or all of the network.

And in my observation the smartest people tend to take a position of curiosity (and I think that's not an accident, since curiosity is how you become smart).\n\nWithout deep understanding of the problem, concluding that the experts are wrong and my intuition is right (to say nothing of telling them so) would probably be on the very bottom of the list of things to do— not the least because I've been on the other side, and I know how often non-experts have the right picture of my own field (and just how \"smart\" they look when they tell me I've got it all wrong "
