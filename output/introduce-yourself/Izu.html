Hi everyone! I’m Izu. I’m a developer and product designer, currently at Mailchimp, and have had an intense fascination with interfaces and the democratization of computing for as long as I can remember.<br/><br/>I fully believe that to expand access to the computer’s nature as an interactive medium, we have to provide tools beyond code that enable everyone to take part, just as Photoshop did for image editing or the typewriter did for text, and I’ve been working on a project with just that in mind. However, I’ve been in a silo on this and I’m just beginning to discover all of the incredible research and resources out there around visual programming and conveying interaction beyond code.<br/><br/>I can’t wait to hear more about the ideas for what’s next that y’all are working on. :pray:
