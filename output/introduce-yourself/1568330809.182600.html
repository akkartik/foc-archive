<b>Show FoC:</b> hi all! just found this group also via Steve's HN post. Excited this community exists! I also, wanted to share what we're working on - we're StoryForj, <a href="https://storyforj.com">https://storyforj.com</a> an interactive content creation tool for storytellers. Our tech is like Flash, without code, responsive, and state machine based. Anyways we're currently looking to partner up with content creators. If anyone knows of someone who might be interested in partnering send me a message. And to brighten up your day, here's a little story about Quokkas - <a href="https://storyforj.com/s/9X0J6Q">https://storyforj.com/s/9X0J6Q</a>

Hi Parris. I'm interested in learning more about StoryForj. I work on a team that's still doing a lot of Flash work (yeah, I know). I'm curious what the overlap between Flash and StoryForj is. Do you have tools for drawing artwork? Keyframe animation?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> ooo that is def surprising and interesting! No keyframe animations or ability to draw artwork unfortunately (yet). We do have some pre-canned animations, and we wouldn't be too far off from letting you build your own animations up from scratch.<br/><br/>As of right now our interactivity is mostly focused on showing/hiding things, and screen navigation. We allow for branching or linear (scrolling up/down or swiping left/right) screen navigation.<br/><br/>We may <b>not</b> be well suited if you often create characters and do a lot of animation in Flash. Buttttt you have inspired me. Would love to hear more about why your team still uses Flash. Honestly, I kinda miss the Flash days. There's still a level of interactivity we can't pull off right now with our current web tech.

We make these interactive simulations: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFvFNHWTy5U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFvFNHWTy5U</a><br/><br/>At this point we only use Flash (now Animate) to draw the artwork, because our artists prefer those drawing tools to Illustrator or Sketch. We export SVGs and add interactivity using some in-house JS frameworks and GUI tools.<br/><br/>I'm surprised that you use Flash as the point of comparison for StoryForj, not least of all because Flash has such a polarized reputation! I see your tool as making content more akin to digital articles rather than the games and animations Flash was known for. Is that just due to the initial focus, with plans to broaden the reach of your tool?

Yea right now we basically have capabilities to do really nice digital articles, and some small bits and pieces of interactivity. We plan on expanding that. Our 3 word vision is "apps for everyone". It's a big vision but that's where we want to go.<br/><br/>We're also unsure about drawing a parallel with Flash honestly. I guess I've been thinking lately that although Flash had a bad rep at the end, IMO it definitely had more of that apps for everyone mantra than where we're at today on the web. It ushered in a massive wave of amateur and professional coders making really rich applications.

A lot of the Flash bad reputation was nasty propaganda from Adobe hating companies, which included almost everyone. Adobe makes great stuff, but so many other companies feared it. Microsoft and Apple both did battle with Adobe's creativity tools, and often came up on the losing end. MS spent untold hundreds of millions building clones of Flash/Shockwave (their Silverlight), and tried to build publishing tools, etc., and Apple also had a fantasy that their Pages would somehow hold up against InDesign. MS and Apple teamed up to make TrueType to counter Adobe's Type 1 font format which they didn't want to pay for. Lots of rivalries between these companies, and lots of FUD (fear uncertainty and doubt) press releases sponsored by the negative-evangelical arms of those firms. Not many people  acknowledge the existence of those kinds of PR staffers, but they do exist.  I am personally sick of people pretending that everyone in the valley is playing sports like a proper english gentleman. There are tons of dirty tricks, and the bigger the company the dirtier they get IMHO. Who can forget Intel paying companies huge bonuses if they ship only 100% intel parts. that is so purely anticompetitive, they should have put intel CEO in jail.

And Saint Jobs had a whole layer of lawyer/VP's who do nothing but try and suppress bad stories, and take revenge on people who cross them. I never worked with Jobs, but i remember apple going to great lengths to try and find leverage on me for just a simple complaint.

The animation tools in Adobe Animate are beloved by animators. Very easy to use, and highly evolved after 20+ years. Animation tools take an incredibly long time to perfect. People use keyboard shortcuts, and need fast response.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@magicmouse94937</span> Totally agree. I still think we can't get anywhere close to where flash is using web tech today in terms of rich experiences.
