The guy at the top of this year's advent of code leader board (by some margin) is using a language he made himself (noulith), which is implemented in Rust (linked on the below page, which shows some of his solutions).  It even has a syntax highlighted CLI.  Next level for sure.  But interesting that he can 'optimize' his chances in so many varied puzzles by having his own language.  Of course, maybe he'd be just as fast in Python; but I wonder what there is to learn from his language design, if anything.<br/><a href="https://github.com/betaveros/advent-of-code-2022">https://github.com/betaveros/advent-of-code-2022</a>
