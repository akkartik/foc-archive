Hi everyone! My name is Robin Allison. I want to understand stuff. I studied pure math in undergrad and grad school for a year. I studied math because I could get it and obsessed over algebraic topology because more than any other subject because I couldn't get it. That wasn't good for my career but its given me a unique perspective on math and I'm grateful for that. I read Michael Nielsen's essay "Reinventing Explanation" which eventually let me understand Bret Victor. I came to the conclusion that my understanding was limited by the representations we used, and that by inventing my own I could better understand.<br/><br/>I've had two personal victories, one with spectral sequences and one with the proof of the cellular boundary, in designing better representations using static media. I'm working on better representing the computation of the homology of the projective plane using the decomposition RP^2 = e^2 \cup e^1 \cup e^0, extending the previous techniques. I hope that these "prototypes" can convince other mathematicians the merits and unexplored possibilities of design, leaving aside the possibilities of dynamic media. Additionally I speculate heavily on how we interface with mathematical ideas, motivated by whats probably considered low working memory and expressive language capabilities for math.<br/><br/>In my experience it is extremely difficult to get other mathematicians to think about the kinds of ideas talked about here. I think part of the problem is that the solution is outside of math whereas for coding at least the solution is still code and has a historical basis in the work of Alan Kay etc.  So I hope I can hang out here until mathematics expands to consider "design" a part of math too. :slightly_smiling_face:

Welcome! It sounds like you have some unique perspectives -- a "blue thought" in a "pink plane". I hope this group is able help you discover the "blue plane" you are looking for (and develop whatever tools or approach will make that plane visible). ... If I'm not making sense, I'll refer you to this recent post of mine:<br/><br/><a href="../thinking-together/1552755024.352300.html#1552797651.357800">../thinking-together/1.552797.html&hellip;</a><br/><br/>I (and surely others here) are hoping to do something similar with programming or computing.

Mathematicians by and large have not been much interested in computer programming as a field. For one, mathematics is at its core the study of pattern, and computer programming is very messy and patterns are hard to come by. Also, it doesn't lend itself to any proofs, because even a simple game like Snake can't be proven to be perfect, partly because there are subjective/aesthetic aspects to defining "correct" in a game. I myself am interested in measuring robustness in computer programs, especially as it relates to comparing two languages. Which language has the lowest propensity for error? Can one through the design of a language, make it much more difficult o create an error? I call it the Calculus of Error, and after using Modula-2 for example when everyone else was using C, i found that M2 programs were smaller, faster, and much more reliable, so there are intrinsic characteristics in a language which are measurable. In our industry we haven't been willing to tell the truth about the weaknesses in various languages, preferring to categorize things as mere preference. Without measurement you have fad and fashion.

Hi Robin, welcome to the group :wink:<br/>I'd be interested in your previous work, is it available online somewhere?<br/>My personal story with math is that I can only really understand most things once I've build a spacial mental model for them. I think about differentiation / integration in terms of diagrams, about gradient descend as arrows pointing downwards hills and so on. I believe that these representations are incredibly useful because they leverage our well-developed spacial imagination. In my opinion, there's a huge potential for good visualizations or even interactively explorable explanations to help people think about mathematical concepts. Like <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nick Smith</span> mentioned already, 3blue1brown's youtube channel is a very good example of this. Another good place to find cool explorable explanations is in this subreddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explorables/">https://www.reddit.com/r/explorables/</a><br/>Finally, I've created an interactive visualization of the Hough Transform myself some time ago: <a href="https://fkohlgrueber.github.io/blog/hough-transform/">https://fkohlgrueber.github.io/blog/hough-transform/</a><br/>While the visualization by itself doesn't teach the concept very well, I believe that tools like these could be really helpful to teachers trying to show more than a couple of static examples on slides.

hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Robin Allison</span>! my name's nagle. where are you based?<br/><br/>I studied pure math and algebraic topology as well in school! i think it's really relevant to the work here -- the visceral knack for what good thinking is and isn't it.<br/><br/>curious if you've come across alan citing the hadamard study that only 30% of mathematicians thinking symbolically and the other big way are kinaesthetic and in imagery? he quotes einstein talking about feeling the curves of space-time in his back.

Thanks for saying hi everyone!<br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Felix Kohlgrüber</span> I don't have my work documented online anywhere unfortunately. But I can try to give a quick summary here.<br/><br/>For the cellular boundary formula its not much. I'm essentially identifying a (conceptually) useful abstraction for this one proof and visually implementing that abstraction. That abstraction is grouping together a set of isomorphic objects for each natural number n and keeping track of the isomorphisms between them. The implementation consists of forming a new commutative diagram whose vertices/objects are now these systems of isomorphic objects and whose morphisms are now identified by specifying a particular morphism from one object of the domain system to an object of the codomain system. So now the commutative diagram reads: the map whose degree we want to take is the inclusion into the relative homology, followed by the boundary homomorphism followed by the projection onto the factor we want. This is roughly how we would understand the birds eye view of the original proof but neither this nor all the details are directly visible in the original.<br/><br/>For spectral sequences the representation is only a bit more substantial but the math is more difficult. For the spectral sequence of a filtered complex (of vector spaces) every vector space we will consider is uniquely isomorphic to a sub quotient of the original complex, that is, a quotient of a subspace. The relevant subspaces that we take and quotient by are linearly ordered so they can be placed on a line and then each sub quotient corresponds to a unique sub length of this line. For example if we have a filtered complex like 0=K_0 \subset K_1 \subset K_2 \subset K_3= <b>full complex</b> we can put K_0 on the line at 0, K_1 on the line at 1, K_2 on the line at 2 and K_3 at the line at three (and just have the line go from 0 to 3). Then the sub quotient K_2/K_1 would correspond to the length of line going from 1 to 2 and H_<b>(K_2/K_1), being a sub quotient of K_2/K_1, would be signified by a smaller length line, say from 1.2 to 1.7, for a concrete mental image (although there really isn't any basis for those or any specific numbers aside from being between 1 and 2). Also in practice I would use the span from 1 to 2 for H_</b>(K_2/K_1) because I would rarely consider K_2/K_1 in and of itself. This is essentially what is depicted in the first picture although we are looking at H_* of a subquotient further down, namely E_{p,q}^{r-1}. Most of the sub quotients we consider are triply indexed so its a daunting task to follow the logic for the proofs of the main theorems in a single presentation let alone get a birds eye view of it all. Its the common canvas that every development of spectral sequences paints over so I can naturally compare and contrast different approaches; I can see every development occurring simultaneously/in the same visual space. Its a really cool thing! In the second picture we see two more of the same “canvases” where the small horizontal lines indicate the subquotients we are looking at and the arrows are the morphisms in the long exact sequences relating each of the subquotients.<br/><br/>As I'm working to extend these techniques to representing the computation of the homology of RP^2 I'm more inspired by Bret's BART Widget than any one thing in Kill Math, since Kill Math is mostly about quantitative stuff and the widget is about this complicated highly relational thing.  (OK, I need to figure out how to include pictures).

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@nagle</span> nagle! I'm just out of grad school so I'm living at home for now.<br/><br/>I've heard of that study before but I've never looked at it. Its just people personally reporting how they think right? Its definitely not an either-or thing for me and I'd have a hard time even saying if I favor one way of thinking over another. It depends so much on the subject and how familiar I am with the material. I think most people are guided by the visual/kinesthetic channels for thinking but need the symbolic channels for doing rigorous math. Math is at its best imo when the symbolic and visual forms are in harmony - when the visual forms guide symbolic thinking and the symbolic forms clarify our mental images. Some parts of math are visually impoverished so to make the most out of the little visualization there is, we have to pay closer attention to the symbolic forms.<br/><br/>I guess thats really where my thinking is at, the parts of math that are nearly impenetrable to visual understanding, and how can you make the best of that situation. I believe things can be vastly improved here but I probably shouldn't begin that rant now.
