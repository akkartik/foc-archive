Hello all! I’ve been hanging around this community since I attended the first London meetup, so it’s probably about time I introduced myself. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>I’m an Australian software developer currently working as a contractor in London and looking forward to working in other global cities in the future. Was fortunate enough to discover computers around age 12, got my first paid development job at 15 (couldn’t believe that I could get paid to do something I already enjoy!) and never looked back. Worked with various languages, projects and stacks. These days it’s Typescript, Javascript, Rx and C#. Maybe (hopefully!) Scala in the near future.<br/><br/>My formal education is a bit scant, but I’ve reading up and doing courses here and there. Some books I really enjoyed were ‘A Philosophy of Software Design’ (Outsterhout), ‘Code Complete’ (McConnel) and ‘Design Patterns’ (GOF). And this community has also been a fount of resources.<br/><br/>I constantly feel like a beginner with software, and maybe it’ll be that way for life, but I still want to advance my knowledge.<br/><br/>I’m especially interested in the craft of coding, the construction of software and systems and the intersection of design and programming. My biggest weakness is fear &amp; ignorance of math, but I’m slowly chipping away at that.<br/><br/>I’m very fond of certain kinds of music that have a systematic and/or cyclic element to them. I especially love the symphonies of Anton Bruckner, which seem to have an organic complexity and depth that I get totally lost in.<br/><br/>Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> &amp; <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> and all of you. Let’s get it started in here! B-)

There aren't a lot of great books on programming, but i can recommend Programs = Algorithms + Data Structures by Prof. Wirth of ETH. He invented Pascal, Modula-2, Oberon, the Lilith computer. His Modula-2 language was the high-water mark in the 70's for languages, and aspects of it have not been matched yet in any other language i am aware of. I would burn "Code Complete". Any company that has over a million outstanding unresolved bugs in their OS has no business writing a book on how to program properly. By any objective measurement, MS is one of the most inefficient companies in the history of computers. The previous most inefficient company was IBM, and indeed MS is better than they were, but seriously their systems are like swiss cheese.  Wirth's books are short, economical, beautiful work.

If you like Bruckner, you would probably like Aarvo Paart.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@magicmouse94937</span> Interesting you mention Aarvo Paart. Yes, certainly I’ve heard about how meditative and mystical his work is. I have been searching for this kind of “transcendent” experience and finding it in a diverse range of others including Somei Satoh, Toru Takemitsu, Lilli Boulanger, John Luther Adams, Gyorgi Ligeti and sometimes with the “night music” aspect of Bella Bartok. I haven’t quite gotten into Aarvo Paart yet, but now that you bring him up, I think I’ll give him another listen this week and try to have an open mind. Thanks for mentioning.

The Requiem by Maurice Durflé is a killer work. He takes you straight to heaven. If you are interested in mystic music, you might look at Scriabin's piano works. He was working on a super-work called the Mysterium that would cause spontaneous enlightenment. He was a very interesting fellow. Also post-awakening John Coltrane is wonderful stuff. Myself for programming i used Anoushka Shankar to power the first year of my project. She's better than her father was, and he was great. Rhythmic music helps with typing.

How on earth did I forget to include Scriabin among my list of fascinating composers?! (Latter Scriabin of course, e.g. the two Symponies/Poems and as you mentioned, the piano works). Mysterium - wasn’t that a work to be performed on a mountain in India during the end of the world? Got to get into this stuff more! Too much careerism can sap one’s spirituality. :slightly_smiling_face:

Never quite got into John Coltrane, but Sun Ra and Parliament Funkadelic interested me a lot with themes of space and transcendence (I experience “Maggot Brain” as simply pure meditation). Will check out Maurice Durfle.

Coltrane ranges from super mellow to unbearable atonality/harshness. The album he did with Johnny Hartman is one of the most mellow records you will ever hear. There is also a compilation called the "gentle side of JC" that is particularly pleasant. His wife Alice Coltrane was no slouch either, and she made a lot of spacey harp music at the same time as he was doing his stuff. Coltrane got into heroin and then kicked it so there an intensity in his work, depending on his physical state, that is quite extreme. And of course you are getting McCoy Tyner who is super great. Tyner still performs a bit, he is one of the only survivors of that era. sorry i misspelled Durufle earlier. He wrote very little music, but his Requiem i believe is even nicer than Faure's. And also worth checking out is Cannonball Adderly &amp; Nancy Wilson. She was just a kid at the time, her first record, and it is spectacular. Youth is so beautiful.
