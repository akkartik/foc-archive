It's been a slow month because of my RSI, but I need closure on a couple of features I've been slowly building out: <a href="https://archive.org/details/akkartik-2min-2020-09-02">https://archive.org/details/akkartik-2min-2020-09-02</a><br/><br/>I need closure because I've gotten excited recently about dropping my dependency on the Linux kernel, and a way to provide graphics without an OS.<br/><br/>Using BIOS.<br/><br/><em>waves hands.</em> No, wait, come back. Check this out: <a href="http://arclanguage.org/item?id=21532">http://arclanguage.org/item?id=21532</a>. While using *VGA primitives is never going to give a large screen resolution or 60fps games, I think it might give us some nice new capabilities for very little code.<br/><br/>I'm starting to think of the BIOS as "a standard instruction set for all the other hardware besides the processor." That seems fruitful. (<a href="../linking-together/1597899212.000500.html">../linking-together/1597899212.000500.html</a>)<br/><br/>The real problem down this road is input. A keyboard will be fine. A mouse seems iffy but hopefully doable. But pressure-sensitive multi-touch, fuggedaboudit. So no minority-report-style FoC demos in Mu's future. Oh well. I'm not even sure what a reasonable API for multi-touch looks like, so I'm not going to worry about it for now.

I <em>love</em> that this community has someone delving so far down into the mantle, so to speak. I find this project fascinating and entirely foreign in equal measure. I have so much to learn.

Unfortunately this particular tangent didn't pan out. A week later I realized that a lot of BIOS only works in 16-bit mode. And I'm not willing to give up 32-bit mode. There's other hobbyist computers out there that do 8-bit and 16-bit, and part of the hypothesis of Mu is that we're still carrying the baggage of extreme optimization-focus in our computing stacks, and that our computers might be more comprehensible if computers in the 80s had more RAM. Dropping down to 16-bit would give up easy access to most RAM and nudge me like many others along a path of trying to squeeze code into fewer bytes. So -- particularly for network drivers -- it seems there's no way around some sort of OS with device drivers. So I'm kinda bummed out about this trail for now. The computing industry is busted in ways I'm not really empowered to fix. Perhaps I'll pick it up again in a few months and try to come up with some lowest-common-denominator set of hardware standards that all devices support. *VGA for screen, PS/2 for keyboard/mouse, there's something called the "em driver" for ethernet that's supposed to be widely supported, but I need to dig into it.

&gt; that our computers might be more comprehensible if computers in the 80s had more RAM<br/>This is something I've wondered about a lot. But mostly from the other side â€” what might future programmers (and, usually when I think this, I'm picturing <em>games</em> programmers specifically) discard of our current best efforts, since their better hardware affords them a purer conception that we couldn't access (or sell).<br/><br/>&gt; The computing industry is busted in ways I'm not really empowered to fix<br/>I don't even have the words. Also: capitalism.<br/><br/>&gt; Perhaps I'll pick it up again in a few months and try to come up with some lowest-common-denominator set of hardware standards that all devices support.<br/>Are you out of your mind?! In fact.. forget that. Godspeed.
