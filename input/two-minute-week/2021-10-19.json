It's now possible to drag directly connected nodes by dragging a connection\/wire. Offcourse it's in preparation to be able to have special controls to drag all connected nodes or nodes that are connected upstream or downstream. yeah , I was inspired by <@UC2A2ARPT> \"rant\" on a lot of vpl's (mine included), although I thought it was just very inspirational offcourse and will work on improving my editor hopefully on time for our review session somewhere on November. For now I just have a lot of work todo, and having limited time, that's quite a challenge.\nAnother feature that I already implemented some time ago is the \"mini-excel\"-datagrid which can have expressions and even in attached expression-nodes you can run expressions on the cells.\nI am also working on removing a node from the canvas and leaving the connected arrows on the canvas, but that needs some more work.\n<https:\/\/youtu.be\/OuOxV5xJxgY>",
