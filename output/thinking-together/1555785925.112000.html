I agree. However, I still believe we are in a crisis of great proportions (I call it software environmentalism crisis): we are creating software at a much higher pace than we are able to recycle. We are essentially drowning in software we are not able to move anymore. So, if we are to create a sustainable future, it must be one in which an old system is kept around because of its value and fitness not because of the impossibility to remove. I believe this is essential.
