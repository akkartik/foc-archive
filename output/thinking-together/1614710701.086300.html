&gt; If I make an app, I have control and the user can only do what I decide is possible. If I make a document, the user can do as they please, changing it to their own needs<br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Xavier Lambein</span> posted this <a href="../linking-together/1614709272.084400.html#1614710311.085000">here</a>. I think that's a really interesting distinction that highlights a tension in software development. Sometimes as a developer <em>or</em> as a user I want there to be guardrails. Does anybody have thoughts about whether there's a middleground between documents and apps? Can you have the best of both worlds?<br/><br/>I'm picturing a system where it's fundamentally, or foundationally a document, but the user has opted in to a set of restrictions that make it into an app. Sort of like Enable/Disable js for the web , but more granular and a richer ontology.

Notion and Coda are good examples of that

Types and schemas are guardrails. One of the use cases I think about is letting a TODO text file scale smoothly into an issue/work tracking system. Somewhere along the way, it's a list or set where all the entries/lines have to be a certain format. Then for modifying the list, you slowly graduate from direct manipulation to defined mutation operations. The entries themselves can graduate to records whenever you feel like it.<br/><br/>Further down the stack, strict types (especially e.g. session types) and frameworks can enforce strict usage patterns on their users, more like your "apps", whereas less strict libraries are closer to your "documents".

If document means something other than "popular and simple <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">MIME type</a>", then document vs app loses distinction in my eyes

There's a fundamental tension in how much power you give to the immediate user as compared to future users.<br/><br/>The document distinction is not universal. One of the reasons PDF is popular is because most people don't have PDF editors installed, so the format suggests a sense of finality and care that .docx doesn't provide. If PDF editors were common, and .docx viewers were common, the formats would probably reverse in how they are used in society.<br/><br/>A similar thing exists in programming for stuff like marking classes as <b>final</b> in Java. This feature is just a straight political decision to favour the initial class writer over future users.

PDFs are also an excellent example in how much interactivity they support. Besides my friend making self-filling mad-libs in PDF, when I worked in government almost the entire process of applying for/modifying a transit subsidy was managed through a single PDF. It would walk you through several screens of forms and then (IIRC) offer to email itself to the relevant office. I was and remain equal parts amazed and horrified.

the way i read the document/app distinction is basically an app lets you do something whereas a document is something you get at the end of using some tool (that you can keep, or edit later)
