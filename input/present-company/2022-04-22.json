Stuff is still happening, they have real people testing DL and are doing what they can to keep working on it despite the pandemic. If they have something to share that'll change the world, they'll share that publicly. If they don't have something of that nature yet, they'll keep working toward that goal. I personally wouldn't want it any other way."
