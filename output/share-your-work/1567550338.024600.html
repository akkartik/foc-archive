Prof. Wirth's Lilith computer is another miracle of economy, and was sold for a few years. It used Oberon and was inspired by his time spent at Xerox PARC. Oberon is a very clever language; i used its predecessor Modula-2 for 20 years to great success. Wirth made a deadly mistake when he removed enumerated types from Oberon 1 which prevented large code bases written in Modula-2 to cross over. Oberon 2 fixed it, but the damage was already done.
