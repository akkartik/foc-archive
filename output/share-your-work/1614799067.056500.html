If you think Tree Notation is a promising idea or you think I should see a doctor and get my head checked, supporting me for $1 per month here <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/breck7">https://github.com/sponsors/breck7</a> would help in both situations! You don't even have to tell me which it is. I hate to bring up a commerical ask in this forum, but maybe we could have a channel like #SupportEachOther or something for asks like this

I am 100% okay with asks like this, here in this channel, to support work that has been evolving in dialog with the community. We're here for this.
