I started researching into the history of Lambda Calculus (which sort of is the foundation for a lot of FP stuff) and as my understanding sharpened I found out that there is a lot of concurrency, link backs, reinterpretation etc. that happens in that space. But to narrate this (hi)story as one goddamn thing after another, it becomes important to partition the graph to a linear list (or tree\/lattice). That is what I am trying to capture with this series.\n\nThese are all great materials: <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/C5T9GPWFL\/p1606080246079200?thread_ts=1606079753.078900&amp;channel=C5T9GPWFL&amp;message_ts=1606080246.079200>\n\nIf you love Hofstadter’s work I highly recommend you look into Louis Kauffman’s video.

I started researching into the history of Lambda Calculus (which sort of is the foundation for a lot of FP stuff) and as my understanding sharpened I found out that there is a lot of concurrency, link backs, reinterpretation etc. that happens in that space. But to narrate this (hi)story as one goddamn thing after another, it becomes important to partition the graph to a linear list (or tree\/lattice). That is what I am trying to capture with this series.\n\nThese are all great materials: "
