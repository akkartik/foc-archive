Hi everyone :wave: My name is Helder and I'm an independent HCI researcher from Brazil. One of the two main areas I focus on is discrete input optimization (keyboard-first interaction and optimized text-entry for assistive devices, VR, and things with few buttons/actuators). The other area of focus is end-user programming, which grew from the first.<br/><br/>My main personal project is called Keykapp, a "visual interactive predictive concatenative programming" interface I'll spare you from rambling on too much about right now, except to say that it's a bit like command palettes and smartphone virtual keyboards had a weirdo Turing-complete baby :)<br/><br/>I've seen some really cool visual concatenative programming things on the archives, and I'd love to talk more with anyone who's interested, and also learn more about what everyone is working on. Thanks!
