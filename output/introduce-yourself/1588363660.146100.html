Hello, I'm Thomas. I'm a former book seller/video game journalist (and fighting game nerd) turned UI and Accessibility developper. I don't have anything noteworthy to share about the future of coding, I'm mostly helping friends getting their own websites for personal and fun projects to fight centralization. I like the podcast and as a former art student, I'm very interesting in visuals and code related stuff. For a few months now I have started seeing code not only as a production tool but as a self discovery tool. I'm starting to build my own tools to fit my needs, asking myself actually how do I like doing things, instead of doing things with other people's way of doing.<br/><br/>I'll probably lurk on what you post and discuss to educate myself. Thanks for having me!
