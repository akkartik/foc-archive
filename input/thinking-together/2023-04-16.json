        "text": "*Befunge, but readable*\n\n<https:\/\/github.com\/m-ender\/hexagony> made the rounds of the internet yesterday, and caused me to swap in an old interest of mine that I've flailed ineffectually at in the past (e.g. <https:\/\/twitter.com\/akkartik\/status\/1238349948074070017>): a way to display a program that makes its large-scale structure really obvious (rather than obfuscating it as Befunge does).\n\nOne problem I have with Befunge (not the one you're thinking of, ha) and other _fungeoids_ [1] is that you have a bunch of static information about a program visible in 2D on screen, but a key piece -- the stack -- is invisible. The question I keep returning to is how one might go about making the stack (or any other run-time state used by the program) visible without just bolting it on on the side. This time around, I got hooked on the following metaphor. Imagine a spaceship that contains some data, sets out on a voyage across an infinite 2D plane, and performs various operations depending on the objects it collides with.\n\nExample 1: The space ship contains a row of boxes. Colliding with a number pushes a box on to the nose,  colliding with an operator operates on the 1 or 2 front-most boxes in the front. This is a way to display a stack, but a stack in isolation doesn't seem to scale well to larger programs.\n\nExample 2: The spaceship contains a number. Colliding with the BF-inspired primitives `+` and `-` [2] causes the number to be incremented and decremented, respectively. Now build addition out of it. Zooming into a number `n` shows it to be a loop of n iterations. When the spaceship collides with `n` it loops through n times, and the number inside it has n added to it. At a high zoom, you see the spaceship loop n times before exiting the \"solar system\". At a low zoom you see the spaceship exit instantaneously with n added to its value. Now you can imagine a reduce operation as a series of solar systems that the spaceship visits one by one.\n\nExample 3: The spaceship contains a binary heap to insert and delete elements from depending on objects it collides with. Zooming into any single collision reveals the tree structure to be the \"space\" that a smaller spaceship containing a single number bounces among.\n\nTwo properties that seem important from these examples:\n• A hierarchical nature where space and spaceship are duals, and zooming in and out causes them to turn into each other.\n• Rendering the state of a spaceship needs to be extensible[3]. We need to leave Befunge's ASCII behind.\nAt the largest scale, state machines feel like a really powerful way to represent the state within a spaceship. I often find them to be the outermost architecture of a large program. But to _actually find_ the state machine I have to flail around for a long time. If we could use some visual paradigm at the largest scales but zoom into text as needed, programs might be much more comprehensible.\n\n[1] <https:\/\/esolangs.org\/wiki\/Fungeoid>\n[2] <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brainfuck#Language_design>\n[3] Like in my old Pong demo: <https:\/\/handmade.network\/snippet\/1561>",

Zooming into any single collision reveals the tree structure to be the \"space\" that a smaller spaceship containing a single number bounces among.\n\nTwo properties that seem important from these examples:\n"
