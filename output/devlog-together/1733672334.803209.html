so i started toying with something a bit weird and i'm honestly not sure what i think so far:<br/><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ezhik.me/post/3lcshj5bmik2u">https://bsky.app/profile/ezhik.me/post/3lcshj5bmik2u</a><br/><br/>like i notice people doing <b>wild</b> stuff with their obsidians and notions - basically creating entire personalized apps and databases and i think it's cool as hell - like it just show how much people want to code for themselves, it's 100% end-user programming.<br/><br/>and now i wanted to solve a small problem for myself and accidentally made a type system for obsidian and i kinda wonder what else could be done with it? like what if each note was a bit like a val.town val and could contain some code? what if this "class" system could be extended to, for example, allow providing data fields? then this could be some sort of a strange database, perhaps more like the pre-rdbms hierarchical database systems?<br/><br/>what if 'end-user programming' as a concept could be something that grows out of people's own digital gardens, rather than from making "simpler" versions of professional tools?
