(deep breath) herewith my very-informal-first-draft intro / manifesto for zero, the programming language I'm working on. If any of this resonates either positively or negatively, I would love to know more ! In particular, I welcome challenges to any ideas expressed here, to see if they can stand up (or if I can make them stand up). If there's interest, I'll post a demo video of where I am with the implementation.

Definitely interesting. I like thinking about the idea maze in the neighborhood of what you call features. Stuff like AOP[1], FOP[2], Literate programming. You choose to make features run-time entities and therefore immutable, and as a result the namespace of features will get polluted over time. The way I program I mostly care about decomposing programs for comprehension rather than deployment, and so I allow features to be modified: <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers">http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers</a>. Is this deploy-time flexibility intended to support your live-coding use case?<br/><br/>[1] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming</a><br/>[2] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature-oriented_programming">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature-oriented_programming</a>

Some smaller comments on other features (pun intended).<br/><br/><li> Returning immediately when the named result is assigned to is an interesting idea I've never considered before. Do you plan to support multiple named results? I'd played with this idea in my project[1] which is a <em>lot</em> more imperative/low-level/parsimonious. But I eventually reverted to a more conventional <tt>return</tt> keyword just so I could easily detect code paths that failed to return all results. I'm curious if you consider multiple results to be too difficult in a pure functional context.<br/><br/><li> I like the free syntax for declaring functions. It'll be interesting to see how you go about parsing function calls. Inform 7[2] may have some insights, if you aren't already aware of it.<br/><br/><li> The combination of array polymorphism with your other features is most interesting. Particularly live coding support. I'm not an expert on APL and its descendants, all the way down to Gilad Bracha's <em>ShapeRank</em>[3].<br/><br/>[1] <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">https://github.com/akkartik/mu</a><br/>[2] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inform">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inform</a><br/>[3] <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/details/splash-2020-rebase/26/A-Ray-of-Hope-Array-Programming-for-the-21st-Century">https://2020.splashcon.org/details/splash-2020-rebase/26/A-R&hellip;</a>

Hot takes...<br/>Feature Modularity — With isolation, sounds great.<br/>First-class Representation of Time-Domain Behaviour — Got me reading.<br/>Omniscient Debugging — Love it.<br/><br/>(Note that the goal of generating a trace from every running program runs counter to the goals of performance and responsiveness. We did not say any of this would be easy, merely that we believe it to be possible.) — Debugging and running are usually different activities; moreover, the surface being debugged is usually a lot smaller than all that's running.  And with somewhat pure semantics, you can generate traces lazily.  It's all hard, but not impossible.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> 1) yes, multiple result values should be easy enough to do, just put them in brackets; I'm also considering 'partial assignment', eg. if I have a structure, I can just set one or more of its members, leaving the rest unchanged; this would mean something like "return x unchanged, except for property p, which should be set to y"

2) the parser for free-syntax is definitely a bit gnarly; I just went ahead and wrote it brute-force. It's super dumb and slow, but since it only has to run on a very small amount of code (the feature you're writing) it doesn't matter. Or at least that's what I'm hoping :wink:

3) the array stuff is informed by APL/R/S, as well as some experience with machine-learning (numpy, pytorch). So far I've only really considered 1-D arrays, but it should be generalisable. I'm considering restricting it to only 1- 2- and 3-D tensors, forcing everything else to be packaged in structs so semantic information doesn't get lost. Fundamentally, any hierarachy of structures containing only numbers should be convertable to and from an N-D tensor. Really need to pick a problem to throw at it and see what comes out.

4) features - I'd read some stuff on AOP and FOP, but most of what I've read was about adding AOP/FOP on top of an OOP layer, which I consider not really solving the basic problem of exploding complexity. zero's approach is to just chuck out OOP as a bad idea (sorry Bjarne !), and come at the problem afresh - it's like "C with features" instead of "C with objects and features".

The reason to make features immutable is the huge benefit you get in reasoning about changes to things, particularly the data model (you express changes to data structures, which gives you automatic backwards and cross-compability), and compilation (you already have ASTs and code for 99% of the application, so why rebuild it all to change one line of code ?). However there are parts of features (such as names, or function-structure) that can be changed without changing their semantics - there was a cool language project I saw which stored everything as structural hashes, rather than text names - so for example, one could modify an existing feature to add an intervention point to override, without breaking it.

Being able to switch features on and off in a very fluid way at runtime is core to the appeal of the concept - when the program does something that displeases the user, they should be able to say "why did you do X ?" and receive answer saying "feature F made me do it" and respond with "well, turn feature F off then, and try again", or "let's modify feature F with an exception for this case, and try again".

Also, yeah, this all aims at the idea that every program in the wild is potentially modifiable by the user, which means some kind of reconstructable trace is required even for release versions. So whenever a user is displeased with the running of their program, they can replicate the run precisely later on, and either they or another coder can pinpoint the issue and the fix (which becomes a new feature). The idea of "a program that does not allow this" is rejected by the design goals.

By "isolation," I mean "specify precisely what context the feature applies in."  So I want the feature active here, but not there.  Contrast open classes where adding a feature to them makes the feature visible everywhere or say Ruby refinements <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.4.0/syntax/refinements_rdoc.html">https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.4.0/syntax/refinements_rdoc.html</a> whose semantics is sufficiently weird that I don't think anyone ever uses them.  (False!  In my 433 gems that I happen to have handy, 126 matches across 103 files.)

Gotcha. Yes, I have a plan (though not specified / implemented yet) to be able to specify precisely where a modifier (on/after/before/replace) applies, using an 'in' construct; i.e. something like<br/>in var1 &lt;&lt; task1(param1, ...)<br/>    in var2 &lt;&lt; task2(param2, ...)<br/>       after var3 &lt;&lt; task3(param3, ...)<br/>           &lt;modification&gt;

The right formulation should also allow subsequent features to modify that decision (make it more / less general depending on other conditions) so the above isn't the final form, but that's sort of the idea.

I've had this idea that modules (not mere types) should be optionally parameterized, like, you could say "this module uses 'strings' and two kinds of 'number' which by default are UTF-8 strings, 32-bit fixed-point and 64-bit float, but the user of this module can override the default with their own choices". I wonder if Abstract Types are like that.

When you say "when we run main(), we get a friendly little beep at the same time" do you literally mean that <tt>out$ &lt;&lt; "hello world !"</tt> and <tt>audio$ &lt;&lt; sample("beep.wav")</tt> run concurrently?

What is the meaning of all those dollar signs?<br/><br/>"results are named, and assignment of the result terminates the function" it sounds like you're breaking tradition in a confusing unhelpful way. There is an established tradition called <tt>return</tt> for terminating a function, whereas assigning to named results (a la Visual Basic) should not terminate the function. Personally I would like both mechanisms to be available.<br/><br/>That one can define an "inner" function that isn't inner (is directly accessible outside the outer function - are you saying that it is accessible <em>unqualified</em>?) - this doesn't seem like a bad feature to me per se, but this behavior should be something the programmer asks for, not implicit.<br/><br/>Ordinary functions cannot accept arrays? How is this not a crippling restriction? Is this a limitation of GPUs (I haven't programmed any before)? If so how do GPU programmers work around it? I can't imagine how to write a compiler that processes arbitrary syntax/semantic trees on a GPU. Do you know how to write the zero language in itself?<br/><br/>"a task is a pair of values; one is being read from (the 'current' value) and the other is being written to" Why isn't it a queue, or an LMAX disruptor or something?<br/><br/>Have you studied Halide for inspiration?

"baggage" : yes, the idea is that effectively the version control history of the software and the software are one and the same, i.e. a program is a gigantic sphere composed entirely of sticky plasters. I honestly don't know if this scheme is workable at all for real projects - that's kind of why I'm building it, to find out. My thoughts are that it can be made to work, because : 1) usually when I want to modify a program, I'll be able to narrow my focus down to the feature that causes the behaviour I want to change, and its ancestors/descendants, leaving all other code out of consideration; in my metaphor above, that means zeroing in on the one sticky plaster that matters, understanding how it works, and adding another sticky plaster 2) I can imagine optimisations where we detect 'dead code' (that can no longer run) and get rid of it / archive it / something like that; 3) something clever that we'll invent when we run into the need for it ?

Abstract types are my response to a historical event in our own code base, when we moved from 32-bit to 64-bit. I realised there were lots of uses of "int" where the author genuinely did not care how many bits were used ("just use enough bits !"), but lots of other cases where they did genuinely care, because reasons. So I wanted to be able to distinguish between these - therefore in zero when I say "i32" I mean "signed integer with 32 bits" but when I say "int" I mean "integer" which means "signed or unsigned, and I don't care how many bits you use, <b>figure it out</b>"

They're also a throwback to my compsci dissertation which was on something called Order Sorted Algebras, which proposed a different meaning for "subtyping"; saying "A is a subtype of B" means "every A is a B, but not every B is an A", i.e. "Square is a subtype of Rect", even though Square has one property and Rect has two.

So I can write a bunch of code using the 'number' abstract type, and if it gets compiled for a TPU that's great at 16-bit floats, it will use those, but if it gets compiled for an FPGA that can only do 8-bit integers, it will use those instead. That's the general idea.

"when we run main(), we get a friendly little beep at the same time" : yes, the two tasks run concurrently. There's a bunch of work to do on how to manage conflicts between features that don't know about each other (eg. what if two separate tasks both play audio or write text at the same time - how do we resolve that ?) but I'm assuming they can be resolved

"What is the meaning of all those dollar signs?" Actually those are borrowed from the first language I ever programmed in, BBC BASIC - they're pronounced "string", so i$ would be "i-string". I hit on that as the character to use because it felt like the right thing, but I'm not especially wedded to that specific character. "int i$" means "a task that generates a stream of int over multiple frames" ('frames' =&gt; clock ticks or whatever - that's not fully elucidated in the document yet). For the moment you can think of them as generators. I'm also not crazy about the "&lt;&lt;" but I've yet to think of something better. Open to suggestions.

""results are named, and assignment of the result terminates the function" it sounds like you're breaking tradition in a confusing unhelpful way" - I did agonise over this for a while. It's actually a response to the huge mess in C++ over their recent move semantics - I wanted to break from the idea that there is an implicit stack and we're copying things around, and make it feel more like "writing results to a variable that already exists", the way we do in assembly language, or "term rewriting", where the intent is more like "when you see this pattern, replace it with this pattern". Also, in most C++ code I write, I invariably end up declaring a named variable eg "result" and then going "return result" at the end. So this just makes that cleaner. I also like that it lets me use very similar notation for functions and tasks, with just the operator (= or &lt;&lt;) changing.  I definitely take your point that it is different, but for the moment I'm giving myself permission to break tradition wherever it feels right !

"inner" function that isn't inner - yeah, I think you're right there; or maybe the other way round, that they're outer by default, but you can make them inner somehow. Where this comes from is that I noticed that when I'm writing C++ code in a straight line, I invariably end up with blocks of code that look like<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">// now I'm going to do something with (x)<br/>statement1(x);<br/>statement2(x);<br/>statement3(x);</pre><br/>and then later on I think "wow, I should really make that into a function", but I'm too busy and lazy and whatever, and it's a pain in the arse, so I don't do it. Or, worse, I do it, and now the code (statement1-3) is somewhere else, and to understand what's happening I have to jump to another bit of code, and it's just ... klunky. Hence the idea of combined call-and-define; instead of the above, I just do<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">doSomething(x)<br/>    statement1(x)<br/>    statement2(x)<br/>    statement3(x)</pre><br/>It's <b>definitely</b> a weird / quirky / controversial thing to do, but actually once you start writing code like that, it feels natural - you're not breaking flow all the time to create functions, you just create them and use them in the same breath.

"Ordinary functions cannot accept arrays? How is this not a crippling restriction?" - yes, definitely, this one is an eyebrow-raiser. Functions are defined as "operations on values of rank 0 only".<br/>The motivation is that (combined with array variable names having to end with square brackets) it gives us a very clean syntax for map and reduce operations; so I can look at<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">c = a + b</pre><br/>and know immediately that this is a singular operation, because c, a and b are singular values; I don't have to go back and see where they were declared to figure out what their array-rank is (which is a constant source of confusion for me in numpy, C++, etc). Conversely, when I see<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">c[] = a[] + b[]</pre><br/>I know immediately that it's a mapping operation, because I know "+" only takes singular values.<br/>The reason this isn't crippling is that structure properties can be arrays, so I can "smuggle" an array into a function by wrapping it in a structure; but crucially, this manoeuvre forces me to specify semantics. So, for instance, if I have an array of vertices and I want to perform some operation on them, I have to wrap them into another structure (eg. Mesh) and now they are properly typed, so I know what's going on.<br/>What's not good about this (apart from it being super weird compared to all existing languages, which as you may have guessed by now isn't my major concern :wink:) is that I'm still unsure how to specify actual array-modifying operations like concatenation, slicing, and so on. I've got a few ideas, of course.

"a task is a pair of values; one is being read from (the 'current' value) and the other is being written to" - sure, it could be a queue, and probably will end up going that way. This came from the graphics thing of "front buffer and back buffer", the idea that one value is being read while the other is being written, and they swap over at a specific and precise time, even if the computation of the new value is slow, or happens earlier, or both. In fact, under the hood, most of the time we can optimise that away, if there are no concurrent reads happening; and then for things like lexers we can imagine wanting to look forward or backwards in time, so yeah, a queue or another structure under the hood is a great idea. I just haven't got to that part yet !
