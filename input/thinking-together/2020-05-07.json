But when a codebase is used to craft scholarly publications that are in turn used to influence public policy, the authors of those publications (and ultimately policy) need to ensure that the science is verifiable in a public sense. The lack of tests makes that an impossibility. So closure of this Issue, by retraction of studies based on it, is meant as a critique of the publication and policy authors, not the contributors to this repo.\n\n(Note: In addition to the :+1: emoji, it's probably sensible to \"sign\" as a comment with your username, as it becomes impossible to see the emoji-ers above a certain threshold).",

Nobody here is laughing about that. The report was also very frank about the uncertainty involved in trying to predict what might happen at that stage",

At the lowest level we have electricity flying over connected wires and various interconnected micro devices _which are compatible_ because they use the same voltage, etc. Just because we can connect two micro devices doesn't mean it will do any useful. Once we implement 'bytes' it becomes totally irrelevant what voltage and shape of wires is used to represent 'bytes as ram'. So you can switch out the voltage and entire circuitry with something very different and as long as you can simulate 'bytes', its still all good - because your program is dealing with 'bytes' and not 'voltage'.

What do bytes transmit? data structures which represent _information_. So for composition between two entities, they must agree, at least partly, on the _shape of the information._ If this is possible, they could negotiate and converge on one of many possible byte representations (or perhaps forgo bytes altogether in some other future computer).
