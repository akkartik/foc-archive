Hi! my name is Hernán Wilkinson, from Argentina, Smalltalker :slightly_smiling_face: , professor at the FCEyN-UBA, partner at 10Pines and FAST (Argentinean Foundation of Smalltalk).<br/>I’ve implemented LiveTyping for Cuis Smalltalk. LiveTyping collects types while the system is running (in Smalltalk that is all the time, even when programming) and retro-feed that info into de development environment to improve tools such as refactorings, autocomplete, etc. LiveTyping allows you to use development tools as if you were using a statically typed language but in a dynamically typed one, without the burden to define and maintain the types.<br/>I’ve also implemented many refactorings for Cuis Smalltalk and created a distribution called CuisUniversity to teach OO at the university, besides other things.
