As a result of that fact, the user can alter the data arbitrarily, and there is no possibility that by doing so they cause queries to become non-terminating. That's the actual upside. The user can't break it. If you are using a higher-order system, you have to either a) be careful not to use potentially infinite structures in your queries (in which case why not just use FPL), or b) guard against the user adding data that causes infinite loops. For my use case, b) was already taken care of in the context of the limited queries I have. Thanks for the enlightening chat!",
