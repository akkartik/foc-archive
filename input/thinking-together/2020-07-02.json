It’s great because the lessons are bite sized, spaced repeated so I’m not stressed about remembering, requires you to write code and be active etc. Any one tried other approaches that worked really well? How would this be different in 10 years? Or what would a vision of the future look like?",

        "text": "I don't know there is an easy answer. Coming from the perspective of games would I rather have 1000 systems from which I must choose 50-150 and then manually \"mix them\" (probably man years of work to really understand all the ins and outs of each system). Or do I just want Unreal\/Unity which already made the choices and I can start immediately on the core of the experience I'm trying to provide instead of man years of engineering prep first. I'm not saying one is good and one is bad. Only that reasonable people can choose choose either the large system or the individual systems. Individual small flexible systems are not unambiguously better.\n\nSo, that to me is a counterexample to small mixable pieces.\n\nOn the other hand, it's rare to find good libraries that don't try to do too much or are flexible and off the top of my head I see at least 2 common reasons. Reason 1, the writer of the library is not experienced enough to write a simple, flexible library. Reason 2, the less experience you have the more you like handrails so there is both the incentive from yourself since you lack experience you think handrails are good and the incentive from the millions of inexperienced developers who will judge your library poorly if they need any coding experience to use it.\n\nTo give an example of this second issue, imagine any library that processes data. I think the experienced programmer (maybe you'll disagree) might prefer that the only input to this system is a an abstract \"Reader\" (or a function to read if you want to think in functional terms). The user can then provide a \"reader\" to read a file, read from memory, read from the network, and probably do that in as little as a 1-3 lines of code. This means the library is easily remixed in any environment.\n\nBut the inexperienced programmer doesn't know how to write that line of code to provide the reader so they'll hate on your library and prefer the one that takes a filename, or a network address or a binary array, or a websocket, and because of that the library will need to pull in 100k lines of support code for file i\/o and networking etc... and therefore tying it to specific implementations of those features and then when someone suggests they need it to work with different implementations they'll hack in some afterthought of a configuration option instead of realizing they shouldn't have tied things together in the first place.",

                                "text": "I don't know there is an easy answer. Coming from the perspective of games would I rather have 1000 systems from which I must choose 50-150 and then manually \"mix them\" (probably man years of work to really understand all the ins and outs of each system). Or do I just want Unreal\/Unity which already made the choices and I can start immediately on the core of the experience I'm trying to provide instead of man years of engineering prep first. I'm not saying one is good and one is bad. Only that reasonable people can choose choose either the large system or the individual systems. Individual small flexible systems are not unambiguously better.\n\nSo, that to me is a counterexample to small mixable pieces.\n\nOn the other hand, it's rare to find good libraries that don't try to do too much or are flexible and off the top of my head I see at least 2 common reasons. Reason 1, the writer of the library is not experienced enough to write a simple, flexible library. Reason 2, the less experience you have the more you like handrails so there is both the incentive from yourself since you lack experience you think handrails are good and the incentive from the millions of inexperienced developers who will judge your library poorly if they need any coding experience to use it.\n\nTo give an example of this second issue, imagine any library that processes data. I think the experienced programmer (maybe you'll disagree) might prefer that the only input to this system is a an abstract \"Reader\" (or a function to read if you want to think in functional terms). The user can then provide a \"reader\" to read a file, read from memory, read from the network, and probably do that in as little as a 1-3 lines of code. This means the library is easily remixed in any environment.\n\nBut the inexperienced programmer doesn't know how to write that line of code to provide the reader so they'll hate on your library and prefer the one that takes a filename, or a network address or a binary array, or a websocket, and because of that the library will need to pull in 100k lines of support code for file i\/o and networking etc... and therefore tying it to specific implementations of those features and then when someone suggests they need it to work with different implementations they'll hack in some afterthought of a configuration option instead of realizing they shouldn't have tied things together in the first place."
