For instance, systems deliberately aimed at newer users (consider Scratch) or narrow use cases (e.g. scripting DSL for a particular app) have a good case for being opinionated. Something to build a whole business on, less so, largely for reasons Jason laid out.\n\nAlso, even leaving aside the subjectivity, what constitutes a good or bad pattern is (at least in some cases) dependent on the system and all its interactions, particularly interactions with complicated stuff like human habits and attention. So you don't necessarily know at design time what you want to encourage. Unless, you know, it's a 1-1 analog with a pattern that produces security vulns across ecosystems or somesuch, then you probably want to avoid making that the path of least resistance..."
