Hi all -- we just released the alpha of <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX</a>, a JS library for interacting with a permissionless decentralized identity infrastructure (closets analogy: decentralized-keybase-as-a-service) that makes it easy to link accounts, keys, metadata, profiles and other resources (e.g., databases, verifications) together in a user-managed way.<br/><br/>The goal is enabling apps and users to manage information directly on an open and identity-centric network, without silos or trusted servers, and in the background of whatever tech stack/data models you're using today. Doing so makes critical info user-controllable, interoperable across any context, and much easier to build with and collaborate on. It's pretty early and works best with key-based auth right now, but working with partners to make it easy to use with social logins/magic links soon. Would love any and all feedback if this fits the goals of projects you are working on!<br/><br/>More context here if you're interested (fair warning: a bit of marketing-speak and jargon) -- <a href="https://medium.com/3box/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity-48edc88e8e85">https://medium.com/3box/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity-48edc88e8e85</a>
