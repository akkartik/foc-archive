We've had this community for, what, like, 8 years now? We've shared a lot of great links, had lots of discussions. Surely most all of us know the name Turing, know about the Turing test. Heck, those Hollywood tastemakers put \"Eggs\" Benedict Cumberbatch in a movie called The Imitation Game, and it did _numbers_! Turing is top-tier pop culture for our field.\n\nSo… _why the hell doesn't anyone ever say,_ \"This paper is proper messed. It's very very very very bad.\" Because, now that I've read this paper, I'm cursed! If _anyone_ mentions Turing near me, I won't be able to resist the screaming. This lil _Alan of all time_ has taken on an entirely new texture in my life. And if you don't know what you're in for, well, I cannot wait to welcome you into this new baffled, corrupted awareness.\n\nNow, I should say it was truly an honour to have Felienne Hermans, author of one of our all-time favourite papers, <https:\/\/futureofcoding.org\/episodes\/075|A Case for Feminism In Programming Language Design>, join us. This episode format — a guest who discusses a work with us, but not _their own_ work — is something Jimmy has been encouraging us to try for a while now, and I think it turned out fabulously. And we couldn't have asked for a better first guest — or a worse first work. Enjoy!",
