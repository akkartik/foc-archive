Has anyone ever seen a <b>purely functional</b> visual programming language that does NOT visualise the code as a dataflow graph?

Not a real language, but a different 2D visual representation of a program. I find it quite expressive. But representing if/loop/etc. might be challenging.

I remember seeing this a few years ago! It sorta-kinda counts, but it's pretty much a compressed dataflow tree. To extend it to support general DAGs, you'd probably end up with boxes-and-arrows again.

The article by HaoYi is a straw man argument. His claim that the FP implementation of the recipe is superior to the imperative is absolute nonsense. They are both identical as they are an implementation of a Finite State Machine, which is not expressible in either language directly, because very few languages today include FSM syntax, even though it is one of the key fundamental components of every program. Also, in every real-world FSM you have the possibility that one of the steps will fail. Having a system fail softly on a key step failing is a very interesting aspect neglected in most languages. Erlang took the radical design decision that things can fail often, and it would just respawn the process by means of a monitoring daemon. A very workable approach, born of the need for zero intervention in telecom switches that have to stay up 24/7 and if they do go down have to only partially fail and the rest keep going, with auto restart. RIP Joe Armstrong, another very clever fellow we lost this year along with Stan Lee. By the way when i read the Avengers as a kid they were 12 cents at the corner drugstore. Marvel kept about half of the 12 cents, and with a circulation of10,000 that means if you publish twice a month that is $1200/month total revenue for the avengers. We will see about 1.2 billion earned in the first month of Averngers endgame, which is a million to one ratio, by merely changing the medium from the scorned paper comics to the more popular film medium.
