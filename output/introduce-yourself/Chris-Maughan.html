Hi, I'm a GPU Programmer. In my spare time I'm working on a live coding environment.  The integrated editor was the first job (<a href="https://github.com/cmaughan/zep">https://github.com/cmaughan/zep</a>); It has interesting features such as GPU and Qt renderers, and the ability to embed widgets inside the text - it is designed to cleanly support the features I'm going to need in the live coding environment, while allowing me to live code using optional Vim syntax.  The live code part isn't open sourced yet, but I'm hoping to get at least the graphics side of things out the door within the next 6 months.  The renderer can sample audio using FFT etc and respond to music.  I also have an experimental synthesizer along with a work in progress Orca front end to it.  Lots of toys, no time to build them - but I'm making steady progress... :wink:
