Hi all, I am Andrew Sernyak and I am a software architect at work and clojure hobbyist at my spare time from Ukraine :flag-ua:.<br/><br/>I've stumbled upon a future of coding podcast with Jonathan Edwards, then I saw Wildcard by Geoffrey Litt and so, here I am.<br/><br/>I am frustrated with the current state of things in software development and I am trying to bring back the joy of coding I once had. I've started widening my horizon by just thinking of other ways of building software, reading old programming papers and digging into computing history, instead of learning yet another js framework.<br/><br/>Currently I experiment with some ideas by creating specialized software just for myself, like web-page scraping, personal blog, etc.
