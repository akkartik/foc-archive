Hi! I’m a newcomer from Almaty, Kazakhstan. Thanks for the invite <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Cole Lawrence</span>! I moved to the US 8 years ago to go to boarding school. After getting kicked out &amp; repeating junior year 3 times, I ended up studying entrepreneurship at New York University. There, I launched &amp; failed my first startup, built the biggest entrepreneurship community &amp; worked at a few accelerators. I also became obsessed with discovering and trying new tools and products.<br/><br/>After I graduated last month, I moved to Palo Alto with my mom (55), who is starting a new business and restarted studies at Stanford. So pumped for her!<br/><br/>I’m working on building a remote school that teaches people how to be more efficient at work using nocode and visual programming tools. I think this could be something like Lambda School but I’m doing more research on that. I’m running two experiments until figure out the model:<br/><br/>1. <a href="http://optemization.com/home">Optemization</a>: agency that helps startups build &amp; automate ops without code. Made $16,520.<br/>2. <a href="http://optemization.com/automagic-upcoming">Automagic</a>: production &amp; curation of no-code &amp; ops content. Got 234 subscribers (pre-launch).<br/>&lt;/lifestory&gt;
