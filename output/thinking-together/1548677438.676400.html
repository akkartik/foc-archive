What's your favorite on-boarding experience in any code editor (in the widest sense of the word)?

i'm curious for some examples. I don't think I've ever used a code editor with an on-boarding experience. Most just start and you're left to it.<br/><br/>I feel like VSCode is gaining users for 2 reasons. The biggest is that it's probably the best editor for JavaScript and JavaScript has a huge audience. The second is it's integrated plugin marketplace. Editors have allowed modification for years but I know of none that had an integrated marketplace that make it easy to browse and handle installing/enabling/disabling/uninstalling. Most other editors I've used required manually downloading files, manually copying them to the correct places, and possibly manually telling the editor to use them.<br/><br/>In any case, when you first install VSCode it points out the marketplace and suggests installing a few plugins.

I agree with all the above, but I'll add that Atom also has those same advantages and had them before VS Code (except integrated JavaScript debugging, which VSCode had first). There might be some additional insights that could come from looking at Atom vs. VSCode, but I suspect the issue was just performance problems in Atom.

Other editors with Marketplaces that come to my mind are Sublime and IntelliJ. Though I also think that Atom/VSCode has the most accessible one.

I'm specifically curious in onboarding into the editing experience. What I find amazing is that VI(M) doesn't really have one but has enough of a reputation that people go through the pains of learning it somehow

&gt; Other editors with Marketplaces that come to my mind are Sublime<br/><br/>I was unaware that sublimetext had a market. Googling for "sublimetext plugin market" only brings up a 3rd party manager. The sublimetext home page says nothing about a market. Am I missing it? Note: Lots of editors have plugins since the 80s, google "emacs addons" or "vim addons" you just had to find them and install them yourself. That's different from an official market.

Oh, maybe it's third party. Back when I was using it everybody in my circle of friends/colleagues had it as well so I thought it was official
