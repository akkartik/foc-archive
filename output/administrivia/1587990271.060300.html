Unfortunately I need to leave this community.<br/><br/>According to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> I've violated Code of Conduct by making following sexist comment:<br/><br/>&gt; Men are more interested in things, women are more interested in people.<br/>Ivan Reese reached me out, carefully explained why this comment was sexist and politely asked me to not make any new posts of such kind. He also kindly asked me to not voice up an opposition to inclusion and diversity initiatives.<br/><br/>I see nothing wrong with my comment. I based it on scientific article, reference to which I included in the comment.<br/><br/>I did not oppose diversity and inclusion initiatives per se, I just cannot silently approve reasoning in group identity terms. I think that reasoning in terms of group identity is dangerous and I can politely argue why. It appears that even arguing why it is bad is not allowed here. For me this is too much.<br/><br/>I would prefer to keep politics out of this community, but apparently it is not an option.<br/><br/>Thus, I will be removed from this community sooner or later for another Code of Conduct violation. Correct solution to this problem for me would be to leave now.<br/><br/>I will continue to work on generic tree editor. I hope to communicate with members of this community over twitter. Probably I would even create videos for #two-minute-week, just post them on <a href="https://twitter.com/vladimir_vg">twitter</a>, not here.<br/><br/>As a last message in this Slack I want to post a response that I was preparing to the deleted comments before I received a warning from Ivan Reese. I will post it as a comment to this message.<br/><br/>Personally I would like to thank Ivan for acting in a polite and respectful manner, even though we clearly had disagreements.<br/><br/>Bye!

Maybe you wonder why I take statements about diversity and inclusion so seriously? Why I don't just shut up and return to working on FoC projects instead?<br/><br/>Members of this community come from diverse backgrounds. I am from exUSSR country which makes me 3% among other members according to Question Nine in the Survey. Maybe I have some insights that other members don't due to their background?<br/><br/>Group identity ideologies have very very bad history in my country.<br/><br/>Group identity ideology led to the Civil War in Tsarist Russia, which caused death of 10.7 millions of people.<br/><br/>Group identity ideology led to massive deportations of Chechens, Koreans, Wolga Germans, and other peoples in USSR. Groups of people were accused of "being sympathetic to the enemy" solely based on their ethnicity. Hundreds of thousands died during the process of deportation.<br/><br/>Millions of Russians don't know their own heritage, because their grandmothers and grandfathers had to keep their mouths shut to not be identified with a "wrong" group.<br/><br/>Group identity ideology was a driving mechanism of Red Terror (1917–1922) which got killed up to 100.000 people. Family legend says that my great grandfather was one of the victims.<br/><br/>Here is what Martin Latsis, one of the prominent participants in the Red Terror, has to say about his decision making:<br/><br/>&gt; We are not fighting against single individuals. We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class. Do not look in materials you have gathered for evidence that a suspect acted or spoke against the Soviet authorities. The first question you should ask him is what class he belongs to, what is his origin, education, profession. These questions should determine his fate. This is the essence of the Red Terror[1].<br/>Of course, we are not living in XX century anymore, no one would get tortured or killed today. Instead, people would be excluded or silenced, as it happened in USSR. As it happens in other tech communities.<br/><br/>Judging person solely on his group identity is <b>wrong</b>. That's is why racial discrimination is wrong. That's why sexism is wrong. That's why unfair filtering of Asian applicants in Harvard is wrong [2].<br/><br/>Just like I cannot stay silent when some Nazi guy casually uses Übermensch and Untermensch notions to reason about people, I cannot stay silent when people use terms like "underrepresented group". It is equaly dangerous to think in those terms.<br/><br/>[1] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Latsis&amp;oldid=943762048">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Latsis&amp;oldid=943762048</a><br/>[2] <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/harvard-asian-enrollment-applicants.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/harvard-asian-enrollment-applicants.html</a>

You may not read this message but if this is going to sit here in public view it deserves some counterpoints.<br/><br/>Firstly, the position you just explained conflicts with your prior statement about men and women, wherein you partitioned the human race into two group identities and made judgements about the characteristics of each of those groups. Perhaps that requires further consideration.<br/><br/>Secondly, "diversity and inclusion" is not about dividing people into groups -- it's about eradicating the idea of groups. To counteract discrimination, sometimes you have to apply an "equal and opposite force" to repair the damage. That's all these initiatives are for. Sometimes they're implemented badly and are more tokenistic than practical, but that's a separate issue. Personally, tokenism drives me up the wall.<br/><br/>I think your above post is excessive. Nobody here is starting a eugenics program, and there is sure to be a diversity of beliefs within this community. I attempt to maintain amicability (note: not confirmity) with others, because some degree of cultural compatibility is required for any physical or digital society to function effectively. I'm personally not from North America, and I do not identify as "left wing" or "right wing", but I have my individual beliefs, and I wouldn't appreciated being classified under your preferred label.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd rather just talk about (and implement) the future of coding, and support everyone who wants to be involved in that. Basic cultural compatibility is required, but it's a low bar.

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Vladimir Gordeev</span> I had a partial response to your question directed at me in the other thread. I'll finish and post it here, as Ivan has made multiple requests in that thread to not take it off topic. What you asked:<br/>&gt; Given:<br/>&gt; Discussing politics is allowed by CoC<br/>&gt; Various members reason in left-wing terms, thinking that it is the only way<br/>&gt; Objecting to reasoning in left-wing terms(group identity) is not welcome<br/>&gt; Arguing that left-wing reasoning is not the only way is not welcome either<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Computes to:<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Gradual removal of all members of community that don't align politically with left-wing ideas in the long term.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Am I wrong in my reasoning?<br/>Yes I think that reasoning is wrong. I certainly don't want people who identify as right-wing to feel excluded here. I'll make some points:<br/>1. Thinking is multi-dimensional and its not always easy to reduce it to a single dimension (left/right). Rather we can look at different stances/aspects independently. In this case it is diversity but consider economic models (capitalism vs...?) or organization models (centralized vs distributed vs ...) and I think you'll find different sets of people align with different ideas. I certainly don't like to be being reduced to "left-wing thinking" and I'm not sure it even means the same thing in all countries. Just like programming is multi-dimensional and we shouldn't reduce it something trivial like 'static vs dynamic typing'.<br/>2. Imagine I said "I'm interested in doing A" and person X said "that's not interesting, a waste of time and it's not going to work". OK, maybe not a great way to put it, but X can disagree, it's fine. I can still work on my initiative. Now imagine person Y goes "that's not worthwhile and I've already taken some concrete steps to foil your work on A". Now that's going a bit too far. That's the challenge when you consider initiative A = diversity. <em>We're working with people, not computers, and just saying things (such as stereotyping all members of a group that you are not part of) will put off people and foil our plans on this initiative</em>. Which is why it's important to be sensitive in this discussion, specially when it appears that you are not being <em>personally</em> disadvantaged by this specific initiative.<br/>3. Lets imagine for a moment what you're saying happens: that people who identify as 'left wing' (L) hang around while those that identify as 'right wing' (R) leave in the long term. Does this mean that R are less interested in FoC than L? Certainly looking at this slack someone could say so! What if some L folk then infer that R folk are "just not interested" in this topic? Would they be correct in their "evidence based" inference? I guess what I'm trying to get as is this: if you feel excluded because of the Code of Conduct's position on <em>one issue</em> which you associate with being against right-wing, consider what would happen if someone (who does not identify as R) makes a broad statement that "Rs are just not interested in FoC" and then provides the evidence above? Indeed, I believe such a statement would be against the Code of Conduct as well! (I also wonder if you see the irony in saying "left wing" and "group identity" in the same sentence)<br/>I hope that helps clear things up a bit.

(I was in the process of writing this comment before Zubair posted, and I'll respond to that separately below)<br/><br/>I'm also going to respond here for the sake of posterity, not expecting that Vladimir will read it.<br/><br/>&gt; Men are more interested in things, women are more interested in people.<br/>I'd like to explain why this is sexist, so that if anyone has any doubts in the future I can refer them here. The easiest way for me to make the case is to include a bit more context from the original message, which I deleted as a Code of Conduct violation:<br/><br/>&gt; There is nothing morally wrong about having 100% male community. Men and women statistically tend to have different interests [1]. Men are more interested in things, women are more interested in people. That might be the reason why this community is predominantly male. Nothing wrong about it.<br/>&gt; Although having more female members would be great.<br/>&gt; [1] <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19883140">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19883140</a><br/>First, there is something wrong with the fact that the community is 100% male, and this is something that multiple people had previously tried to explain to Vladimir again and again <a href="1581999680.035700.html">in this thread</a>. That is: we've heard many times from both women and men that they don't want to participate because the community is 100% male and has resulting problems. (It's not worth burning the calories to argue whether this issue is about morality or not, so I'm ignoring that additional layer of categorization, since it never appeared in any of the other arguments and seems like a distinction without a difference.) The very podcast episode and survey results that spawned this discussion even included <em>multiple</em> examples of people telling us that they don't feel like participating for this reason (though, sadly, I had to omit a very compelling one of them because the author asked that it be kept private.)<br/><br/>Vladimir ignored all of this, and chose instead to attribute the cause of the absence of women from the community to psychological sex differences. The implication being: women would not be interested in this community because they aren't interested in "things" like programming tools.<br/><br/>It's sexist to characterize women in this way. It perpetuates a stereotype. It sends a signal to any women reading that they aren't expected to be interested in programming, not in the same way that men are. It narrows the scope of reasons that women may be interested in participating down to a binary. It's also the sort of unfounded characterization that women have been ceaselessly subjected to in tech (not to mention elsewhere), that countless women have come forward and asked for people to stop making. So in that way, it's also disrespectful.<br/><br/>That's why I deleted it. It's exactly the sort of statement that would keep women from feeling welcome here, and we serve to gain nothing from considering that line of reasoning since it had already been resoundingly disproven, so there's tremendous downside and no upside to allowing that message to remain.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Zubair Quraishi</span> — Vladimir was never asked to leave, and from the very start I've actually been encouraging him to stay. I've spent many hours messaging with him in private, and I've consistently maintained that he is perfectly welcome to keep participating, only contingent on him not continuing to act in a way that makes other people uncomfortable, which I did my best to explain unambiguously and in depth. Throughout our private conversations, he seemed to me to be kind and considerate, and thinking very deeply about the issue. We managed to get down to what I feel is the root of his concerns, and I provided examples of how I approach thinking about the topic and how I take his concerns seriously and don't intend to do any of the things he was concerned about happening.<br/><br/>He's decided to leave because, as I understand it, he wants to be able to argue against the language people use when they talk about diversity. He doesn't think it's appropriate for people to use terms like "systemic", "intersectional", or even the terms "diversity" and "inclusion", because he believes they're associated with a left-wing political viewpoint, and that introduces a degree of bias that leads to issues. In response to that, I've asked that he be more careful about how he respond to other people here — that he avoid labeling things as "left-wing" or "politically biased" and instead explain what he means by those terms. He's also voiced some concern about the diversity initiatives themselves, that they might (my words, not his) degrade the quality of our community by moving the focus away from tech. So I asked that he stop openly voicing opposition to our diversity initiatives. We had already had a big discussion about that <a href="1581999680.035700.html">here</a> in #administrivia and elsewhere. Earlier, I had said that people are no longer welcome to oppose our diversity initiatives, and I think that bothered him a lot, which I can understand. I did a bad job of expressing my thinking at that time, and clarified it for him <a href="../thinking-together/1587796981.183100.html#1587977012.290100">here</a>. I also asked that he not continue to push the matter in the #thinking-together thread about our new podcast episode. He (and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ache</span>) refused to respect that request, which they're perfectly allowed to do, it just means they're not acting in an amicable way. I haven't been either, but only because I've been forced to do some comment moderation, which I don't feel good about.<br/><br/>As I explained a moment ago, I had to delete one of his comments because it included a kind of subversive sexism that I will not allow in this community. As far as I can tell, he meant no harm, but that's irrelevant.<br/><br/>This stuff is hard, but I'm doing my best. I have learned a lot from this experience. I don't like how I've handled things generally. However, sexism is not allowed and I feel I was correct to remove it. But I never said that Vladimir was unwelcome, and I've spent a considerable amount of time trying to show him that he is, and help him have opportunities to express his concerns and let me address them.

Identity politics tends to deny any relation between attributes and outcomes wrt typical identity categories and claim that any differences in outcome must be the result of oppression which they propose to correct through coercive interventions. Communism took this to it’s natural extreme by coercively removing everything that might distinguish outcomes (even differences in art, music, belief, etc) and even if this meant killing millions of dissidents.

My layperson's take on such conversations when both sides are arguing in good faith (as is happening here, but is by no means universal):<br/><br/>Yes, there are some trade-offs, and it's possible for the pendulum to swing too far in the other direction as Vladimir is warning us. But <em>it hasn't happened yet here</em>, and meanwhile we're trying to repair very real damage. So I have sympathy for both sides, but it seems very clear that Ivan's taking the side that's more urgent. I would counsel people who share the opposite concerns to keep their powder dry (because it's <em>incredibly</em> hard to air such concerns without adding to the damage being repaired) so that <em>they can speak up when it really matters</em>. If you get dismissed early (with good reason) you lose that opportunity. This is my current strategy.<br/><br/>(I don't know how clear I am being since I'm trying hard to choose my words carefully. But please ask for clarification and I'll try to iterate. My position seems internally consistent and non-hypocritical, at least to me.)

Virtually all women in technology communities have stories of times they've felt uncomfortable, excluded, overlooked, etc. Those issues are all structural and would scare anyone away from any community.<br/><br/>Statements like "Women like people, men like things" lead to unactionable lines of thinking.<br/>To women who experience day to day issues within their tech communities you can imagine how frustrating and alienating it is to drive the conversation away from actionable improvements that can be made.<br/><br/>A community will struggle to better humanity if a significant portion of humanity is pushed away. When the status quo is unwelcoming (or hostile) to so many it's critical to take effort to become more welcoming than the status quo.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Vladimir Gordeev</span> we do have a lot of people with different backgrounds here.  As you point out being from an exUSSR country, you have reasons for feeling uncomfortable.  Similarly <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> tried to share with you how it is that a "men are... women are..." comment definitely doesn't sit well with others.  Independent of intent, there are contexts where that kind of comment signals the sort of "group identity ideology" that worries you.  We're all learning all the time how to speak to each other respectfully.  It sucks to irrate someone, to step over an invisible line of comfort, especially unintentionally.  I've done that sort of thing (probably not in this forum hopefully despite sarcastic Ruby and Haskell comments), and it does not feel great being addressed about it.  For me, I just have to recognize that that whoever is going to the trouble to say something is going out on a limb.  If they're attentive, they'll know it's not going to make for an easy conversation.  They clearly have their own reasons feeling it is important.<br/><br/>I don't know the best way to react.  What I try to do is set aside my own perspective.  See where that person is coming from.  Maybe ask about their own experience.  Listen without justifying.  Even, especially if I feel strongly, I find I really have to understand the other person's perspective before beginning to try to reconcile.  I personally haven't gotten that far with a lot of things.  So times it's easier to leave well enough alone.<br/><br/>So Vladimir, if you need to step away, do  that.  But I hope overall we here would want you to find a place in the community without feeling alienated and without alienating others.

Well, I have to say, I agree with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Vladimir Gordeev</span>’s original comment and disagree that it could reasonably be called a code-of-conduct violation.<br/><br/>Yes, the quoted sentence "Men are more interested in things blah blah blah" is not correct when it is taken out of context. But if you read the sentence prior to it, I think it's fair to infer that the <em>literal</em> meaning of the sentence was not the <em>intended</em> meaning. The prior sentence says "Men and women statistically tend to have different interests [1]."<br/><br/>He even provided a reference to a widely-cited scientific metastudy (over 800 citations) to back this up. Thing-orientation is not a concept that was made up to justify sexism. It is a concept defined and used in scientific literature. Here's another paper on the same subject. [2]<br/><br/>[1] <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19883140">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19883140</a><br/>[2] <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00320.x">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00320.x</a><br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> When you say "women would not be interested in this community because they aren't interested in 'things' like programming tools" you are simply putting words in his mouth. He didn't say that and I don't believe for one second that he meant that.

I actually spent 9 years on OKCupid looking for a woman that shared my interest in programming. In all that time, do you know how many women I found in my city whose online dating profile expressed an interest in programming? Zero. One day out of curiosity I searched for male profiles that talked about programming, and there were several results. These are <b>facts</b>. My lived experience seems to agree with the scientific literature. I do know that some women are interested in programming and I have met some in person. But it's clear to me that the ratio is strongly skewed toward men. <b>I wish it weren't this way.</b> If more women were into programming, I could have married one and we could be making things together. Instead I have to make things on my own and my wife doesn't understand and doesn't care what I am creating. This is not what I wanted. But it's reality.<br/><br/>You can say, "well, the fact that there are too many men drives the women away." Maybe. But when I learned to program, I didn't know <b>any</b> programmers, no males and no females. I didn't go look at the gender balance and say "ahh, more males, this must be an appropriate field for me!" I think there was something inside me, let's call it "thing-orientation", which caused me to be interested in programming despite the fact that I didn't know anyone who was a programmer.<br/><br/>What's offensive about recognizing that women are less likely to have this natural interest?

What's problematic is that comments like that are likely to discourage any interested women from participating. Are there really zero women interested in topics discussed in this slack? Note that there are many women in PL/HCI (<a href="1588014176.074700.html">1588014176.074700.html</a>), many women also interested in FoC (<a href="1588020434.093200.html">1588020434.093200.html</a>) and finally, quoting Ivan <em>"we've heard many times from both women and men that they don't want to participate because the community is 100% male and has resulting problems."</em> So after all these points of data, it's damaging to quote some study about different interests. Clearly, interest is <b>not</b> the problem here. So how is the quote even relevant? (If one really wants to research and be helpful, how about go looking for studies to support (or weaken) the argument that a large group genderX/raceX/cultureX will be intimidating to new people not in that group?) The comment is certainly a violation (the level of intention is not that relevant - manslaughter is still a crime). In any case, only the comment was removed and explanation was provided. AFAIK, Vladimir was not asked to leave.

I also want to bring up a subtle philosophical point which I think is often missed. "Programming" is not a field with a hard boundary set in stone. It is not like a fixed size garment, handed down from Gods, that just happens to fit "men" better. It is itself a <em>human created</em> artifact, shaped and molded by us. So what programming "is" or "should be" is itself fluid, and it is up to us to shape it further however we want it to look.

Thanks for all the thinking that has gone on related to this topic. For me I actually have the opinion that women invented IT (<a href="https://www.space.com/34675-harvard-computers.html">https://www.space.com/34675-harvard-computers.html</a>) and with Grace Hopper and others, and men basically stole the whole IT field around the 1960s when it became big business (in those days women were looked down on in alot of society). Having said that there are some "general" differences in the sexes (on average I mean) that language can get in the way of expressing things which I think may happen with "women are ..."and "men are ..." type comments. Having said all that I work in a company where it feels like 1% of technical people are women. We do everything we can to hire women, but they just don't want to work in technical jobs for a variety of personal and historical reasons. I think in this forum we should actually be taking "advantage" of the difference between the sexes to make systems that men, women, other genders, autistic, introvert, extrovert, etc, and  all personality and brain types will want to use the developmnt tools that we build

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@David Piepgrass</span> You made one particular point that Vladimir also made in our private chats, which deserves to be questioned: is there any reason that a published scientific study can't be sexist? Any reason why this particular study isn't likely to be sexist? To me, it seems especially likely, given the subject matter, despite whatever ethics review the study was subject to, because this domain is fiendishly difficult to navigate without perpetuating extremely subtle and deeply buried biases. So pointing to its status as <em>official real science</em> as an indication of its harmlessness is unsound, in my view.<br/><br/>Not to mention: there's so much folly in taking most any social psych study and trying to apply the findings any more broadly than the studied population. The replication crisis is a thing, after all.

As for the "where are the women programmers? I've looked and can't find them" factor — let's not rely on personal experience, because it's an uneven world out there. I'm married to a programmer, but we met at an artsy coffee shop because she does experimental leatherwork and I do experimental music. The fact that we both code was random luck. I work on a team where we have just as many women coders as men coders, but that's because we trained them to code (the women and the men — everyone was hired as an artist, including me, and learned to code on the job). A bunch of my female friends in the music scene also picked up programming, so they could make wilder music — none of my male friends did. There are plenty of women coders in the world, and we can easily make more by helping people learn. We just need to raise our own expectations about what "normal" should be.

One of my closest friends is also a woman who likes coding. But I had to help her learn to code in her free time, because her parents pressured her into a different career path! So many factors at play.
