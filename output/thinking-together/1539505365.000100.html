let me also add there's a "spirit of giving". I contribute to open source for free because I've received so many other open source things for free. I get that some projects need funding like say openssl <br/><br/>but I recently managed to get a contract to do some open source work and I feel like I can't mention I'm getting paid otherwise contributors might feel like not contributing unless they also get paid. maybe that's fair but it does point out yet another complication
