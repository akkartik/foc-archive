Hello Friends,<br/><br/>I've been kicking around this Slack since roughly the get-go, since Steve Krouse started the FoC podcast, since before the introduce-yourself channel, so I've never introduced myself properly.  You'll most often find me sharing Rubyisms, mixed reality musings, spacial computing speculations, and the rare Aspect Oriented reflection, while being mostly busy writing little, tricky Rails apps for running big auctions.  What with a good chunk of 5G spectrum allocated and 6G only a glint, I have the chance to dedicate some proper time to FoC projects.  I want to work on something!  Who is looking for a comrade, a consultant, a hired hand, or to just chat?<br/><br/>Most anything and everything I see on the FoC Slack matches my interests remarkably well.  Most recently, in the process of distilling lessons learned from fourteen years of modeling the domain of umpteen slightly yet significantly different auctions, a shockingly beautiful conceptual crystal sublimated, a not-so-future-required technique for leveraging data's functional dependencies to make long-distance object referencing reasonable.<br/><br/>For instance, with <tt>the.package_bid = some_package_bid</tt>, we can talk about <tt>the.price</tt>, <tt>the.bidder</tt>, even <tt>the.previous(:round).price</tt> short for what might usually amount to going up and down a tree:<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">some_package_bid.area_bid.round_bid.round.previous.<br/>  round_bid(some_package_bid.area_bid.round_bid.bidder).<br/>  area_bid(some_package_bid.area_bid.area).<br/>  package_bids(some_package_bid.encumbrance_level).<br/>  find{_1.option == some_package_bid.option}.<br/>  price</pre>

I have been making some more progress in a my code explorer. Would be great to collaborate on it <a href="https://minimalistidev2.netlify.app/?repository=https://gist.github.com/pel-daniel/f7871a63f0222fff8b7257f5f9b35916&amp;data=eyJpIjoxMSwidiI6W3siaSI6MTAsInYiOlt7ImkiOjIsInYiOltdfSx7ImkiOjMsInYiOltdfSx7ImkiOjQsInYiOltdfSx7ImkiOjYsInYiOlt7ImkiOjcsInYiOltdfSx7ImkiOjgsInYiOlt7ImkiOjcsInYiOltdfV19LHsiaSI6OSwidiI6W119XX0seyJpIjo1LCJ2IjpbXX0seyJpIjoxLCJ2IjpbXX1dfV19">https://minimalistidev2.netlify.app/?repository=https://gist&hellip;</a><br/>Also I've been thinking a lot about 3D codebases lately, if you want to do something in this area

We should chat Daniel.  The code explorer looks really cute.  I'm reminded of Code Bubbles <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~spr/codebubbles/">http://cs.brown.edu/~spr/codebubbles/</a> and Code Canvas <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/code-canvas/">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/code-canvas/</a>, both from more than a decade ago now.  :flushed:<br/><br/>Clicking around, I have a few questions immediately:<br/>• What's with the extra brackets in conditionals e.g. <tt>else {{showMessage(PICK_EMPTY_CELL, player)}}</tt>?<br/>• In the "Search functions by name" field, if I write "turn", <tt>winInColumns</tt> matches.  I have no idea why.<br/>• I find the asymmetry between the CALL TREE area and the main area a little jarring.  I mean in the CALL TREE, a function can be shown, hidden, or unlisted whereas in the main area, a function can be shown, collapsed, or unlisted.<br/>Honestly though.  This is very neat.  I like the mouseover references.  I see a lot of potential.  I love how the URL encodes the view state.  That is slick.

Code Bubbles is a big influence for sure, thanks for reminding me about Code Canvas I should see what makes sense ~stealing~ incorporating<br/>&gt; • What's with the extra brackets in conditionals e.g. <tt>else {{showMessage(PICK_EMPTY_CELL, player)}}</tt>?<br/>A bug :confused:<br/><br/>&gt;  In the "Search functions by name" field, if I write "turn", <tt>winInColumns</tt> matches.  I have no idea why.<br/>:thinking_face: That's weird, I'm using a fuzzy search package, I'll take a look into it<br/><br/>&gt;  I find the asymmetry between the CALL TREE area and the main area a little jarring.  I mean in the CALL TREE, a function can be shown, hidden, or unlisted whereas in the main area, a function can be shown, collapsed, or unlisted.<br/>Yeah the UX is pretty much WIP. So I have many ideas of interactions but I'm still not sure which ones are useful :sweat_smile:<br/>Close to the right, close, collapse, show/hide will have really different use cases, but I can't be sure which ones to keep until I test them with a real project. Which takes me to the current work. I'm using the GitHub API to get the information, but it has a rate limit of 50 req/hour, so I haven't been able to play with a medium size project to see what's useful. Right now I'm working on the backend to add authenticated GitHub API requests which will increase the rate limit to 5,000/h.<br/><br/>Anyways, I'd love to chat <span style="background-color:#ccf">@William Taysom</span>, are you available during the weekend?

UIs usually are a work in progress!  I just thought it might be helpful to hear what stands out.  Your double bracket bug makes me think of the weirdest escape sequence interpretation problem I ever saw.  In some project a long while back in order to get a backslash we had to write something like <tt>"\\\\\\"</tt>.
