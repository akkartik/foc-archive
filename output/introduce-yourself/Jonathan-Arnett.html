Hello folks! My name is Jonathan but I go by "J3RN" in many places on the net (there are also other J3RNs, so beware).  I've been programming for a bit over a decade now with most of that time spent doing web development.  Specifically, I worked in Ruby on Rails for ~5 years and have been working in Elixir and Phoenix for ~4.  I've never really been satisfied by the tools available and have been longing for a way to help developers comprehend software systems.  I'm interested in programming languages, IDE design, code visualizations, and other developer-centric HCI topics.<br/><br/>I'm currently located in Ohio, so let me know if you're in-state and maybe we can meet up (or establish a meetup!)
