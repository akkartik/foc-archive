Governance on open source projects is a big problem. Consider Chrome, which is nominally open source but does more and more sketchy things. This is a general pattern. As you get more users you gain in leverage, and the temptation to use your leverage in short-term ways. That is unproductive in the long run for all concerned. Users eventually route around rot, that's how companies eventually grow irrelevant. And routing around companies takes a lot of effort that could be used elsewhere. Why not attack the problem at its source: the Principal Agent problem. More broad-based involvement would lead to a more healthy, less toxic relationship for both sides.
