Hi all!<br/>I'm a web applications developer. I'm really excited by the idea of bringing programming to a less technical audience, in a way that they can easily understand, whilst being based on rigorous paradigms (without making a big song and dance about that), and having their work translate down to something a professional programmer could (and would be glad to) inherit.<br/>I've been catching up on the podcast slowly but surely and it seems like this is a community that has much in common with me. Glad to be here!

Hi Xandor!<br/>I am looking forward to learning more about your ideas regarding simplifying web development. Brother and I have been working on a project (<a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/">https://wasp-lang.dev/</a> - it is still very early) where we are looking to achieve very similar thing -&gt; we would like to make web app development much simpler for developers first, and then possibly also for non-developers, while keeping up with the current ecosystem. We think way to do this might be by building a (declarative) domain specific language specialized for web app development.<br/>Let me know if this seems interesting, and I hope we will anyway have some discussion on this topic!

Hi Martin! I've actually already seen your project and subscribed a while ago :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>I like that your project is taking a declarative approach, I think it's easier to understand (assuming that the DSL reifies the <em>right abstraction</em>) for programmers and regular people in general.<br/>I also have a vision of building stuff lower down the stack that would initially be useful to programmers, but what I'll build on that foundation in the future would be useful to non-programmers.<br/>My vision is to first define a subset of JS that is purely functional. I've been able to do this to a fair degree using ESLint + Flow, but it doesn't go far enough, there are some serious gaps in Flow, such as no higher-kinded types, trouble understanding auto-curried functions (TypeScript is even <em>less</em> capable in this regard). I may have to write my own typechecker :sweat_smile:<br/>Then I'd like to take a leaf out of Luna's book and provide a visual way of representing code that conforms to this subset.<br/>On top of this basis I may build declarative tools that work at a higher level.<br/>I hadn't considered using a DSL.<br/>Would be happy to chat more

Oh great, glad to hear you subscribed :slightly_smiling_face:!<br/><br/>Exactly, that is why we are focusing on declarative approach for now, because we think it can be really simple to use. However, as you mentioned, it is important to pick the right abstractions so that the resulting DSL is simple, powerful, but also flexible enough, and that is tricky, we are focusing on that a lot at the moment, examining popular web frameworks in order to figure out the right abstractions. Also, not everything can be reasonably made declarative, so we are trying to figure out which features are good to describe in declarative fashion and which are not, and how to approach those down the road.<br/><br/>Standalone DSL also comes with its own set of problems -&gt; all the support (IDE) that language needs, integration with existing languages and solutions, ...<br/><br/>It seems we share the big vision, although we have different approaches - very exciting, I would be happy to share insights in the future!<br/><br/>I hope you don't mind me asking, what is the motivation for using a functional subset of JS? Is that to provide "safer"/simpler experience to developers? And/or is it to enable you to build the next step, the visual editor, on a good foundation that matches the visual way of representing the web app?<br/>Also, what about solutions like Purescript? I am guessing you want to go with Javascript due to its popularity and how easy it is to use? That certainly makes sense, just wondering hm!<br/><br/>Btw. is there a way to follow your work, maybe somewhere to subscribe? If not I will just keep my eyes open here on FoC slack!

&gt; I hope you don't mind me asking, what is the motivation for using a functional subset of JS? Is that to provide "safer"/simpler experience to developers? And/or is it to enable you to build the next step, the visual editor, on a good foundation that matches the visual way of representing the web app?<br/>It is for both of these reasons. Purely functional code is <em>very</em> declarative, and thus is much better suited to a visual representation. I also want a safer/simpler experience for developers. The final vision I have is very ambitious, and may not be feasible for me to achieve. In working towards that vision, as I am building the pieces required for it, those pieces should be <em>independently useful</em> for others. If I am not successful at any given point of my journey towards the final vision, what I have built up until that point should still be a net win for me in the work that I am doing at the time.<br/><br/>&gt; Also, what about solutions like Purescript? I am guessing you want to go with Javascript due to its popularity and how easy it is to use? That certainly makes sense, just wondering hm!<br/>I have considered compile-to-JS solutions, but I have issue with the community size, the ecosystem size, and the interop (they all promise 100% interop with JS on the box, but the reality is sometimes not so easy). Having said that, I'm likely to have the same challenges, there's more to interop than syntax, transpilation and module systems.<br/>Mostly, though, the biggest concern I have is <em>inheritability</em>. I want a project that was created using my stack to be inheritable even to programmers that aren't necessarily familiar with FP. Although they may struggle to understand code they've inherited from me at first if they're not accustomed to FP, if that code is just a subset of JS, they can disable/remove the tooling that limits the code to a subset, and carry on with the project more easily using the paradigms that they are already familiar with.<br/>I think this is one of the big issues with low-/no-code tools atm, they're walled gardens: there's literally <em>no code</em>, users are just configuring an instance of the vendor's platform. I want to build something that is genuinely inheritable, not just on paper, but in a very practical sense. (there are also many other problems with no-code that I hope to tackle).<br/>It is for this reason that the entire stack needs to be open source, and its pieces should strive to be independently useful. I aim to build communities around each piece so that there will be some measure of support for those that <em>do</em> inherit from me.<br/>&gt; Btw. is there a way to follow your work, maybe somewhere to subscribe? If not I will just keep my eyes open here on FoC slack!<br/>Not yet. I've got some abstracts and notes written out (and the 1st stab at the ESLint + Flow config), but I haven't published anything.<br/>I'll be taking paternity leave soon (:tada:), so I hope to put together something public-facing during that downtime.<br/>I'll be sure to update here when that happens.

Congrats :tada:  :slightly_smiling_face:!<br/><br/>What is your reason for inheritability, do you think that will be the common case with the audience you are targeting?<br/>I believe there is a reason why inheritability is not present in no-code / low-code tools -&gt; because it is hard to achieve, and at the end for most of them it is not that important, due to the use case they are catering to. But of course, if they did have inheritability, they could target more / different use cases, since developers could use it for prototyping and similar.<br/><br/>With Wasp, we have been looking at two things: inheritability and extensibility.<br/>Extensibility would actually be interop that you mentioned -&gt; can we allow people to combine/use existing parts of JS ecosystem together with Wasp, intermingled with Wasp?<br/>And inheritability -&gt; can we allow people to "eject" the code made by Wasp, so they can continue with it? We are mentioning that on our landing page.<br/>In our case, extensibility is a must, while we would really like to have inheritability because it removes the "lock-in" effect, but we are aware it might be hard to achieve it, and its importance will be smaller and smaller as Wasp becomes more and more mature, so we are still evaluating how much time does it make sense to invest into inheritability.

one of the problems with no code (and frameworks too, though not as strongly) is that if a project is successful, it will outgrow the initial platform on which its built. In the case of a framework, you can do a rewrite that still re-uses a lot of the existing code. In the case of a no-code platform, you have to rewrite from scratch.<br/>The problem is that success for a lot of projects doesn't necessarily mean that there is money for a team of professional developers to rewrite. Success might mean that a no-code app is heavily relied upon internally, but the company couldn't afford to rewrite it.<br/>No-code tools generally solve the problem of writing the code. But that's often all they solve. Syntax is not the hard part of coding (after a few months). The hard part is keeping things well organised and adaptable.<br/>When a regular codebase gets out of hand, the code can be analysed and refactored with the help of tools. When a no-code app gets out of hand, :man-shrugging: . (I predict a healthy industry of useless no-code consultants that will help companies "maintain" no-code apps whilst making things worse, in about 5-10 years' time. Just look at sharepoint.)<br/><br/>I'm even hoping to have back-and-forth. If a developer writes code that adheres to the FP JS subset, I can generate a visual representation of it (the visual rep is just a projection of the AST, much like e.g. Prettier just projects the AST).<br/>This would change no-code from a binary proposition (either yes or no), to a spectrum.<br/>Citizen devs can make most of the "boring" parts of the app, and call in a pro when they get stuck. The pro can use the interface she's used to (text). It won't be a choice between sticking with a no-code ball of mud, or an expensive complete rewrite by a team of devs. Each party can play to their strengths.<br/><br/>If its not inheritable, it represents a lot of risk to companies. Vendor lock-in risk, rewrite risk, etc. which makes it less appealing. Knowing you can hit eject (or not even eject, but add a pro dev to a citizen dev team), will be an attractive proposition, and as you said, can also be used as a prototyping tool.

Makes sense, I guess we could say there are two main benefits: 1. no lock-in effect, allowing platform to grow and 2. duality of the codebase, in the way that it can be worked upon by both devs and non-devs.<br/><br/>We are both achieving second point by restricting and organizing the code in such way that it allows us to build additional tools on top of it that utilize this structure to offer simpler interaction with the code (visual editor).<br/>However, we are doing it via DSL that has interoop with JS, while you are doing it by restricting JS.<br/><br/>Well this is all so exciting, I wish I had more to share but we also don't know yet exactly how will DSL perform -&gt; but you are on our subscription list so we will notify you in couple of months when we release the first MVP! Looking forward to seeing how your solution develops :slightly_smiling_face:.
