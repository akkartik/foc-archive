I know you've probably all seen this already, but as someone who wants to some day teach computation, this talk was revolutionary. Learning to program in the 2010s where everything seemed to funnel me towards JavaScript For Everything, avoiding dogma in education (and not just computational education!) Is a lovely and highly applicable message. just found it a few days ago, would love to hear about any projects folks are working on/loving that fit into the four categories Bret is talking about here (specially if anyone is teaching/building curricula exploring the fullness of computational thought in primary/secondary education) <a href="https://vimeo.com/71278954">https://vimeo.com/71278954</a>
