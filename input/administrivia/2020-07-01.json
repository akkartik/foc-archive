Even though in French there is an exact similar expression (which is more and more seen as old and is less used) it is not easy to figure out the potential \"harm\" of this one.\nBut for me, as I know Edward's style, that can be a bit rude and that he likes to rant, I can read between the lines and filter out such language (and to be honest, I missed this particular one).\nBut of course, new people don't know him, and does this kind of language make them find the community unwelcoming? Maybe some friendly reminder from anyone in the community, in reply to the corresponding post could be enough to openly show that this language does not fit the spirit of the community?"
