Folks for whom execution speed is critical are likely not using Python to begin with, or are served well by numpy or use Cython for the critical path, which does not force them to switch to a new ecosystem. Pypy seems to have found its niche in larger organizations that can afford to employ experts on maintaining it and its dependencies. I think it's been a valuable experiment, but like IronPython and Jython (not to mention a slew of less successful abandoned attempts), it runs up against a standard implementation that is good enough, and will always be a version or two ahead, and have the most batteries included.
