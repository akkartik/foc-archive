I work with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@magicmouse94937</span>’s so-called boring accounting state machines day-to-day (they are boring :). But even the simplest is governed by events that are coming from devices all over the world, aggregated in servers all over the world, fed into streaming or batch event processors… To answer “What state is a user in?” with the value that’s stored in a particular database misses so much. Sometimes the value isn’t anywhere, because it’s defined as the output of a computation based on other states. People generally choose whichever version of the answer is nearest at hand. “Let’s read it from here instead of there because this data source is updated more frequently.” Every read of a state is an estimation process.<br/><br/>So I have a hard time imagining what “collecting state transition logic” could possibly look like. I feel like the scope has to be exceedingly small for that idea to make sense. Even at the app level, you have event loops and synchronization and subsystem boundaries introducing propagation delays that make it difficult to say what a state is. (Race conditions!)<br/><br/>But maybe you just need an exceedingly homogenous programming environment along the lines of Unison to make those big systems seem small? Or Eve-like global synchronization?
