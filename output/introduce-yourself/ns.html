Hi! I see everyone prefers to use their real names here, but I prefer the oldschool approach of staying at least slightly anonymous online. Hope that's fine.<br/>I'm a software architect from Europe, I work on medical systems and SaaS platforms.<br/>Outside that I actively work on problems related to programming languages, language development, code comprehensibility and internalization. I joined this Slack after randomly stumbling upon the FoC podcast, which was very exciting for me right off the bat. Hope to have some discussions with people about new and fresh ideas, and on how to improve/iterate on <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span>â€™s concepts, especially with regards to the "quickly alter the software you're using" idea.
