So CIC rejected my request to host the event (They said they were booked for events, but it sounded like the real issue was I wasn't a CIC member so I couldn't reserve a conference room). I reached out to the Microsoft Garage and The Link coworking spaces but I haven't heard back from them. Does anyone have other suggestions for a space we could meet?
