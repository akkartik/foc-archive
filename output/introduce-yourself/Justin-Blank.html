Hi, I’ve listened to a few episodes of the podcast (found it via the episode with Hillel), and hanging out on the slack for a few weeks. In my day job, I work on an actively developed, but 18 year old (and very creaky) code base of a few million lines, which has helped give me an interest in automated refactoring and static analysis. I have some vague ideas for making those tools easy to write. I also have a project in progress for an IDE facility to fuzz a function and display input-output pairs that exercise different branches: <a href="https://github.com/hyperpape/quicklook">https://github.com/hyperpape/quicklook</a> (that’s just the core fuzzing facility, the IDE integration is a work in progress).
