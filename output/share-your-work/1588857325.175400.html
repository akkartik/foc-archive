So apparently a 9½ minute video is too long for the 2-minute video channel. Who would've thought! This is an introduction to Loyc trees and LES which I've been working on for a few years.<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqm2Eip884E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqm2Eip884E</a>

Given that you normalize all syntax (going by the the <tt>**</tt> vs <tt>^</tt> example), I'm curious how you might encode something like APL, which has a bunch of syntax that doesn't have an analog in other languages.<br/><br/>...or something like the language Whitespace, which ignores all non-whitespace characters and assigns meaning to spaces, tabs, and linefeeds.<br/><br/>...or perhaps a language where the syntax will have different meaning depending on context. For instance, where a construct like <tt>if</tt> can be an expression in some contexts and a statement in others.

It reminded me of the IR of compilers like LLVM.

If you're parsing a language that has features that aren't available in any popular languages, feel free to choose your own representation. I just looked up APL and it appears that many of its features are available in more popular languages, with names that are less terse. No one would be able to guess that<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">(~R∊R∘.×R)/R←1↓ιR</pre><br/>Computes which numbers from 2 to R are prime.<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">X[⍋X+.≠' ';]</pre><br/>Sorts a word list stored in matrix X according to word length.<br/><br/>So I would recommend renaming APL operators internally using names inspired by Python, Julia and MATLAB, but this is just a suggestion; how you use Loyc trees is up to you.<br/><br/>It is expected that some names will have a different meaning depending on context, e.g. most languages have overloaded functions, but it has become clear to me that processing Loyc trees is easier when their meaning is not ambiguous. For example, I now use a different form for "tuples" and "lists of things that are internal to a construct". A tuple is written <tt>(a, b, c)</tt> in LES which means <tt></tt>'tuple<tt>(a, b, c)</tt> while a list internal to a construct is conventionally denoted <tt>#(a, b, c)</tt>, e.g. <tt>#fn(T, Square!T, #(#var(T, x)), x*x)</tt> marks its argument list with <tt>#</tt> and represents the function <tt>T Square&lt;T&gt;(T x) =&gt; x * x</tt>.

Whereas LLVM is semantically well-defined, Loyc trees represent syntax and so have no semantics, although if you follow conventions, Loyc trees represent "approximate" semantics, e.g. <tt>x+2</tt> means "add two to x" which is approximate since it doesn't indicate what <tt>x</tt> refers to, how many bits there are in <tt>2</tt>, or what to do if the addition overflows the size of <tt>x</tt>. By the way, <tt>x</tt> is a <tt>Symbol</tt> object in my implementation and while there is a global symbol called <tt>x</tt> and <tt>'+</tt>, you can also define other symbols called <tt>x</tt> and <tt>'+</tt> so that they could refer to a specific variable and a specific version of the operator. Maybe this says more about <tt>Symbol</tt> than it does about Loyc trees, but I thought I'd mention it because hiding extra information via the symbol object seems useful.

Its always itneresting to me how similar problems seem at a surface level, maybe just related but today I read this: <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/with-category-theory-mathematics-escapes-from-equality-20191010/">https://www.quantamagazine.org/with-category-theory-mathemat&hellip;</a>

the difficulties described in the artical do seem a little related to the rant in this video about the status Quo. At least it feels to me like that
