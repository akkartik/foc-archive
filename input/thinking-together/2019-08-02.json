My hope is for the grounding in geometric transformations to help keep a person keep oriented.  For example, instead of picturing a filter as pulling matching items out of the list, we bring them forward pushing the non-matching items back.  From one point of view, it's the normal, filtered list.  From another, literally from the side, you can see the distribution of matches.  Are they all in the middle?  Periodic?  Erratic?\n\nA call\/return tree is an example of a different kind of fold."

It was a favorite language of the embedded system people (this is Apple II era we are talking), and in those highly memory constrained days, FORTH had an incredible advantage with its microscopic runtime and executable sizes. There was even a word processor written in FORTH that BYTE magazine reviewed highly. But like all write-only languages, it's star dimmed once teams started to try and use it. A single programmer can use any language, but for teams you have to have transferability; and the number of facts one has to memorize to understand a large FORTH program makes it a big challenge. Forth is not only compact but lightning fast. It is among the fastest languages ever made, because when you use the stack like that you are always in cache.  Not all programmers have a photographic memory. I used APL back in the day, and a month later i couldn't read my own code. APL is very dense, and it requires a very strong memory. LISP, APL, FORTH, are all powerful languages, and will always stimulate interest, but when you apply the test of handing a large program with some bugs to fix or improvements to make, to a new programmer they fail that \"mean time to repair by non-author\" test so badly that management is tempted to scrap the codebase and start over. We haven't seen much testing by academics on this critical measurement of a language, and once i get the funding i will perform this test on a variety of languages, and improving this measurement is the main focus of my language research. In their spec sheets disk drives quote a mean time before failure time, for software the mean time to repair is the number that matters for languages, and yet no chart is available showing the measured mean time to repair for transfer of a program. Since software lasts decades, at the end of 25 years, the total money spent on repairs and improvements dwarfs any initial cost, hence the massive resistance in our industry to what are otherwise clearly higher leverage languages who possess a high MTTR score. When one is an indie developer, which i have been much of my career, you have the freedom to pick the highest leverage, most pleasing to your own taste language; in my case i used Modula2 for 20 years to great results. I got a ton of crap from others about it, because it had only a tiny swiss\/german following. But a 2:1 advantage over C which is what Modula-2 has, was definitely worth using.",

Wordstar was written in Assembly language, hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and ran in an astonishing 0.6 megabytes of memory. However nobody could understand or add function to the original code base but the genius author Rob Barnaby. So a team of 12 was assembled. We use the Microsoft C compiler for the project, and after a year of R&amp;D we shipped pretty good product. But it was painful having 12 people on a team; people would change the parameters to functions, and there were lots of pointer-related problems; indirecting through a garbage pointer in C basically randomly overwrites memory, causing super hard to fix bugs. So after that project was over I started a company to make a desktop publishing product similar to InDesign (except running on DOS), and i switched to modula-2. It was immediately apparent that the superior logical design of Modula-2 solved most of C's weaknesses. I went on after that DTP project to make Flying Colors (still runs on Windows after 25 years!) and the Discus labeling program. All written in modula2 which is cross platform with Mac and Windows. In comparing my final product with the many competitors, it is clear that Modula-2 generates executables about half the size of C (not because of compiler tricks but because you get a higher degree of sharing). The ability to separately compile components is superior to C\/C++ even today.\n\nModula2 received a self-inflicted wound when its designer Prof. Wirth created the sequel Oberon, which was not compatible with Modula2 because among other things, for some inexplicable reason, removed enumerated types, making it impossible for his user base to transition gracefully into Oberon. Oberon competed against the OOP paradigm, but without any commercial entity pushing it, C++ and Java took over, and all of Wirth's work is now ignored. He is a really elegant programmer with that Swiss minimalism touch. His book on Algorithms + Data structures = Programs is still a solid book. He is in his 80's now, he is one of the only small teams to make a whole machine + OS from scratch.",

Only one way to do most things, so it falls into regular patterns easily. 2) it concentrated on having very powerful composable yet readable data structure type defns. so you could define an array of pointers that point to a record with a field handler which is a function that returns a string, with a syntax that is lightyears clearer than C. you could compose complex types out of simpler ones.  And when you are running the program, the debugger knows how to present your data. So clean and clear, it makes C look like the near-assembler mess that it is. 3) only Modula2 and Beads to my knowledge compile definition files that are separate from the implementation files; this means that as long as you don't change the interface to a module, you are free to change the code in that module and the calling programs won't be affected. In small scale programs, C header files (.h) don't hurt you much, but when you have 100k lines of code, compiling the C header files is a huge time waster, and much less isolation. Modula2 had a few fancy things like opaque types, where you can define a pointer but don't let people see what is inside. A minor trick but clever.  4) the big win was the massive quantity of runtime checks; every array bounds in both directions is checked, all pointers are validated before use, etc. You can turn off the runtime checks for your golden master version, but during development the extra 30% overhead in code size and perhaps 10% runtime speed loss is a small price to pay for catching errors right at the source. Integer overflows, conversion errors, it does every check you wish C had. It also had the ability to pass records as a constant very efficiently. But keep in mind that Modula-2 was intended for systems programming, and had no drawing functions in the language; on windows you had to use GDI with its clumsy function calls to create windows, select brushes into contexts, etc., so everyone using Modula2 had to build their graphics library routines. Modula2 forces you to be very accurate and precise about the type of things, but it also protects you very strongly. JS and Python are opposite philosophies, very little definition power in those languages. On big projects a tight language is so much more enjoyable, as you are fighting ripple effects more and more the larger the project is, and the sloppy languages make a big project like nailing jello to a tree.",

A minor trick but clever.  4) the big win was the massive quantity of runtime checks; every array bounds in both directions is checked, all pointers are validated before use, etc. You can turn off the runtime checks for your golden master version, but during development the extra 30% overhead in code size and perhaps 10% runtime speed loss is a small price to pay for catching errors right at the source. Integer overflows, conversion errors, it does every check you wish C had. It also had the ability to pass records as a constant very efficiently. But keep in mind that Modula-2 was intended for systems programming, and had no drawing functions in the language; on windows you had to use GDI with its clumsy function calls to create windows, select brushes into contexts, etc., so everyone using Modula2 had to build their graphics library routines. Modula2 forces you to be very accurate and precise about the type of things, but it also protects you very strongly. JS and Python are opposite philosophies, very little definition power in those languages. On big projects a tight language is so much more enjoyable, as you are fighting ripple effects more and more the larger the project is, and the sloppy languages make a big project like nailing jello to a tree."
