Hi all! I'm <a href="https://marci.gunyho.com">Márton</a>, but I usually go by the nickname Marci. I'm in Finland, currently finishing up my PhD related to superconducting quantum computing.<br/><br/>I learned to program fairly late, only during my physics studies in uni. Turns out that I love it, and I'm sure I could have learned it much earlier if it wasn't so hard to get started. So the FoC goal of making programming more accessible strongly resonates with me.<br/><br/>I like to learn new programming languages, I've done Advent of Code with Racket, BQN (a modern variant of APL) and most recently with Pharo Smalltalk (it was great!). Another FoC-adjacent thing I like to do is making experimental-ish electronic music - I've dabbled in PureData and Supercollider, and also played around quite a bit with VCV Rack. I also sometimes like to do graphics programming (Processing and some GLSL), and I've been involved in the demoscene in Helsinki a little bit. And I of course love video games, I would like to find enough time some day to make my own.<br/><br/>I think I was primed for FoC ideas by noticing the awful state of most of the software I see around me, especially during my PhD studies working with lab control electronics and doing science in general. At some point I came across Bret Victor's talks on HN, and I was immediately hooked. After that I've been continuously absorbing related material like Ink &amp; Switch, the local-first movement etc. After a while, I came across the podcast, and I was struck by how great it is. It has so many things I like - the interesting topics, fun banter, and the weird musical interludes and the overall off-beat format. I love it.<br/><br/>I'm excited to see what's going on in this forum!
