What <tt>ideal</tt> tools would you like to have in every project you work on?<br/><br/>My list:<br/>• Graph db - I’m fed up with Relational dbs and Mongo like key value stores. (OpenCypher as query language would be really nice :smile: ) - offline-first support<br/>• Same language both for server and client (like typescript)<br/>• Static typing (I’d prefer Dependent Types like Idris, but the ecosystem is just not that mature)<br/>• Actor model, visualisation: like XState<br/>• Over The Air update support (for mobile apps)<br/>• Visual (Snapshot) Testing (like <a href="http://percy.io">percy.io</a>)<br/>• support for Property based testing &amp; random tests<br/>

this depends on the problem that I want to solve. creating a landing page is very different to creating a web search engine.  ....  I.e. the solution depends on the problem.  ... read books like the mom test or Microsoft secrets to understand why problem first way of thinking tends to work better than tech first.

For web apps I'm frustrated that the famed starting ToDo App isn't more finished. To me, it feels like in 2020 I should be able to clone a repo and get<br/><br/>• a client side starting front end<br/>• a mobile client (I'm happy with webview based but migth be okay with other solutions as long as they're portable)<br/>• a service side starting back end with db, backup, search<br/>• a testing infrustructure for both front and backend with tests already imlpemented for the todo app as examples<br/>• logging and analytics build in to both sides<br/>• simple CI intgrations (like as simple as tell it your CI, give it credentials, done)<br/>• staging and production ready to go<br/>• a/b testing infrastructure <br/>• rolling updates<br/>• scalable out of the box. Just tell it how many servers you need<br/>• a pony!<br/>There's more.<br/><br/>• I'd prefer it already support browser friendly app state like gmail, google maps where most user inputs that change the display get reflected in the url so back takes you back to where you where<br/>I know my list is probably missing 30 things I'm forgetting but it's so frustrating to know that if I start a webapp from scratch today I have man years of work until I get all of those things integrated and because I haven't done each of them 50 times I'll get them wrong and full of bugs and security holes.<br/><br/>Arguably most web apps need those features and everyone is remaking them every time.<br/><br/>Or I'm just out of the loop and haven't seen the solutions.
