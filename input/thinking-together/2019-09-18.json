I want to make the design holistic by implementing Hest in terms of itself — to go metacircular \/ bootstrapped right from the get-go — but that's kicking my ass raw. The alternative, where I make a partial design that has concessions to the existing ways (like bottoming-out in text), and then iteratively broaden that design, saving self-hosting for the distant future, might be the only way I can make progress. Ultimately I'm not just making concessions to the built world around me, I'm making concessions to my own limited ability. That stings.\n\nOne wonders: Is it not sufficient to reinvent something bit by bit? Does it need to be a total design from the outset?\n\nI take your joke. It's funny! But if you meant it as a slight, that's a bit tough for folks like me who are struggling with the burden of the tech world we were born into.",

I want to make the design holistic by implementing Hest in terms of itself — to go metacircular \/ bootstrapped right from the get-go — but that's kicking my ass raw. The alternative, where I make a partial design that has concessions to the existing ways (like bottoming-out in text), and then iteratively broaden that design, saving self-hosting for the distant future, might be the only way I can make progress. Ultimately I'm not just making concessions to the built world around me, I'm making concessions to my own limited ability. That stings.\n\nOne wonders: Is it not sufficient to reinvent something bit by bit? Does it need to be a total design from the outset?\n\nI take your joke. It's funny! But if you meant it as a slight, that's a bit tough for folks like me who are struggling with the burden of the tech world we were born into."

        "text": "In my project, the overall goal is to produce a notation that is so compact and precise, that it is shorter than the conventional product specification documents, and thus can be the specification and implementation in one.  Certainly in smaller projects it holds true, and we'll see how close it gets on larger projects. Classical UML, and formal system design processes are not practical because you can't execute UML, so you end up with an implementation phase than then needs to be checked against a changing specification document; chaos ensues. Having the spec and the program be one thing should be grasped as a big win.",

Certainly in smaller projects it holds true, and we'll see how close it gets on larger projects. Classical UML, and formal system design processes are not practical because you can't execute UML, so you end up with an implementation phase than then needs to be checked against a changing specification document; chaos ensues. Having the spec and the program be one thing should be grasped as a big win."
