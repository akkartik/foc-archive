Hey <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Corey Montella</span>. Read your posts and watched the demo. Very nice and quite impressive.<br/>I'm a big fan of Eve as well and got a lot of inspiration from it.<br/>Funny story: just an hour before you joined this channel on Wednesday, I gave a presentation of my project to the research group here in Potsdam and somebody said that my demo reminded him of one he saw recently but couldn't remember the name. Turns out he was talking about Mech!<br/>The reason he was reminded of it was that he didn't understand what problem I'm trying to solve and he had the same feeling when he watched your demo. I thought that's a very interesting sentiment. You said you're targeting "for very small values of 'use'". What could these values be? Do you have a specific use case / target group in mind that you're aiming for? How would you answer the question "What problem are you trying to solve?"

Hey Nikolas, I would love to see any links you have on the research you presented.<br/><br/>I don't know if I should feel good that someone across the world heard on my project, or horrified that they found it memorable only because they couldn’t see the point :stuck_out_tongue:<br/><br/>I’m designing Mech to be at the center of a nonprofit I’m in the process of forming that will teach 21st century problem solving skills to middle and high school students. There are many programs today focused on teaching kids how to code, but I find that a great deal of these programs place a heavy focus on teaching specific language mechanics, while some students are not able to even formulate their problem in a way they could express in the language. I think that problem solving and critical thinking are not taught in schools today, so before we rush to teach kids how to write software and apps and websites, we first need to teach them what abstraction is and how it’s useful, how to do things like decompose a large problem into smaller parts, and how to marshal a wide variety of tools (including programming languages) to solve each part.<br/><br/>I've found some success myself running a curriculum with MATLAB and iRobot creates. I had 11-12 year olds who never really used computers before (came from underserved communities) writing pretty impressive programs for the creates, and I attribute that to MATLAB's REPL and the uniform array representation. They had a very tight development loop and could experiment freely, as well as not worry about types and data structures and other things. By the end of the few days they basically knew all of MATLAB (arrays, function, loops, conditionals... that's about it.), and could write simple maze following controllers for robots among other things.<br/><br/>That’s where Mech comes in. I’d like to use Mech as the platform in place of MATLAB because I think the collection of features I can cook up will better serve the interests of the students. They will also be able to use it from home for free, and even if they don’t go on to do any programming at all in the future, it is my goal they would at least understand to use Mech or even similar tools like Excel or SQL to leverage the vast array of information processing capabilities available to us.<br/><br/>&gt; You said you're targeting "for very small values of 'use'". What could these values be?<br/><br/>Yeah, what I meant specifically by that was my first milestone is to have Mech act as a remote procedure call destination. Basically, it will sit on a WebSocket and accept queries and send back a response based on that. I think that’s about the minimally useful thing it could be. I’ll figure out where to go from there, because I’m almost at that point I think.

Oh yeah I didn't link to my project. It's <a href="http://zells.org">zells.org</a><br/>It's not really "research" (yet), more a "let's build something and see how it goes". I guess people are naturally suspicious about any project that aims to "make programming easier", because it's tricky to prove it and I haven't seen any project that really supported such claims with evidence. And it's especially difficult to extrapolate from early demos, don't you think?<br/><br/>I must confess that after watching your demo I myself was wondering where you're going with this, but looking at it from a "this is to teach problem solving skills to young students in place of MATLAB" perspective, it absolutely makes sense to me. Did you consider putting that goal into the intro on <a href="http://mechlang.net">mechlang.net</a> (which works now for me, btw)? Writing this I realized I should probably try out to describe my own project from a value-oriented perspective myself. But first I would have to find a value.<br/><br/>Hey would you have time for a call? I'm very interested in your plans for running the nonprofit. To me it seems that funding it still a very tricky thing for this kind of projects. And it that regard I'd also be very interested to hear about your experience with Eve if you're not tired of talking about it :smiley:

Cool yeah, I've actually looked at this before. I think I saw it on HN or something. I think you’ve put some good ideas in Zells!<br/>I started implementing Mech only a few months ago, and the idea for the nonprofit is still nascent as well. The paragraph I typed above is literally the first time I’ve put the concept into words, so that gives  you an idea how far along these ideas are :stuck_out_tongue: But I’m trying to get them out there early and see if anything resonates, so I’m glad you like the sound of a nonprofit, and I would definitely talk more with you about those topic. Drop me an email at <a href="mailto:corey@mech-lang.org">corey@mech-lang.org</a>
