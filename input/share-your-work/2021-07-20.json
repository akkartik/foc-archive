All of these projects superficially appear to be graphics editors, but by interacting with them you actually create _a program_ that generates graphics. Their interfaces are wildly different from both traditional programming tools and traditional graphics apps. If you are not familiar with these projects, I strongly recommend that you actually go and play them (they all run in the browser), or watch the <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=i3Xack9ufYk|Strange Loop talk> where Toby demos Apparatus and explains the thinking behind it.\n\n(And if Toby's work still doesn't ring any bells — he was also at Dynamicland, and CDG before that. Heavy hitter!)\n\nThis episode was sponsored by <https:\/\/www.glideapps.com\/|Glide>, and the transcript was sponsored by <https:\/\/replit.com\/|Replit> — thanks to them both for making this possible!\n\nThe show notes and transcript are available right here: <https:\/\/futureofcoding.org\/episodes\/051>\n\nMeta-commentary in the thread.",
