I just came across another dead body in graveyard of new languages; called SKIP, developed at facebook by a formidable team from 2015 to 2018. It is reported as being carried on by its main designer Julien Verlaguet. I haven't had a chance to review it yet to see what it added to the mix, but it was another substantial effort like Eve, and anyone working on their own project, should at least glance over and see what happened to other teams. Facebook is notoriously fickle about projects and products; they are a dictatorship, and subject to whims of the management.

Skip has a few unusual aspects. For one, the editor lets you see not only the parse tree, but the AST. Not many languages let you see this. It also is evidently a transpiler to JS as well as a compiled language. That must have been a lot of work to reconcile those two universes (presuming they use LLVM or something to emit machine code). This was obviously a huge project, representing millions in R&amp;D dollars. From first glance they embraced OOP as a paradigm, and that might have been one of their downfalls.

But commercial success or failure does not always mean the product was good or bad. There are many bad things that became popular, like COBOL, and many good things like the Pierce-Arrow car or Modula-2 that never caught on. So i am not casting shade on the Skip project which i spent 10 minutes studying.
