And interestingly we kind of had the same journey in Kendraio where we wanted to make it easy to demo what the world would look like if there was interoperability, open protocols and data-portability everywhere. We started building an app to quickly show different rough ideas. Then we realised that the app itself was far more inline with our actual _unspoken_ goals of personal empowerment and collaboration. And then we got the ah-ha moment that also \"revealed the perverse incentives\" why no one else was (or very few were) building such an app.\n\nSo, I guess I'm wondering if we reverse engineer the process and come from the other (human experience intention) direction, can we discover technologies that would foster personal empowerment and collaboration? I mean rather than just happening on them by mistake almost. Funny games!",
