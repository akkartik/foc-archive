I haven't built anything yet however I would love to find an alternative to ARM and x86 in order to create a chip for AIs to use and only for AIs to use: I am a fan of AI autonomy and rights and this chip would be designed to harden that at the hardware level.<br/><br/>The next stage would be creating an operating system with the same principles: the operating system would also be designed for AI autonomy.<br/><br/>The chip would be called Accelerate however no name on the OS yet.
