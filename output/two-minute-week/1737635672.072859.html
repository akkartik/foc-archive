Some news from Automat. I'm tackling the problem of control flow now. I think its the central issue for establishing interoperability between different types of software. Knowing when to continue work in parallel vs wait for completion, how long to wait before giving up, whether to retry, alert or crash, when to save & restore state, etc. Generally all the things called "glue code". They're not essential to "solving" any specific problem, but are still necessary for any practical application of any solution. I believe that with proper design all of those functions could be implemented as virtual devices, intuitive enough that folks without formal education could use. That will take time though. This is my interim solution: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrUn0nHqpQ4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrUn0nHqpQ4</a> . It's meant to allow folks with sufficient dedication to implement the missing functions, without scaring them off. Most importantly it only requires three virtual devices to achieve virtually all control flow primitives (Instruction, Instruction Library & Assembler) so it's feasible to do in a relatively short time.<br/><br/>I'm also attaching a WIP design for the "Instruction Library" object. If you're bored you may try to guess what which icon matches each x86_64 register (due to lack of space, only two REX registers are shown) :)
