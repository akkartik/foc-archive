Perhaps a different kind of UX to deeply interact with difficult words on paper? LLMs can create a tree of concepts, so for difficult words (e.g. homotopy), selecting them would display a tree of related concepts (like homeomorphism), right within the PDFs. Other good ideas <https:\/\/maggieappleton.com\/lm-sketchbook|here> and <https:\/\/www.noya.io\/|here>.\n\nVR: Ideas as physical objects?
