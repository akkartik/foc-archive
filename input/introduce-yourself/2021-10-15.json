Particularly incentivizing people (today's \"end users\") to think harder about their decisions around computers. Because decisions on computers have huge <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nonlinear_system|non-linear> effects. Most people don't _get_ the benefits of a computer as a tool for thought. They mostly care about whether it plays Netflix or Fortnite. It steals my location but hey the pixels _look_ great. I'm culpable here as well. And if end users are susceptible to short-sighted decisions that affect them directly, that creates much stronger incentives for products and companies to serve them in short-sighted ways that gradually grow exploitative. (It's worth considering government regulation to compensate for end-user decisions, but that's still difficult and also introduces more noise, because bureaucracies now have <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Regulatory_capture|new incentives> to operate in their interest rather than end users.)\n• As a corollary, if you want to build tools but also have them be hugely popular, you're going to fall into many of the same traps of incentives as everyone else before you. (On the other hand I went <https:\/\/github.com\/akkartik\/mu|a different way> and got zero adoption, which doesn't help either. I'm still reflecting on this.)\n• You can't improve human computer interfaces in isolation. The surgery has to go deeper, into what we colloquially call the backend or the OS. A lot of the projects here aren't concerned with giving people a \"business as usual\" experience. They're slightly uncomfortable, need work to learn. And that seems like a good thing. The trick is requiring some learning but not too much, that's where we all seem to fail at the moment.\n• Check out <http:\/\/akkartik.name\/illich.pdf|Ivan Illich, \"Tools for conviviality\"> (1973)",
