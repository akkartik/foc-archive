I wanted to give the kids a Paint program, so I did a quick Google in my current favorite framework and found <https:\/\/love2d.org\/forums\/viewtopic.php?t=87469>. Ran great and was loads of fun, but looked a bit.. off. Some of the colors were missing, and clicking on the black rectangles sometimes abruptly changed the color. Turns out: \"In versions prior to 11.0, color component values were within the range of 0 to 255 instead of 0 to 1.\" (<https:\/\/love2d.org\/wiki\/love.graphics.setColor>)",

Conway's law explains how this affects the code structure. There are two situations in which you can use Jupyter productively: as an \"end user\" with a profile closely corresponding to the Jupyter team's target profile, or as a tool developer integrated with the Jupyter community. Jupyter is hackable only for the second category."
