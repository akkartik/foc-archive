I’ve been really into probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) lately. I had a few “aha” moments and I’m decidedly in the “hit everything with this hammer to figure out where the nails are” phase.<br/><br/>Anyway, is anybody here in a similar headspace? Or already experienced with PPLs?<br/><br/>Is anybody curious to enter this headspace with me? I reviewed the (online, free, programmable) book that brought me here: <a href="https://micro.alltom.com/2024/01/11/the-cognition-in.html">https://micro.alltom.com/2024/01/11/the-cognition-in.html</a>

Here's an angle: a few weeks playing in this <em>surprisingly visual</em> language made years of reading about conditional probabilities finally click. I'm starting to feel like WebPPL is the language that we ought to teach probability with.<br/><br/>While it's not a game, I find myself tweaking models just to see how it changes the generated charts. A WebPPL workflow is describing a probabilistic model (like "I deal five cards and have two pair") and returning values of interest (like "whether the next deal has three-of-a-kind"), which the system infers the likelihood of, and then presents using what it thinks are the best charts to suit the data. Its output is always a chart. Showering myself in random samples is more visceral, but seeing these plots was a rung on the ladder of abstraction that wasn't available to me before because the algebra made it so inaccessible.<br/><br/>I've started to use WebPPL to interrogate my own cognition. The other day I asked whether my idea of "healthy" is just a function of how many calories is in a serving of food. I asked by comparing that to a model that just picked randomly—turns out my theory was wrong, because the random model matched my tiny dataset better. Took me a couple of minutes. I don't even know how I would have posed that question before!<br/><br/>I want to start using it in my art. Like, it's easy to explore the parameters of an L-system by changing the parameters, but I could work backwards by drawing an example of what I want, and getting a probability <em>distribution</em> of parameters that could have generated it. It's a type of machine learning that feels far more human-scale, and more interesting than throwing gradient descent at classification and regression tasks.<br/><br/>The physicality of generative modeling, and of the related inference algorithms, are <em>begging</em> to be embedding in a Hest-like interface!<br/><br/>Anyway, I hope to be back with more later, hopefully in #devlog-together. :)

I work on data tools and webppl is new to me! What’s your sense for the goals of this language?

I don’t <b>really</b> know, but I get the sense that it’s half whatever they need for their active research, and half pedagogical for the people teaching classes with it. It doesn’t have the data-ingestion infrastructure or performance or repo activity for me to believe that it’s used in production systems.
