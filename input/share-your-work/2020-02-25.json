Because he did not know how assess the value add of an idea. Also Microsoft had similar problems in the 1990's. People have learned from these failures, and there are now better processes that help with idea validation.\n\nThe main idea is to measure the value add of an idea. These 3 books do this in slightly different ways, but they all assess the \"value add\" by comparing to the current solution. You take the current solution and use that to evaluate new ideas.\n\nSome people call the current solution \"As Is\" and the proposed solution \"To Be\".\n\n- Microsoft secrets - It covers many topics and has a chapter or two on idea validation and product road map processes. Some of the product road map processes are aimed at improving existing solutions and large budget project. That said the core lesson is more or less the same.\n\n- Rob Fitzpatrick - book \"The Mom Test\". Video of him talking about the problem and solution. He describes how to create \"as is\" user stories so developers can design good \"to be\" stories. Watch how he picks features. (45 Min) <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0LwbFZkyRKk>\n\n- Clayton Christensen - Competing Against Luck: The Story of Innovation and Customer Choice - is related, the book review I have seen suggest his process is mostly the same, but I have not read it.\n\nFocus groups\/user testing\/UX - as described by <@UEQ6M68H0> above is also discussed in Microsoft secrets. - In my view, value add and ease of use are not the same. For example, word processors have become easy to use, you don't need an instruction manual or training course these days, but I remember word perfect and having to memorise key combinations for bold and centre etc.   ....  With the problem of value add, you can create a reasonable estimate of the value add of a new feature idea long before you write any code. The 3 books describe ways to do this.\n\nExcel story ... \"Over the next two weeks we visited dozens of Excel customers, and did not see anyone using Excel to actually perform what you would call “calculations.” Almost all of them were using Excel because it was a convenient way to create a table.\"\nFrom  <https:\/\/www.joelonsoftware.com\/2012\/01\/06\/how-trello-is-different\/>",

Because he did not know how assess the value add of an idea. Also Microsoft had similar problems in the 1990's. People have learned from these failures, and there are now better processes that help with idea validation.\n\nThe main idea is to measure the value add of an idea. These 3 books do this in slightly different ways, but they all assess the \"value add\" by comparing to the current solution. You take the current solution and use that to evaluate new ideas.\n\nSome people call the current solution \"As Is\" and the proposed solution \"To Be\".\n\n- Microsoft secrets - It covers many topics and has a chapter or two on idea validation and product road map processes. Some of the product road map processes are aimed at improving existing solutions and large budget project. That said the core lesson is more or less the same.\n\n- Rob Fitzpatrick - book \"The Mom Test\". Video of him talking about the problem and solution. He describes how to create \"as is\" user stories so developers can design good \"to be\" stories. Watch how he picks features. (45 Min) "

With the problem of value add, you can create a reasonable estimate of the value add of a new feature idea long before you write any code. The 3 books describe ways to do this.\n\nExcel story ... \"Over the next two weeks we visited dozens of Excel customers, and did not see anyone using Excel to actually perform what you would call “calculations.” Almost all of them were using Excel because it was a convenient way to create a table.\"\nFrom  "
