Hi everyone! I'm Josh Sunshine, an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. I lead the <a href="https://penrose.cs.cmu.edu/">Penrose</a> team. Penrose is a  platform for conceptual diagramming. In Penrose, you declare what you want to be true of your diagram and Penrose automatically lays out your diagram to meet your goals. Under the hood, we use some interesting differentiable geometry, numeric optimization, and compiler tricks to make it work.<br/>I'm broadly interested in research at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and programming languages (PL). That intersection seems closely connected to this group. I also run an annual research workshop called <a href="https://2025.plateau-workshop.org/">PLATEAU</a> that focuses on PL+HCI which may interest some of you.
