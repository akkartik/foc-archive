Yeah, at the end of the day this is about specification and what level you allow behavior to emerge. Tax systems are a fascinating thing to look at to study this. Most people think taxes are ridiculously over-complicated (and they are), but try designing a system that is reasonable at all levels of "execution"... the possible space of behaviors is functionally infinite, by bounding it you are necessarily going to end up being overly reductionist (so simple as to no longer be sensible) or so complex that it's hard to understand what the system does anymore.
