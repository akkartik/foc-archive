# Status<br/>• of interest: this is all fast enough to look like a REPL, although it spawns several heavy-weight processes and uses a local browser and websockets<br/>• das2json is now written in javascript (formerly only Odin)<br/>• das2json is a small program which converts a .drawio file into JSON<br/>• this means that drawings can be reduced to JSON, a format which can be manipulated by just about any programming language<br/>• VHLL language: <br/>• got "RT" ("recursive text") compiler (transpiler) to run, at least for Python, and to self-compile <br/>• RT is a VHLL that uses Python, Javascript and Common Lisp as "assemblers"<br/>• <tt>rt</tt> pushed to <a href="https://github.com/guitarvydas/rt/tree/main">repo</a><br/>• next: test Javascript and Common Lisp self-compilation<br/>• next-next: create a local copy of <tt>t2t</tt>so that the whole thing resides in one repo<br/>• next-next-next: implement Larson Scanner in Javascript in a browser<br/>• README.md expanded to include some discussion of the mechanics of this stuff.
