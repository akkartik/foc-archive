One high level goal might be (at least for me): democratization of the act of programming. Which means first define what is the essence of the act of programming. Remove all accidental complexity in programming as we do it now to keep only the essential complexity. Then build something on this basis with a focus on the programming experience. Then (and only then) see how the act programming as it is done now can practically fit in the new vision. This last one is because we can't throw away everything that is practically in use, just because of a new "better" way to do things. And also because we can include the old way in the new way, as the new vision of the act of programming will be a kind of a subset (the essence) of the old one.
