Hi everyone, my name is Fred, I'm 24 and live in the uk.<br/><br/>I've spent the last year obsessively thinking about some crazy idea I had, of representing an application as a graph data structure, in which everything (ui, logic, state, assets, everything) can be boiled down to edges and vertices. I thought this was the basis to do so many interesting things like code generators, low-code type tool, and even the theory behind it. <br/><br/>I never knew that there was a whole active community behind a lot of the ideas I've been thinking about. This has blown me away, made my entire day, even. I've never spoken about this type of stuff to anyone because I never thought anyone would even care, but to see that I was completely wrong is awesome!<br/><br/>Honestly, I haven't worked on my project for ages, after being busied by personal issues, but the past few days going through all the work and information from this community really revitalised something. All of a sudden, it's all I can think about again.<br/><br/>I don't have anything to show yet, but hopefully I'll share progress with you guys soon. I don't really know what else to say in this post, so I'll leave it at that :woman-shrugging:<br/><br/>Good day
