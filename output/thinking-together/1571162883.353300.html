Secondly, it’s not clear who is responsible, what is the code of conduct, who are moderators, how to get involved, who is involved, etc... I can only deduce this by looking at who is most active? I don’t mean this to sound brass or rude, just asking serious questions about what’s going on in this adhoc Slack channel. I would be honored to help bring structure, or at the least suggest some. If <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> is indeed raising $20M than these principles and policies should be well documented and visible, you agree?

Not much structure; it's an open forum. If you have a question, ask; if you have something to say, jump in!<br/><br/>No need for moderators. So far everyone seems to implicitly understand "don't be a jerk".<br/><br/>Agree that the funding will need structure. It seems at this point that structure is not at all decided yet— all that's been announced is Steve's intent to seek funding. What form that takes will probably be up to Steve and the investors/donors.

I will say that an implicit policy of "don't be a jerk" can work well with an initial small similar minded group, but fails to scale really quickly. That can be figured out when we get there, or we could proactively adopt one of the many great code of conduct examples out there.
