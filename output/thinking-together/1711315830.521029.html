Pondering some FoC-adjacent ideas, with the goal of finding a financially sustainable project that can fund more tentative adjacent work - <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/miscellaneous-ideas">https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/miscellaneous-ideas</a> / <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/how-to-trade-software-for-small-money/">https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/how-to-trade-soft&hellip;</a>.<br/><br/>Less FoC-related, I mentioned in the bottom of that post that I'd love to help someone pick up the streaming system testing work that I started in <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/internal-consistency-in-streaming-systems/">https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/internal-consiste&hellip;</a>. It will be a real slog getting momentum, but there's potential to really raise the (incredibly low) bar for reliability and understand-ability in that niche.
