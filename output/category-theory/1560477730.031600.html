<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Daniel Hines</span> I usually cut people slack when they dive off the deep end.  Non-philosophers tend to be a little bit loose with notions, so more nice to choose the favorable interpretation of what people say.  (The alternative is what you get at a Philosophy conference where most people will literally read an abridged version of their paper so as to avoid saying anything embarrassing.)  I will agree though that reduction to neuroscience is irritating.  I mean really?  Is there something about this that is specific to speech or vision or social relationships?  Lots of things are – don't get wrong – but categories?  Objects and arrows with composition: there isn't much there there to be specific to humans.

Isn’t it obvious, though? The arrows represent our primal hunting instinct, complete with barbs and such. The objects are mammoths… :face_with_rolling_eyes:

When someone is snarky about the things that make us human, I have no qualms being snarky right back. At the risk of sounding utilitarian, I assert that if we tear down the belief in true knowledge of anything outside our selves, we’ll torn down human society and happiness with it.
