I think you need to put a little more effort into EBNF grammar, and explain what the notation #ball = [|x y vx vy| xx xx vx vy] means. When one encounters a new language, you fall back to the syntax one is most familiar with like Java or in my case C or Modula-2. The brackets means subscript, and the vertical bar is logical OR in C. You are defining some ball entity which does something. Anyway i tried the program and it drew 5 dots, but i had no idea why.",
