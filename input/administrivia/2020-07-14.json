It is an observable fact that women are somewhat more interested in people than things, and men are more interested in things than people, and when you consider the tail of the bell shaped curve,  even if the median of men's interest in things is only 10% more than the average woman's, when you go out 5 standard deviations at the tail end to the region called \"super highly interested in things\", which is where programmers are, you will see that the tail is going to be 90% men. This is simple gaussian curve statistics. This is not going to be fixed by any word policing or wishing it was otherwise.\n\nThe fact is that women are not choosing the field of programming, and for sure are not choosing to participate in this forum which is about the futuristic edge of programming as a field; that's what I call \"pure thingness\". Even in countries that have spent decades equalizing roles between men and women, men and women still show marked preferences for occupations. When i started in computers there were a fair number of women programmers, because it was considered clerical, and women were known to be more precise at repetitive and clerical tasks. The percentage of women went down as it became more competitive and lucrative.  Virtue signaling is an empty gesture. What is going to attract more people - women included - is to have high quality, relevant content to the subject of future computing.\n\nThe majority of new programmers are from India, China and other parts of Asia. I would estimate 100 million people are learning programming now, most of them outside the USA. Most of these young kids are lusting after working at one of the big firms, so they only want to know what Google, Apple, etc., are up to, and are unfortunately uninterested in the future of programming. I find more senior people on this group than college students, which was the opposite when i was in college; we were enthralled with the latest and greatest.",
