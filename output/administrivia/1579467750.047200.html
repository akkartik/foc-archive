Starting a new thread (about partly compensating me for my work on the Podcast and administrating the community). Read on and weigh-in if you have thoughts about how/if something like a Patreon or OpenCollective would be [in]appropriate.<br/><br/>Prompted by: <a href="1579230022.005300.html#1579467426.046800">1.579467.html&hellip;</a>

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Dekorte</span> Yes, I have thought about that. I like a few things about it. For instance, it'd let me record longer interviews (which I like doing) and yet keep the main "public" feed episodes to a reasonable length.

There are some podcasts that make this work really well. Others that don't. I haven't been able to synthesize my feelings about this idea into a coherent plan, but it's something I'd definitely consider.

I’ve wanted to become a Patreon subscriber to several podcasts, but they ask for more than I value them. I get that these things take time, but to charge roughly as much as Apple Music or Netflix seems high.

I also worry about recurring subscriptions that I forget about, but would happily click an iTunes podcast buy episode button for $1 or so if the 1st part was of interest.

Would you back something that doesn't offer a reward? I've seen some folks pitch it as "You're paying because you want <em>everyone</em> to have this, not because you want something extra for yourself."

Less likely unless I felt I wouldn’t be able to give more to charity in the long run because my investments have reached a point where they have a lower rate of return than the giving would have in positive return over the same period. Does that make sense?

That makes sense if you think of it as "charity". But I think you might be fairly unique in seeing Patreon through that lens. Hard for me to say — the Patreons I support are done with the primary aim of supporting someone whose work I appreciate, so that they can continue producing the work. I don't think about it much more deeply than that. I certainly don't compare the value I receive from their work to the value I receive from, say, Netflix, since they're serving wildly different aspects of my quality of life.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Flipping the question around... Here are my "FoC Patreon" options, as I see them, based on the facts on the ground (like the amount Steve was making from his Patreon for FoC before he retired, and the current sorts of work I can do for the community).<br/><br/>1) I reward backers with <em>something new</em>, on top of the things I'm already doing — like a new kind of podcast, or a video series. That means the money earned from Patreon has to cover the cost and effort of all the things I'm already doing <em>plus</em> this new thing. Given that Steve's Patreon was bringing in about $250/month (before fees, expenses, etc), and assuming a new FoC Patreon would bring in a similar amount, it's hard to argue that this is worth doing — I'd just be pushing myself deeper into the red.<br/><br/>2) I take something I'm already doing and move it behind the paywall. That means people in the community are worse off than if I hadn't started a Patreon, except for those who are willing to pay (which will almost certainly be a small minority of people here). And those people who do pay are now paying for something they used to get for free, and that's usually a sour proposition.<br/><br/>3) I keep doing all the things I'm currently doing, for all the current audiences, and ask people to support me because they want me to keep doing these things. Nobody in the community is any worse off for not paying, I don't need to take on yet another ongoing responsibility, and I receive a token compensation for the hours spent doing the podcast, administration, promotion, etc. from the folks who see that as something worth supporting.<br/><br/>Given the small amount of money on the table, #1 seems unsustainable, #2 seems punitive, and only #3 seems reasonable. What do you think? What am I missing? What other options are there?

FWIW, I donate to the Patreon accounts of a bunch of people based on the fact that I regularly consume their work, and I want to give back. I'm not motivated by Patreon "rewards", and the amounts I donate are not aligned with reward levels. This makes me wonder what percentage of FoC type people would not contribute if there were no rewards. You could run a survey on this slack. Will you consider donating to Ivan's Patreon to help fund this community? If there are rewards, will this affect your decision to contribute?<br/><br/>My own attitudes towards the Patreon reward system are probably conditioned by the norms of the open source movement. Maybe that's also true for a lot of other people in this community. I just dump my own work onto a public github repository without attempting to monetize it, just like all of the upstream projects I depend on. I don't have a Patreon fund, and if I did I would not want to spend much time managing it.

Just chiming in as a lurker, echoing what others are saying: I give $2 an episode to two different data-related podcasts, and $2 more towards the mastodon instance. I do it to acknowledge the effort put into building community and making a thing I like. It definitely isn't about getting bonus content (I think one releases outtakes that aren't distributed through the main podcast feed...I've never listened).  I'm usually more interested in overpaying for a laptop sticker.<br/><br/>Speaking for myself, the thing that would motivate me to donate (and again we're talking about $2/per, which is not very much) would be "more patreon money =&gt; more podcast eps for everyone".
