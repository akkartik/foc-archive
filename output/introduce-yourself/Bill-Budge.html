Hi, I'm Bill, and I have been following this group for a while now.<br/><br/>I began programming as a teenager back in the 1970's (first language Autocoder assembly on an IBM 1401 computer.)<br/><br/>I got an Apple II computer in 1979, which led to me dropping out of graduate school and becoming a game programmer. I wrote Pinball Construction Set, probably my main claim to fame. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_Construction_Set">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_Construction_Set</a><br/><br/>After that I had a long career as a programmer working at Apple Computer, Electronic Arts, The 3DO Company, Sony Computer Entertainment, and finally at Google, where I worked on Chrome, Native Client, WebAssembly, and the V8 Javascript compiler and runtime.<br/><br/>I have been interested in building editor-like tools for constructing programs for a long time. Pinball Construction Set allowed users to build their own video pinball games. At Sony, I worked on a set of libraries for building editors which was widely used internally and eventually open-sourced: <a href="https://github.com/SonyWWS/ATF">https://github.com/SonyWWS/ATF</a>. One tool was a node-and-wire realtime procedural audio library, another a Statechart editor.<br/><br/>For the last 10 years I have been working on an editor for diagramming software, using "nodes and wires", but adopting some of the ideas behind Harel Statecharts. I will share this work on that thread.
