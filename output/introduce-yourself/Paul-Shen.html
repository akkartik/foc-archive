Hi! My name's Paul and I love the prompt "future of coding". In the past, I've worked at Facebook and led product infrastructure at Discord. I actually left my job to explore ideas in programming/tools/education and learn more about PL and other things.<br/><br/>Being interested in code/design led me towards frontend/product engineering. Having spent some time here, I feel the tools and levels of abstractions are great but have so much more potential. I'm excited for a day styling (css, etc) is mostly handled in the design tool. Working with code as text files seems primitive. I have many more thoughts and questions :stuck_out_tongue:<br/><br/>Some links: <a href="https://blog.discord.com/discord-react-memory-leak-565c89763e8">Investigating React memory leak at Discord</a>, <a href="https://bypaulshen.com/posts/monads-for-javascript-developers/">Monad tutorial for JS devs</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_paulshen/status/1304855130748063744">Visualizing array.splice</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_paulshen">twitter @_paulshen</a><br/>Excited to be here!
