Thank you for the rec.\n• CSS: I'm using features like rule nesting and custom properties, which make it faster to iterate on the design. Once the dust has settled, I can spend a few cycles making sure everything degrades gracefully — this adds bulk and cyclomatic complexity, so it's actually against the spirit of simplicity and minimalism, but it's worth doing to give as many folks as possible a nice experience.\n• I'm going to say that a search engine that's somehow specific to this wiki is out of scope for now. We could add, say, a search box that just drops the user on duck duck go with a `site:` query, maybe. But especially when the quantity of text on the site is relatively small, search is going to be a bit shot-in-the-dark. Good to think about for down the road, sure.\n• Yeah! The thing I'm setting up is (A) a git repo with all the wiki entries as either html files or some sort of md-like plain text files, (B) a build script that generates nice static html pages based on the wiki entries, and (C) the means of serving those html pages with nice styling at some official URL. Anyone can clone the repo and do whatever else they want with it. I'd love to see people build alternative tooling around this corpus of wiki entries.\n<@U02E4DAQGSZ>\n• I don't really want to couple anything to Google (or Amazon, etc). Everything that I've set up so far just assumes much more bog-standard \/ portable tech, like \"a programming language with regexes\" or \"a web server that can serve html files\". On the initial call where we hashed out this idea, one compelling thought was that by hosting the wiki git repo on GitHub, folks could use their web-based editor to write\/edit wiki entries. So we are doing that, but that's just additive, not essential.",
