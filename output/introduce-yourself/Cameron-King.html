Hello all. I'm Cameron. I found this place in a roundabout way--surfing Chris Granger's Twitter, he retweeted John Edwards who linked to Steve Krouse's Patreon, and enough link-surfing got me here. I'm currently unemployed, but my skills are in full-stack web development. To give you a sense of what interests me, a while ago I put out a project that reduces most conceptual operations on Vue components to 4 or 5 keystrokes made from anywhere in the file, and right now I'm experimenting in the world of self-editing web applications. It's actually surprisingly easy. I built my feasibility prototype as a Rollup plugin for Svelte projects, and it's only ~200 lines to start live-editing the application in place using the same underlying tech as the developer. As a next step, right now I'm exploring what developer tooling looks like when there's no longer any distinction between "editor" and "application".
