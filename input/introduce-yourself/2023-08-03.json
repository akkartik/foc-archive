I came across this Slack from <@U0275EZH3UN>’s work. I’ve found a lot of useful ideas here. Much thanks to everyone who’s put this community together.\n\nI’ve recently started building a “spreadsheet playground” with <@U05K3CWHE76> where we’re thinking about the spreadsheet medium from the ground up. The idea is to acknowledge and improve spreadsheets as an environment for building small information systems. We’re looking at patterns from the programming\/software-building world we can apply to simplify them a bit and make it easy to make reliable and maintainable spreadsheets.\n\nMy background is in software building and we want to work with folks who have experience in HCI\/PL\/notation design. I’d love to talk if any of it sounds interesting :)",
