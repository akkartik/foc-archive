Hi! I'm Zak, a software engineer living in Cary, NC, USA. I've been programming professionally for about 8 years and have been interested in better/new ways of doing things for most of that time. I saw a link to <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/061">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/061</a> on hacker news and found it really interesting/rewarding, and after looking through the main site this seems like a place where lots of people are interested in the same kinds of things as me! I have a running doc of things that kind of suck or interesting ideas I come across that involve computing (e.g. Xanadu, Gwern's practice of taking a snapshot of everything he links to, undo at the operating system level, Nix, to name a few) and I'm hoping to have some interesting conversations here!
