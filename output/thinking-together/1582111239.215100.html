In the quest for building composable components and managing complexity, monoids are an important pattern to familiarize yourself with. Brandon Kase is currently writing a great article series about exactly that in a delightful “programmer first, mathematician second” kind of style:<br/><a href="https://bkase.dev/posts/semigroups-and-monoids">https://bkase.dev/posts/semigroups-and-monoids</a><br/><a href="https://bkase.dev/posts/reducers-are-monoids">https://bkase.dev/posts/reducers-are-monoids</a><br/><br/>&gt; Semigroups and Monoids are the "20%" of algebraic objects that get you "80%" of the power. These are a functional programmer's basic building blocks: The ability to detect, digest, and discover them levels you up as an engineer!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Since I want this post to be maximally relevant to the audiences I think I'll reach, I'm preparing all code examples in OCaml, ReasonML, Haskell, and Swift throughout this post.
