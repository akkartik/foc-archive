One reason is getting rid of the impedance mismatch between 'database schema' and 'application programming languages'. The db has it's own schema language and is considered distinct from the other processes in the system. Middle tiers and web\/phone clients map exactly the same data into their own little in-memory schemas (classes, dicts, ...) with different schema languages - a whole bunch of repeated definitions with slightly different shapes and slices of the 'greater schema'. Doing this also makes syncing and cache consistency as problem to be solved separately. We can eliminate the notion of database itself, replace it with the idea of a global conceptual data model which is stored in a meta model and available system-wide to all processes.\n- Clear separation of the conceptual model from the implementation details. The in-memory data and messages on the wire may at any time be only different, small slices of the conceptual model. Where some computation happens should be independent of what computation happens.\n- Deep versioning, designed for incrementality and change (Peter mentioned this already) - no schema has only one version forever and any system that doesn't support versions as a first class concept will just mean we have to solve the problem outside the system and that doesn't work too well. With versions as first class entities in the meta model,  all instances of data or objects belong not just to a class but to a class@version. When you have class@version2, the in memory or persisted objects remain members of the older version until upgraded.\n- Persistence is orthogonal. Once the db is gone, do we only have in-memory objects? Of course not, we want to attach persistence annotations on our conceptual model that would define which objects are persisted, with what durability, reliability and what kind of system wide consistency.\n\nWhile neither Datomic nor SQL do all of the above, I do like (some) ideas in them. The relational set theory seems powerful and rich (though the SQL with exposed join keys seems yucky because that's an implementation detail). And the 'append only' idea in Datomic seems right.\n\nMany of the ideas above are very nicely elaborated on in a book I am reading and really enjoying (perhaps because it resonates so well with my thoughts) - Vertically Integrated Architectures by Jos Jong. I haven't finished the book yet but I would recommend it to anyone interested in this space - it argues well for a change to some deeply entrenched ideas.",
