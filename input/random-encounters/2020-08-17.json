Every so often, you'll be paired up with one other random person in this channel, via our friendly neighbourhood <@UFQ0XSFH6> bot. You and your pair can schedule a zoom call, or just chat via DMs. These pairings should happen about once per month on average, though the schedule will fluctuate a bit (since we're on the Donut free plan, so we're dealing with some limitations).\n\n• If you're ever paired with someone who is a no-show, you can click a button in the message you receive from Donut to request a different partner. You might want to tell me you had a no-show so I can remove them from the channel (presumably because they're no longer visiting the Slack).\n• You might be paired more frequently than once per month, or you might go for multiple months without a pairing. If that's the case, shoot me a DM and I'll see if I can get straightened out.\n• No need to wait for Donut to generate a pairing for you. Feel free to post here in the channel if you're looking for folks to chat with (though please take those social chats to DMs — this channel is for organizing chats, not actually having the chats).\n• And of course, if you ever have an interaction that feels bad or breaks the <https:\/\/github.com\/futureofcoding\/code-of-conduct|Code of Conduct>, please let me know.\nThe next round of pairs will be sent out Monday, August 24th. See you then!",
