I totally support your distinction and what you describe as “LLM saying something insightful” I consider one of the most important aspects of LLMs — they can help _you_ come to an insight. That’s also in the spirit of using LLMs as a muse over an oracle. This is the reason I see great potential in LLMs, in particular their use in Tools for Thought.\n\nI’m not sure where you’re trying to go with your comment about consciousness. Is it a complex, emergent phenomenon? Likely yes. Will we ever be able to fully comprehend how it works? Perhaps no. But you could also make the argument that we don’t really know anything about the universe. Yeah, we have some theories, and they turn out to have some pretty good predictive powers, which seems to be good enough for us to base all kinds of useful stuff on top of those theories, even though they are just simplified approximations, which likely lack important yet undiscovered aspects. With consciousness, I think we’re on a similar trajectory. Some day we’ll have better approximations of how it works so that we can do all kinds of weird stuff with that knowledge.\n\nThe current debates about AI being potentially conscious or sentient and how many tech people talk about alignment just shows how much more work needs to be done to understand the human side of it better. All the power we get from computation made us think that everything is computation (or at least everything is capable of being modeled by computation), to a point where people believe that we are just some kind of machine ourselves. That is ultimately 17th century thinking (Descartes, Hobbes, etc.) and we have made some progress to figure out that what makes us human goes beyond what is expressible through algorithms, and it seems to me that’s useful knowledge to build up in a time where AI is going to do anything that can be modeled with computation (which is obviously still a lot).\n\nVervaeke is busy publishing videos about AI on a weekly basis right now. I recommend just watching any of those to see that a debate with less tech and more cogsci about AI alignment is refreshingly different from the pure tech perspectives. I don’t know if the cogsci perspectives are “correct”, but they certainly add some valuable aspects to the discussion that are completely missing from most tech-focused discussions about it.",
