Good morning and hello all. My name is Jason Priestley, I'm a bay area software developer. I have one big idea for the future of software. It's hard to describe because it either sounds vague or trivial or incomprehensible depending on how I describe it, so I'll describe it in a few ways, and perhaps the sum will give a better sense of things.<br/><br/>My idea is to unify programmer and user. Seen from the programmer's side, this means an IDE that provides the discoverability and rich graphical UI that user's enjoy. Seen from the user's side, this means that their walled-garden "apps" are now part of one big app, they are unknowingly editing code by clicking buttons, and there is a smooth transition between graphical UI and code.<br/><br/>My idea is to bring the Lisp REPL into the graphical era. Read and Print are text-based primitives. The modern equivalent is a graphical UI that can extend and edit itself. The extension method may resemble Reader macros, but instead of taking over Read at certain syntax, it takes over the whole UI.<br/><br/>My idea is to make data into code. Lisp made code into data - a function declaration is also a linked list. Data into code means that whenever you are operating on data - editing a TODO list say - you are literally editing code in one big program. Editing your TODO list is a specialized UI that does the exact same thing as opening the TODOs variable in your code editor and typing out your changes manually.<br/><br/>My idea is to make a universal editor. Instead of one editor and many apps you have one editor that can be changed and customized to take on any behavior.<br/><br/>My idea is to complete the idea behind Emacs. People joke that Emacs is an OS, that you can do anything in Emacs. I take these jokes seriously. An extensible editor should be our OS, but emacs is too ad-hoc and too tied to text buffers to really suffice. Emacs, but the primitive operations are more low-level UI constructs, and graphical from the start.
