Yesterday I recorded the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJn9V1yaWd4">first episode</a> of Making Cell, which is basically going to be about building <a href="http://github.com/altocodenl/cell">cell</a> from the ground up, live. In this episode, I explain the basics and put some The Smiths in the background.

It would help interested visitors of your repository to provide more background about the application domains you are aiming at. "make programming as effective as possible" is a nice high-level goal, but for which kind of programs do you want to achieve this? Readers have to guess from the keywords that follow (database, service, interface - it's pretty clear that you are not thinking about embedded systems, for example).

Ah, good point! I'm still aiming (pretentious and impossible as it sounds) for universality. I wasn't thinking of embedded systems in particular, where you'd perhaps have minimal interfaces.<br/><br/>I'll make a clarification that I want to make it as universal as possible (knowing full well it might be a failure exactly because of this).<br/><br/>Thank you for checking it out!
