In brief: many of us feel like improving programming means being more data centric. We’re starting to think of programming more in terms of the representation and flow of data (and information), seeing how little imperative programming we use in a viable application. When it works, we’re rewarded with much more succinct, understandable, and forgiving applications, which is important for end user programming.<br/>Some of the things SQL does not afford but seem important here are: incrementality (hence Noria and others), expressivity of queries (hence Datalog and Datomic), understanding (hence …EXPLAIN?), history and forgiveness (Datomic again), and understanding it as part of a greater system (hence LINQ, I suppose, and complaints of a “impedance mismatch”).<br/>Actually, systems provide a good framing here: we have many of these qualities in particular technologies, but qualities like incrementality, expressivity, understanding, etc, stop at system boundaries. Being able to treat everything in your application, including its logic, as “just data” feels necessary for us to move forward with programming. You would have to dramatically reimagine SQL to accomplish this, but the theories it’s based on, and the research that’s been done since its creation, are absolutely key. Treating a database as a big hash map is going the wrong direction.<br/>Oh, sorry, that wasn’t brief.
