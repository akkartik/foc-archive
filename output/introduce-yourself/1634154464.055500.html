Hello All, I’ve been following FoC podcast and know Steve K. for some time. I focus on computing as a medium of thought and related topic. This takes me to thinking about systems, interfaces, languages, and general human focused directions within the world of technology. In the past I’ve built many things, worked in many different arrangements, and my educational background is in math.
