I haven't really felt like building in a while, but there's a cricket match on and today I felt moved to use <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/notebook.love">my notebook app</a> to create a little scenario calculator for the world championship.<br/><br/>This requires <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÃ–VE</a> (basically some way to draw pixels on a canvas) and 2.8kLoC of Lua. Compare Excel, or Google sheets + a web browser, or Jupyter. Much fewer features, of course, but well-sized for things like this. Though I did find myself wishing I could sort lines, the notebook doesn't support that yet..
