Hey there! :wave:<br/>I've been working with a friend on <b>CodistAI</b> (<a href="http://codist-ai.com/">http://codist-ai.com/</a>) for the past two months: it's about navigating and understanding source code in visual and more intuitive way. We render any code as a graph which is diggable, interactive and augmented (with quality and security info).<br/>We came up with that idea bc working on different projects and every time the same question "WTF is happening here ?!" especially when I face some kind of spaghetti code.<br/>Also I'm deeply interested in any way possible to make software development more dev friendly! :nerd_face:<br/><br/>I'm happy to join this channel!

When I started with a big code base recently (millions of lines) it would certainly have been nice to have a tool that could help me figure it out more easily, both at a very high level (like which folders/projects refer to code in which other folders/projects - it's a C# codebase, so Resharper's Architecture View did help with this) and at a lower level (like, given a thing I want to see other things that are related to it.) Since the code is of generally poor quality (and any time you hear "millions of lines" you can assume this) it would have been nice to have a tool that could discover patterns of relationships. Examples:<br/>- similar method names appear in many different classes<br/>- similar blocks of code appear in many places<br/>- tuples often appear together (e.g. if enum type A usually appears in the same parameter list, or field list, as class B and an integer called C, the tool could point this out, suggesting that A B and C are related and perhaps should be encapsulated in a new type.)<br/><br/>A tool could probably find hundreds or thousands of noteworthy patterns in a large codebase, so it would need ways of limiting what it shows the user (e.g. show patterns related to / exemplified by the source file I am looking at.)

Hello <span style="background-color:#ccf">@David Piepgrass</span> thanks for sharing your experience. I did not know about Resharper I'll look into it! It's really nice idea you mentioned to highlight tuples occurrences.<br/>So far, the tool we are developing handles Python code and dependencies mapping: <a href="http://app.codist-ai.com/">http://app.codist-ai.com/</a>
