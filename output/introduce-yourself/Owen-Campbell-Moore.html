Hello Friends! I am Owen, an ex-Google/ex-Facebook person working in SF on the future of coding.<br/><br/>My background / journey in this space:<br/>• I worked on Google Chrome for 3 years, leading Progressive Web Apps and the future of x-platform development<br/>• I concluded it was possible to build amazing web apps, but far far too hard<br/>• I am disappointed nobody has solved “write once, run everywhere”, but where the output is UI native to the target SDK (and includes Web Support), and adapted to the OS / form factor of the device <br/>• I became very interested in React Native development and love following the advancements in the React space<br/>My conclusions:<br/>• I believe we need to start coding at a way higher level of abstraction, i.e. describing the features of our products at a semantic level rather than UI and in terms of complex low-level logic<br/>• If we can increase the level of abstraction for coding for certain classes of apps I believe we can enable:<br/>    ◦ “Write once run everywhere”, but where the high level descriptions of products can be compiled into super polished native UIs best suited to the form factor of the target device.<br/>    ◦ Making it 1000X easier for people to build apps and web apps, since describing a feature semantically is far easier than at an implementation level<br/>My vision for the future of coding consumer software:<br/>• I want people to be able to re-build products like AirBnB by simply describing (in a formal Domain Specific Language, via a slick web GUI) the things users can do in the app, and then for the platform to compile this down to super polished UIs for every OS, plus auto generate a production backend.<br/>I’m working on this space at a new company I recently founded in San Francisco called Sutro, here’s a post with a bit more detail, and I’d love to feedback or to chat with folk any time interested in this! <a href="https://www.notion.so/Intro-to-Sutro-raising-the-level-of-abstraction-for-programming-by-multiple-orders-of-magnitude-06f2566973714b3298d8f3cf0ad29c66">https://www.notion.so/Intro-to-Sutro-raising-the-level-of-ab&hellip;</a>
