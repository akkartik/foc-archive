        "text": "&gt;  What if you write a crazy service that causes way too much load?\n1. Its rate limited but also 2. I hit their \"embed\" endpoint which is hosted on a CDN and targeted at 3rd party embedding on external websites.\n&gt; Do you think this can fly for real world projects?\nYes! Most features are implemented as webcode, for example, the <https:\/\/observablehq.com\/@endpointservices\/secrets|secrets API> is webcode hosted and wraps Google Secret Manager\nThe <https:\/\/observablehq.com\/@tomlarkworthy\/serverless-cell-latency-monitor|latency prober> I use to measure performance is also webcode implemented. We have got hot performance down to 30ms! It's not quite as fast as a dedicated lambda but its in an acceptable engineering trade off zone IMHO (devX for a little perf hit).\n&gt;  is there a way to host\/install the environment on your own cloud infrastructure of choice?\nYes it is technically possible, if you look at the API <https:\/\/observablehq.com\/@endpointservices\/webcode-docs#options|options>, you can set the remote and region, so you can host your own webcode.run container (and you can set it to localhost for testing). I have not documented the self hosting path yet, but I would like to encourage it when I have some demand for that. The runtime is in a single container, so it should be fairly portable. I use Cloud Run.\n&gt;  Is only the source code (as text) from Observable used but the actual executing server is deployed elsewhere?\nYeah Observable is the code hosting platform + reactive runtime. The compute is external (webcode.run uses Google Cloud Run but any docker hosting service \"should\" work, I am thinking about migrating to <http:\/\/fly.io|fly.io>). The realtime user control plane is Firestore though, and that is unlikely to be switchable.\n\nI would say the state of it is still a little pre-production. I am not providing an SLO or carrying a pager yet, but it is actively monitored and robustness has hugely improved in the last 6 months. I think it's amazing for API glue, but it struggles when you need a filesystem, like technically it can be a webserver, but uploading static assets is kinda hard so it can only really do small util endpoints at the moment.",

I am not providing an SLO or carrying a pager yet, but it is actively monitored and robustness has hugely improved in the last 6 months. I think it's amazing for API glue, but it struggles when you need a filesystem, like technically it can be a webserver, but uploading static assets is kinda hard so it can only really do small util endpoints at the moment."
