Hi all! I've been leeching here for a bit, but never properly introduced myself :face_with_hand_over_mouth:..<br/><br/>I'm Yousef, from Amsterdam, and lifelong programmer + startup. If there are any outdoor enthusiast here you might be familiar with Relive, a startup I cofounded and most successful project so far (app with 10M+ users).<br/><br/>Like many of you here I've always been interested in programming environments, probably triggered by Bret Victor  a long time ago :male_mage:.<br/><br/>Currently, I'm experimenting with a Reactive Live Programming environment, with support for TypeScript, React, NPM / esm modules. I hope to make this an open source project and to share this with you soon.<br/><br/>For now, I've recorded a first demo @ <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/9f9f91a10348478f9bb0300220452b10">https://www.loom.com/share/9f9f91a10348478f9bb0300220452b10</a>. Would be really cool to hear your feedback, and looking forward to being an active member of this community!
