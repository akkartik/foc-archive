Hi Hamish, just FYI, I often upload my videos as unlisted to YouTube, and they are 4K.  There are only 2 issues I've seen; firstly that it takes a lot longer for them to 'prepare' the HD version, and you get low res until it is processed.  Secondly, the first few seconds of viewing are blurred.  As far as I can tell this is just normal behavior.  Thinking about it, I wonder if this is due to me being a premium subscriber (I haven't looked back since turning that on and turning adverts off :wink:

The blurry image at the start could be because you've set it to auto on the resolution, so it's optimising for the discovered connection speed. Could try setting to the top resolution before playing?

Hi Duncan, yes, i think that works, but it puts the onus on the viewer.  I can't find a setting to select the default playback res.

Hmm, I’m not sure I totally understand your crisis of faith, but I have thoughts. Making a visual system as powerful as possible is a hard problem. To me is sounds like you are trying to make this an entirely visual interface without any symbolic formalism behind it? That would be crazy to pull off! I think it’s possible to include symbols, but to minimize their use as much as possible and get something both visual and powerful from it. <br/>

This is amazing stuff! I love the way in which the changes are propagated throughout the system and there are snapshots of each result on the border. One thing I wanted to ask was whether you have considered making the operations as a first class item in the language, that is, sometime when you are in a remix mode, you might want to move/swap around the operators themselves between the operands of another combination that will yield an unforeseen happenstance combination. I think such a structuring of the system could potentially lead to opening up the space for more creative operations.<br/><br/>I really love the direction and would love to see how this evolves. Great job!

Another idea is to have operations to swap around the operands themselves, so like in the cases where commutativity doesn’t hold, you can swap a • b to b • a.<br/><br/>Also, how about decomposition a la projection, that is, you can decompose a bivector into two vectors? (I guess some of these operations would be surjective and you might need to present the user with an option panel on how to decompose).<br/><br/>I think there are so many possibilities in here to experiment and I’m sure you might have thought about the possibilities through in here better than me. So I think it might also hepl having a focus on a core subset that fulfills the need of content creators who want to build pretty 3D visualization would be a great niche to try this out with. Have you started looking for such an audience for this yet?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Robin Allison</span> I'm quite "immoderate", certainly for now :smile: symbolism is a "last resort". Algebra had its "never use visualization" zealots: Bourbaki, Djikstra, Legrange, it seems only fair to have a "never use visualization" zealot.<br/>You can hear more about my (possibly dumb) reasons for this here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrDZ--AuiL8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrDZ--AuiL8</a> and, in case you've not seen it, in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR-MQm3c13Q">presentation on this project</a>, especially the parts about live coding and programming by diagram.<br/>In the back of my mind, I have a simulation of all of the many smart people who have, over the years, told me "visualization is good but it has limits". I've already made what feel like concessions :sweat_smile: and my simulation (and the real people...) will say "I told you so" at some point.<br/>I should stop now but I've got some notes on this for a talk at some point.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@hamish todd</span> Think drag and drop on operators, operands, and values. Just like how you can select some text and then drag and drop it to rearrange the text, if you make + and * a block like the operands, they would be amenable for drag and drop too. Say you drag a + from a certain operation and then drop it to an operation where there is a division and you will get to interactively explore what such things result in.<br/><br/>I recommend such an interaction under the notion that to pan around on the canvas, users might already reach out for their mouse. So letting some tinkering with the mouse available might also be helpful.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@hamish todd</span> That looks like a neat target market. I think kids would love this and also if you somehow map back or inline the equations (as a toggle-able mode), it would make it a great educational value to people who want to explore and learn GA (something like say: <a href="http://immersivemath.com">immersivemath.com</a>). They will get a chance to see what the interactions of these elements are like and map that back to the symbol runes they see in their texts.

Gotcha. First I'll say that I do like Bret Victor, and a lot of this is inspired by his work. It's clearly an embarrassment that, for a programmer to specify a vector, often all they can do is write eg vec2(2.9,4.4), when clearly that should be specified with the mouse (and a transform/dual quaternion should be specified with a VR controller!). The same is true of a function curve.<br/><br/>However, I agree with the criticism many have of Bret Victor/GRAIL/MaxMSP-style visual programming that they use mouse/drag-and-drop too much. The problem of "choose what the program does" almost always means "scroll to this point in execution, choose a function and some variables, and apply that". That is best done with a keyboard that impacts a carat. The number of variables and functions available to you is large enough that if you try to pick them from a menu, it'll take much longer than typing the name, and you'll be more likely to click the wrong thing.<br/><br/>I've considered having "click on this variable in the display window and its name is pasted at your carat", which is partway towards drag and drop. But I've never felt the need for that while using the system, so I might never implement that!<br/><br/>Indeed for the purpose you describe I was thinking about a toggle-able "just show me the names" mode. It might turn out to be unnecessary though!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@hamish todd</span> I see. I think its good for people to have strong perspectives like that! Geometric algebra just isn't the right problem then so I see what you are saying. Gotta say I'm a bit relieved you are leaving some cool stuff for the rest of us!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@hamish todd</span>  I wasn’t stressing on mouse driven interaction as much as the need for having the operation available. Something like what the command xp does in Vim on a single line, but that done on multiline is what I intended to achieve with making operations as first class citizen, that is do x (cut) on an operation and then p (paste) on another operation to swap their places. I think that will lead to more exploratory ideas in the system. But since I haven’t interacted with what you have built, there’s a chance that I could be off. But see if what I suggested fits, otherwise its cool. What you have shown so far is amazing. Looking forward to see what you do with it!
