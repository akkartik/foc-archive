You can't just make people have different values, and it takes Herculean effort to \"sell\" people on values. It seems to actually be almost impossible (e.g., see FSF). I think that would be an interesting topic in and of itself, when have new software values been successfully sold to people? The most successful example I can think of is Apple and privacy, the only other example that comes to mind is Free software, and open source in general, which has been far less successful (outside of developer technologies).

You can't just make people have different values, and it takes Herculean effort to \"sell\" people on values. It seems to actually be almost impossible (e.g., see FSF). I think that would be an interesting topic in and of itself, when have new software values been successfully sold to people? The most successful example I can think of is Apple and privacy, the only other example that comes to mind is Free software, and open source in general, which has been far less successful (outside of developer technologies). Are there others?"

It's trivially easy to archive digital music and video — that's a well-understood, well-addressed problem.\n\nPreserving executable software might be impossible for the same reason that preserving the exact performance of an actor in a play is impossible. We can't have our \"computing is a process\" cake and \"but we can treat it as an object\" eat it too. See, for instance, the CRT example in the thread. The performance of an actor is an execution of the play by the human performer. The performance of a software work is an execution of the code by the machine performer. The capability of the performer in both cases comes as a result of their unknowable complexity.",

                "text": "Arcan is a powerful development framework for creating virtually anything between user interfaces for specialised embedded applications all the way to full-blown standalone desktop environments. Boot splash screen? no problem. Custom Interface for your Home Automation Project? sure thing. Stream media processing? Of course.\nIt has been used in a number of both experimental, hobby, academic research and commerical projects and products alike, in areas ranging from VR desktops to industrial computer vision systems for robotic automation.\nAt its heart lies a robust and portable multimedia engine, with a well-tested and well-documented interface, programmable using Lua. At every step of the way, the underlying development emphasises security, performance and debugability guided by a principle of least surprise in terms of API design.\nSee the Videos&nbsp;page for videos from some of the public projects built using the engine as a main component. Most of the detailed user and development documentation can be found on the Wiki&nbsp;and the development discussion goes on in the #arcan IRC channel on freenode.\nFor a high-level presentation, please refer to this&nbsp;video:\n\nThere are too many features to cover, but here follows an brief listing of the &ldquo;basics&rdquo;:\n\nInput devices:&nbsp;Keyboards, Mice, Joysticks\/other game devices, Touch displays, VR headsets, Eye trackers.\nOutput devices:&nbsp;Mixed DPI, Multi-monitor, Multi-\/hotswap- GPU, Custom LED controllers.\nAudio:&nbsp;Streaming playback, Device capture,&nbsp; Sample playback.\nNetwork Sharing:&nbsp;Bidirectional VNC. Per-client Audio, Video and Input streaming.\nVideo:&nbsp;Complex 2D hierarchies and animated transforms, 3D models, Offscreen rendering effects, GPU shaders, Picking, Streaming video Sources and Streaming Recording.\nSystem integration:&nbsp;Client state management, Suspend\/Resume, Monotonic Timers, Hotplug, Load balancing, DoS protection.\nPortability: Native graphics on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD. High-level graphics on OSX.\nClient support:&nbsp;Easy to use native APIs, Dedicated backends for Wayland,&nbsp; Xorg, QEmu, builtin terminal emulator and libretro.\nDisplay &amp; Desktop server features:&nbsp;Server, Client and window manager crash recovery. Hot-pluggable custom input drivers, clipboard managers, assistive tools,\n\nWith that comes a rich set of tools for network proxying, debugging, profiling and integrating with assistive devices.",
