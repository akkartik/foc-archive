Running a program within Qemu is more secure than browsing to a website in a web browser.)\n• Wait 2 minutes for the ~60MB of archives to get loaded into RAM.\n• Press `\/` to search and then type in exactly `Is there any hope` and hit enter. (There's no keyword search and search is case-sensitive at the moment.)\n• Press enter on the post by Roben Kleene that is highlighted. It won't look like much has happened, the highlight will just disappear. But you're in a new page now, having jumped from the search screen to a thread view.

Again, hit enter on the highlighted post to jump to its thread view.\n• Oh, bonus third thread. Search for `old blog posts` for my list of programs I've written for myself. It's a comment on a third thread which is also relevant.\nApologies in advance for the crappy UX, but I have high hopes that these image files -- with every byte lovingly hand-crafted all the way up from machine code -- will continue to be browseable in 50 years time. (You'd just need to get your hands on a 2070-era x86 emulator.) I'd also love to jam with anyone interested in improving the search or anything else.\n\nNeedless to say, both <@UBN9AFS0N>'s history browser and mine are examples of programs we've written for ourselves. They're kinda idiosyncratic, and we often work around their limitations rather than fix them. But they've both allowed us to treat this group's history as part of our exo-brain. I consider them great examples of the sorts of programs people would benefit from (without learning machine code) if they learned programming.",
