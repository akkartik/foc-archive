i can probably dredge up the talks he gave with steps if anyone is interested. his classic move was to interrupt the presentation on the FoC to point out that he obviously wasnâ€™t using powerpoint, to hit a button, and have all his slides fall apart graphically as they were held together with a physics-ish constraint system a la sketch pad (or do a demo of how text got laid out with a logic reminiscent of ant colonies)

It's very frustrating. For all of Alan Kay's vision and breadth of knowledge he's subject to a fairly mundane academic blind spot: the false dichotomy between research and "a hardened general development system".<br/><br/>There's a growing awareness today that papers about computer science are inferior without source code, that source code needs to be easy to build and run, and that it needs to build and run on the systems people have access to. I think these factors are far more important than the quality of empirical studies. Any sort of realistic empirical study of tool use just has too many variables to nail down. But if you make a working system available to people and 200 people try it out over 10 years, then all sorts of insights should shake out of that relatively immersive usage that will never come up in a traditional, superficial review process.<br/><br/>A system for general development doesn't have to be compatible with existing software, and it doesn't have to work at the scale of a Google or Facebook. Aim for 200 people over 10 years. But that requires a fundamentally different mindset than raising funding, publishing a paper, throwing code over a wall, and calling it done.
