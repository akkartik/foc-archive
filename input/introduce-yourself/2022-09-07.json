I've been lurking around for a while, but thought maybe I'll introduce myself and start taking part in some of the discussions :). I've been writing code for around 15 years, working most of my professional career as a consultant. Currently I'm working both as a freelancer and on my own fore mentioned unreleased textual low-code\/no-code (business) logic programming solution. I've been working on and thinking about the project since 2016-2017, mostly only occasionally, but recently also full time. The project has taken many turns on the way, but I certainly hope I can share some progress within months, not years!",
