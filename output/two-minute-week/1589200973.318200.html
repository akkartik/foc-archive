It was a slow week this week.  I found I didn't have my usual energy for after-hours projects, and I needed a rest this weekend.  As is usually the case in such circumstances, I spent some time cleaning up code and refactoring - I often find such activities help keep the project momentum up, while requiring less time &amp; effort.<br/>I have spent some time recently thinking about how to manage note events and synchronize beats &amp; timing.  It seems like a good idea to integrate Ableton Link at the outset, because on some level it helps drive towards a cleaner management of such things.  It is also really nice to have a built in way for musicians to work together with a live coder; a USP perhaps.  I don't say it in the video, but the tempo of the audio is being controlled using the iPad drumming app, which the sample app and the synth are aligning with.<br/>Another piece of ongoing work is the integration of Orca-c which I've shown previously.  This is an embedded Orca inside my text editor and forms one way in which a coder can drive the synthesizer (and later, I hope, some geometry/graphics too).  Orca isn't the only way I intend to generate music, but it represents a relatively easier integration than music languages, etc.  As I say in the video, there is still work to do to complete this feature.

Pop Corn is totally the TodoMVC of music tools. Nice.
