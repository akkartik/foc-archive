I don't think it needs to be a rule, but it'd be nice if we had, oh, half as much derailing as we do now. Suggestions for how to approach that without naming &amp; shaming people?",

I don't think it needs to be a rule, but it'd be nice if we had, oh, half as much derailing as we do now. Suggestions for how to approach that without naming & shaming people?"

So you show them all the data like diarrhea, and of course let them accidentally change a piece of data by accident in the process. I don't know any high level businessman who trusts spreadsheets due to their lack of any checks against inadvertent data.  But for informal work, Excel is great. But if someone uses Excel as part of their core accounting processes, they should be ashamed.\n\nThe f(g(h())) function composition model is a power tool. So you can do h(g(f())), etc., in fact the 3 functions if they are fully composable gives you 3 different results when used one at a time, 6 different results two at a time, and 6 different results 3 at a time. That 15 different actions by my counting. This geometric explosion of possible outcomes is different than pipes, which are sequential processes, and due to the nature of the transformations being typically unstructured have a fixed order. Rarely can you take a piped operation and shuffle the order and have it make sense. This compounding power of functions is #1 leverage system used in computers. It is the superpower of the call\/return with arguments that is all we have besides the assignment statement when you get to assembler. FP was supposed to make things more composable, but that didn't pan out because of other factors.",

So you show them all the data like diarrhea, and of course let them accidentally change a piece of data by accident in the process. I don't know any high level businessman who trusts spreadsheets due to their lack of any checks against inadvertent data.  But for informal work, Excel is great. But if someone uses Excel as part of their core accounting processes, they should be ashamed.\n\nThe f(g(h())) function composition model is a power tool. So you can do h(g(f())), etc., in fact the 3 functions if they are fully composable gives you 3 different results when used one at a time, 6 different results two at a time, and 6 different results 3 at a time. That 15 different actions by my counting. This geometric explosion of possible outcomes is different than pipes, which are sequential processes, and due to the nature of the transformations being typically unstructured have a fixed order. Rarely can you take a piped operation and shuffle the order and have it make sense. This compounding power of functions is #1 leverage system used in computers. It is the superpower of the call\/return with arguments that is all we have besides the assignment statement when you get to assembler. FP was supposed to make things more composable, but that didn't pan out because of other factors."

You didn't hurt Doug's feelings — give him the benefit of the doubt, he's probably emotionally self-aware enough that someone can criticize FP without him taking it personally (...though that said, we all have our bad days, so who knows).\n\nThe thing that Doug raised as a concern was that you torpedoed his thread about _particular ideas in FP_ with a broad, difficult-to-respond-to critique of FP itself.\n\nSo I think the thing that he would like, as I understand it from his <#CEXED56UR|administrivia> post, is for you to be more _relevent_ in your responses. You can still be critical — criticism and critique are _huge_ parts of the discussions we have here in this community — but he (and I) would like you to try to keep your criticism pointed rather than scattered, and full of more constructive ideas that people can make use of rather than recounting your credentials.",
