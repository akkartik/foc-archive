Hi Steve, hi everyone. I've been following many of you on Twitter for a good while now, and decided it was time to join the Slack group after <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nikolas Martens</span> mentioned it positively in his most recent Zells project log.   <br/><br/>I've lived my entire life in central Alberta, Canada — currently building a house in a remote forest with no phone service and barely any internet.<br/><br/>Life Story (Abridged): I taught myself 3D animation as a kid/teen, which led to a job with a small company in a nearby town that makes some very neat interactive learning media. Over the past decade, I've taught myself to code, and am now the main software dev at the company.<br/><br/>Currently, I'm working on a new suite of tools for our simulation-crafting artists. I want to give them a programming experience that's worthy of being called "Victor-esq", vaguely in the tradition of HyperCard and SmallTalk, loosely inspired by system-centric video games like Factorio or SimCity, with tools as rich and powerful as I'm used to from 3D animation. I'll be sharing progress after I've finished the divergent prototyping phase and start to converge on a specific approach.<br/><br/>I'm also a huge experimental music nerd, so DM me if you want to talk about Max/MSP or Brian Current's "Slanted Time" or Godfried-Willem Raes.  <br/>  <br/>Twitter: <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span>  <br/>Portfolio: <a href="http://spiralganglion.com">spiralganglion.com</a>

Hi Max! Glad to see you here. Everyone, Max is an excellent follow on twitter — highly recommended. Max has some very interesting perspectives into the space of game design, in addition to all the above.
