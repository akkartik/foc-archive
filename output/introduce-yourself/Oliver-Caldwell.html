Hey! I’m Ollie, a language and text editor nerd writing Clojure for fun and profit! Currently at Viasat hacking on parens.<br/><br/>I’ve been working on interactive programming tools for Vim for the last few years, my pride and joy so far is Conjure (<a href="https://github.com/Olical/conjure">https://github.com/Olical/conjure</a>), interactive lisp evaluation for Neovim. The primary language is Clojure but it also supports Fennel and Janet with Common Lisp potentially being the first contributed client! <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/325517">https://asciinema.org/a/325517</a><br/><br/>This work got me interested in the general concept of having a conversation with your program so I wrote that up here: <a href="https://oli.me.uk/conversational-software-development/">https://oli.me.uk/conversational-software-development/</a><br/><br/>And now I have an itch to develop a 3D spatial non-text programming environment with stepping / time travel through the execution of the program based on ClojureScript in the browser. Another goal of this is full VR support where you’re exploring the program in space. The program itself would eventually be exportable and runnable wherever you wanted. This is an experimental concept that I don’t intend to be used in anger, but I want it to be good enough to solve Advent of Code problems, for example.<br/><br/>After ranting about this on twitter I was directed here and I’m so glad to have discovered you! :smile:
