I've made a new small <a href="https://youtu.be/sU5s_iVjL70">video</a> where I've implemented a chat assistant using the OpenAI Chat Completion API in Code flow canvas (this is the visual programming system that I am building in my spare time). Goals for building this visual flow are to learn more about the OpenAI API's and LLM's in general, but also to see if something like this could be build without building in special knowledge about OpenAI in code flow canvas itself. I had to extend code flow canvas off course, but only with generic node-types which could be used in this flow. You can try it our yourself on <a href="http://demo.codeflowcanvas.io">demo.codeflowcanvas.io</a>, but only if you have an OpenAI API key with some credits
