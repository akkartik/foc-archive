Thanks!\n\nWe do ML (ReasonML), but not Machine Learning :slightly_smiling_face: Two reasons:\n1) we learned the hard way that heuristics makes the product unusable. If the results are not predictable, users have a hard time building habits around it. We want a 1:1 cause\/effect relationship between the design and the output.\n\n2) many attempts in this space treat ML as a blackbox - take an entire design and feed it into an algorithm and hope for good results. We're generating code that can be put in use for building complex web applications, not just websites. This means the generated code should aspire to be as perfect as possible, and programmers should be able to grok it immediately. There are areas were ML will be useful in a fine-grained manner; a scalpel than a hammer, but at the moment we're able to produce great results with a good old fashioned expert system.",

If the results are not predictable, users have a hard time building habits around it. We want a 1:1 cause\/effect relationship between the design and the output.\n\n2) many attempts in this space treat ML as a blackbox - take an entire design and feed it into an algorithm and hope for good results. We're generating code that can be put in use for building complex web applications, not just websites. This means the generated code should aspire to be as perfect as possible, and programmers should be able to grok it immediately. There are areas were ML will be useful in a fine-grained manner; a scalpel than a hammer, but at the moment we're able to produce great results with a good old fashioned expert system."
