A user told me once that my tool made him feel like he had super powers. The tool was (and remains) buggy as hell (a block-based visual DSL), but it was good enough, because that feeling motivates use. Use generates feedback, and feedback will help you find and fix incorrectness. So the software doesn't need to even be good enough right away.
