This quote comes to mind, "[F]or most of us, even a simple image manipulation in Photoshop presents insurmountable difficulties... any less-than-perfect edit immediately makes the image look completely unrealistic. To put another way, classic visual manipulation paradigm does not prevent the user from “falling off” the manifold of natural images" <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/aia/">https://distill.pub/2017/aia/</a>.  (Programming language syntax has a similar fall off.)  The rest of the article is well worth the read.  They have high aspirations, "Ideally, an interface will surface the deepest principles underlying a subject, revealing a new world to the user. When you learn such an interface, you internalize those principles, giving you more powerful ways of reasoning about that world."
