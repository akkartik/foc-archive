Hey all, I'm Ahmad and got introduced to this community through <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Cole Lawrence</span>. I've been lurking around for a couple months, so I think it's time for me to introduce myself. I'm a student who loves working with functional programming, compilers and cool ways to speed things up. I've been enjoying the fresh perspectives this community has on computer interaction. It's nice to explore the ideas on here, I'm excited to tag along and learn! :)
