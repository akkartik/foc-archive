What i mean by collecting state transition logic, is what they did in the Simula language. Unlike Java which has a tendency to disperse state transition logic across different source code files, because each class might have some logic associated with it, my assertion is that when the state logic is collated into one central place it is far easier to understand it. One of the toughest parts of learning someone else's code is understanding what the states are, and what causes the machine to go from one state to another. In complex systems it can be extremely hard to figure out, especially looking at a static system. Usually you have to fire up the system and put in tracing to see how it behaves. Debugging incorrect transitions is one of the reasons why reversible systems hold such great promise.
