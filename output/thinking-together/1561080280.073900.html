With twentyish (yikes) years of experience with typed functional programming and dynamical languages, my feelings are really complicated.  Languages with principle types are really cool: the compiler can infer all the types from a well formed program; but they don't exactly have the amount of flexibility that you might like.  Sometimes you'd like "types" that correspond to stronger propositions about programs, but then an expression can have multiple "types" depending.  Then you get into dependent types, gradual types, subtypes (covariant, contravariant), type classes, generalized algebraic data types, and it doesn't feel quite so nice or elegant anymore.
