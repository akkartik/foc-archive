<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Maggie Appleton</span> Wow! Is it full already? :cry: I didn't know it was going to get full. I was really looking forward to this. Do you need a bigger venue? Are there many people on the wait list or is it just me? I had subscribed to the Luma FoC profile but didn't get an email. :sob: Hope some space opens up. Cheers!

Ooops. After thinking about it, you might put everyone in a waitlist in order to vet them. Hoping that's the case. Cheers!

Unfortunately it usually fills up within a few days of me posting it. I always post it here 24 hours before putting it on Twitter to give FoC people a better chance of getting in.<br/><br/>The limit is both because we have a max capacity in the venue for safety, and to make sure the event doesnâ€™t feel huge and overwhelming to everyone who comes. We usually have ~100 of the 150 people turn up, which is at the edge of a comfy, friendly amount. Always want everyone to feel like they can meet everyone in the room and not get lost in the crowd, which requires limiting numbers.<br/><br/>In the 48 hours before the event we <em>always</em> get people who drop out and spaces open up, so if you keep an eye on the event page you might be able to grab a spot

I got my ticket! Thanks! One thing I discovered about <b>Luma, which may be useful for anyone currently on the waitlist</b>, is that if you put yourself on the waitlist and a ticket becomes available then <b>you don't automatically get assigned that ticket</b> and you don't get a notification saying that a ticket is available. So, luckily I was monitoring the event page from another browser that wasn't logged in, which enabled me to discover there was a spare ticket. And I had to cancel my waitlist space (and reload the page) in order register for a ticket, which felt a little risky, but I was obviously quick enough! :wink: I have been educated that there is more than one way to code a waitlist! :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: Look forward to meeting up!
