        "text": "<@UP00ZLX6G> going back to our side thread on messes:\n• It's true that we can make messes in digital spaces. For example, my dad had things strewn over his desktop. He'd position things carefully for a while so he knew where things were spatially, but inevitably the number of things would overflow, and he'd periodically shove everything into a new folder called \"old desktop\". Which always leads me to wonder why the Desktop is the only folder that remembers locations.\n• One thing that makes my digital footprint seem \"not messy\" even though it probably is -- is that I can always find things very easily, using some unexpected attribute that my associative memory can tug on. A keyword, a connection to a person or a time. Search in the real world seems fundamentally limited. Where Bret Victor demonstrates it, it requires the entire space being searched over to be laid out visibly. Again, no scrolling.\n• I think what I'm saying is the Marie Kondo approach is a kind of hairshirt you don't need in digital spaces. Just become a hoarder, the water is fine! No, don't drink that water near the door..",

So a few of these sheets of paper, working together, might enable the \"identify fiducials\" behaviour, by communicating with each other, each of them doing a tiny bit of computation. Some of them might represent some piece of supporting tech, like a sensor (eg camera) or an actuator (eg projector), and act like an API to that thing. One of the things you could do in this setup was point a keyboard object (with its own fiducials) at one of these sheets of paper, and edit the wishes and claims that constitute the computation that that sheet of paper possesses. That means if there's actual \"\"\"code\"\"\" printed on that piece of paper, the code is now out of sync with the real \"object\" (in memory), but that's fine — you could just wish for a new version of that object to be printed as code on paper, take down the old one, and put up the new one, and now they're back in sync.\n\nThen, in 2020, after the pandemic, they needed a way to take Realtalk home with them. So instead of doing all this on a poster, they condensed it down to a binder. Crucially, the pieces of paper don't always need to be visible at all times — the paper (or any object) is just a physical representation of its own behaviour. So you can pull out the paper and let a camera see it if you want to work on that object's behaviour, but when you're not working on it, you can tuck it into a binder. The object still exists. (I think there's some nuance here, since some objects do need to be visible in order for their computation to run, but I think that's, like, a choice of trigger, to put it in eToys speak).\n\nNow, with Realtalk 2024, they're trying to get further away from the \"textual code on pieces of paper with fiducials\" bits, by making it so that you don't need (A) the fiducials to track objects, (B) the pieces of paper — bits of behaviour can be manipulated readily by other kinds of representation, eg drawings — and (C) the textual code, or at least not the sort of textual code they've been using thus far, which is basically some existing language (python, JS, C, etc) with a DSL for wish\/claim.",
