No coding here, but this is fantastic.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/interactive/2024/michael-lewis-chris-marks-the-canary-who-is-government/">The Canary</a><br/><br/>&gt; And yet even now his father hovered in the background both as a rhyme and a presence. The careers of both men had been redirected by a simple question posed in a college class. Both spent their lives measuring the stress in stone. Both used scientific methods to answer questions that had seemed to everyone else beyond the reach of science. Both sought to understand what prevented roofs from collapsing. The father’s work had received a lot of public attention and the son’s had not. But that was just an accident of what people cared about. A lot of people cared about Gothic cathedrals; fewer were concerned with whatever was happening to workers deep underground.

The story about the roof bolts is hugely well told, as is the framing overall. To convey the serious moral outrage that anyone else should take credit for these discoveries, and the technology transfer therein, given that Chris Mark of this piece is so humble. That's an incredible piece of writing.
