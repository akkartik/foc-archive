I’m really passionate about teaching and mentoring new developers. \nI teach about the fundamentals of OOP, clean code, TDD and CI\/CD. A big part of my teaching goes towards how to approach a problem in a structured manner and motivating people to approach things in different ways.\nI also teach intermediate developers about big data tooling and make them ready for being a individual contributor for “data” projects.\nI am excited to be a part of this group so that I can share some new ideas with my trainees. I’m also inspired by the visions of Bret Victor and the future of programming excites me. ",
