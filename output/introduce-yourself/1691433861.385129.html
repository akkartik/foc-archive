Hi everyone, I am Eugene and I am super excited to join this community (referred by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span>). I am a designer-turn-engineer and have been design tools in the app building space, most recently at Palantir.<br/><br/>I've recently switched into research mode, thinking about how GenAI can help people, especially non-techies, build their own tools. I am writing and building prototypes around this idea and posting all these things here: <a href="https://blog.eugenechantk.me/?tag=appbuilding">https://blog.eugenechantk.me/?tag=appbuilding</a><br/><br/>I am just in awe that there is a community out here that is thinking and working on what I am passionate about. Love to chat or meet up if anyone is in SF
