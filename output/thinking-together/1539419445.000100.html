I have yet to listen to the podcast, but I don’t think it’s as easy as saying “money ruined x”. We live in a capitalist world, and that means a lot of things are driven by money. This can be good and bad.<br/><br/>I do agree that there are some ways where money is used in the wrong and dangerous ways. Often it’s the business model that creates unintended consequences. YouTube (and Facebook) are broken because the ad model sets wrong incentives, so we ruined privacy and have algorithms that keep people in their bubbles or worse show them more extreme stuff. The App Store and Play Store are broken because they set expectations that you can get good value for free and they devalued good work. US politics is broken because of lobbying and the way campaigning works, shifting power to the wealthy. But that’s all not just purely because money exists, but because of the way it is used.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, there needs to be some money coming from somewhere if you want to do anything sustainable. Even open source projects where people spend just their free time, these people need to feel secure enough to sustain their daily lives and have the money for that. Nobody would count that into the cost of their project, but if that money disappears, for sure their priorities would change quickly.<br/><br/>So I wouldn’t want to say let’s keep money out of open source, because it’s already there anyway, even if we can’t see it directly. I do however support thinking hard about the impact certain funding models might have, especially in terms of unintended consequences.
