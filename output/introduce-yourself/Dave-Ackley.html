Hi folks.  I'm here at the invitation of David Broderick, who liked a "Future of Programming" video I did a few years ago.  I started coding on the IBM 1130 in the early '70s and my first programming language stuff was doing the code generator for (what became) the "Sargasso C" compiler for TOPS-10/-20 in the late '70s.  I did machine learning in the '80s, artificial life and distributed systems in the '90s, and biological approaches to computer security in the '00s.  Since about 2008 I've been on a mission to develop a computer architecture that abandons the assumption of hardware determinism and instead embraces best-effort throughout a reinvented computational stack.  The resulting "Movable Feast Machine" looks like a cellular automata on steroids and we are only at the beginnings of developing basic structures and programming paradigms for it.
