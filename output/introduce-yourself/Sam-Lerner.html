Hello. My name’s Sam and I’m from Columbus, Ohio. I’m a software engineer mainly working in binary analysis.<br/><br/>I just found this group through a 100r podcast about making your own tools and I had to see what its all about.<br/><br/>I enjoy all facets of computing but I mainly find myself reverse engineering these days. I’m currently working on reverse engineering the Wacom tablet driver to create my own (I know these already exist but I enjoy going through the process myself).<br/><br/>I’m looking forward to exploring this community and hopefully meeting like-minded people. Cheers.
