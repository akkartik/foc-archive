Couple of months ago I made a presentation in my university called "Towards efficient development tools".<br/>Now it is finally published on YouTube. I would love to hear your feedback.<br/><br/>In presentation I tried to show the possibility and need for better tools. I did a short overview of existing FoC projects, talked a bit about project I am working on: a generic tree editor (structure editor) that doesn't tied up to any PL. I also talked about idea of designing PL by balancing Order and Chaos, ideas that I got from Jordan Peterson.<br/><br/>I believe that breakaway from text-based editing towards structure-based is an inevitable event for future of programming.<br/>I also have some other ideas about programming languages that I would like to build on top of this tree editing platform, but it is not covered in presentation.<br/><br/>I decided to make an academic career, that's why I've enrolled to university.<br/>This presentation is small step that I've attempted towards that direction.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8UH3DjvxDE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8UH3DjvxDE</a>

Looks great, though I was wondering if the slides were complete.<br/><br/>For academic rigor it's worth mentioning the drawback of modifying just the programming environment and not the language: since you're retrofitting the language with concerns it wasn't designed for, it's harder to do science. A negative result may not tell you much, just that your particular approach doesn't work.

Actually, I am not sure how I can do solid scientific work here yet. Very hard to measure improvement.

Science doesn't have to be quantitative. When a domain has few variables and concrete metrics, science is quantitative. When it has lots of variables and metrics are unclear, you can still follow the spirit of Science. The key is to ask yourself: how would I know this is a bad idea? What does it take to <em>falsify</em> it to my own satisfaction, so that I can switch gears and go work on something else with a clear conscience?
