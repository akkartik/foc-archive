Hi, I'm Paul (from Karlsruhe, Germany) and I discovered the Future of Coding podcast only a few days ago, feeling it resonate a lot with visions and yearnings accompanying me for the last 30+% of my life and being soaked into a huge rabbit hole of great ideas.<br/><br/>When I was a kid, one of my hobbies was imagining a program mixer. I'd take two computer programs and the program mixer would spit out a new piece of software. It was a great feeling to think about all the possibilities that (imaginary) program mixer would give me. Later, I had some fun with Cycle.js and even wrote an own prototypical FRP framework with some different accents. I also contributed a little to Athens Research, which is still my personal knowledge base. Unfortunately, I have a hard time getting my long-term ideas to paper -- I definitely have to work on it.<br/><br/>Today, the more I think about programming, the more I feel that it's about organizing knowledge. A nice code base is like a well-written book. In both cases, a lot of refactoring, "debugging" and striving for consistency and clarity is required. (And source code is just one of many knowledge fragments in a project...) Sometimes, when our underlying theories change, we have to "reframe" an entire code or knowledge base. Maybe similar tools can help in both situations. Might there be a single tool for programming and knowledge organization?<br/><br/>Right now, I am reading some climate science to build an explorable explanation of the underlying history and epistemology for beginners. The heart of the explanation will be a series of simulations of various basic climate models (e.g. earth=blackbody, no regional variations etc.), all of them being simple enough to run in a web browser. The most complex model will take into account water vapor and the user will be able to fiddle with the parameters. I have a twofold interest in this project: I have a passion learning and explaining things. On the other hand, I'm struggling myself with basing my epistemology on solid ground and expect to learn a lot from how climate scientists (or other scientists) bootstrapped their epistemology. If someone's interested in working together, just text me! :)

Oh hey, another Karlsruhe person, what are the odds? :smiley:

What a nice surprise! Would you enjoy a short meetup in some café in the new year?

Sure! Just be warned that I’m much less of an active force in bringing forth the future of coding than (I feel) many of the other folks around here :)

No worries (I guess most of my projects never got finished either and I seem to have thought more than I created in the last years). But I enjoy getting to know people with similar interests.<br/>(I see from your introduction that you were working on your Master's thesis in June 2021 -- me too, good timing)

Maybe you guys want to join #in-germany? Looks like there is going to be an Berlin meetup in February.
