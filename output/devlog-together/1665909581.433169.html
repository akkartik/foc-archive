Hi, I've been fixing some bugs in my "infinite-canvas based visual interactive programming editor inspired on flow based programming"(yeah that's a lot of words.. playing around with finding a proper sentence to describe it:blush:) .. you could already edit the program live , make changes and see the results directly.. but there were some scenario's that didn't behave correctly so that the program became "dead" and needed a browser refresh to come alive again..I fixed those... it had todo with resetting the internal flowrunner-engine on wrong moments after making changes to the visual flow: the program now stays alive even if you make bugs. I'll really do my best to make a small video about this soon:blush: .. and yeah the strange loop talk by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jack Rusher</span>  was also very inspiring to me, thanks!:sunglasses:
