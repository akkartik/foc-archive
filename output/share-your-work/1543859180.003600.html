New podcast episode! <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/33">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/33</a><br/><br/>It's a good one to begin with if you haven't been following from the beginning. I talk a lot about my new /about page and the vision for the project

In this podcast, you describe two of your influences: "Out of the Tar Pit", and Conal Elliott's "Can functional programming be liberated from the von Neumann paradigm?"<br/><br/>I read them both (thanks for the tip-offs!), and both in turn refer to Backus' 1977 Turing lecture "Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?".<br/><br/>This turns out to include an early (the earliest?) description of the approach that I'm using in Onex! Again, thanks for the indirect tip-off!<br/><br/>Backus called the approach AST or Applicative State Transition systems. Here, you have pure functions that transform a state into a new state that replaces it.<br/><br/>I'm guessing it wasn't very popular, as I have never come across it until today (AFAIR), and I've been researching this whole area since the 1980s! :slightly_smiling_face:

Out of the Tar pit, of course, proposes a different "FRP" - Functional Relational Programming, which is similar in its approach to state and state transformation by a pure logic.

Yes, Backus definitely deserves a hat tip from me, but I often forget him. Conal Elliot talks about Backus frequently. Conal also mentions Peter Landin a lot

In listening to the latest podcast a few thoughts.<br/><br/>I'm sure you already know this and I know 100% it's not what you're trying to create but just in case you don't know, Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel (and I think Microsoft Outlook, and probably Project and PowerPoint) all have Visual Basic built in with an entire giant IDE with form editors, code editors, etc...  I know they aren't running a fancy language, they also are not the actually app code itself but they do let you modify the apps operations and lots of companies use them for custom solutions.<br/><br/>Google Docs/Sheets/etc added JavaScript scripting apparently because Office users were pushing to be able to create similar solutions to the ones they had in MS Products.<br/><br/>There's also things like Photoshop is scriptable from JavaScript and of course a lot of Mac software is scriptable from AppleScript. Windows software is often scriptable from any language that speaks the Windows Scripting Host protocol. That used to include Visual Basic, Perl, Python, JScript and probably includes C# and F# now a days.<br/><br/>Of course on both platforms every app has its own API and is often undocumented. On the Windows one there was a way for each API to expose docs as part of its public interface and there's an API explorer Microsoft provides. It's been so long since I've used it I don't remember what it's called. It might be the OLE object explorer.<br/><br/>That's another tech that I think died out I think. OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) was an Microsoft Standard that let you embed a view of one app inside another. You used to be able to for example select a block of cells in Excel and paste them into Word and have them linked live and if you clicked on the cells in the word document parts of the excel interface would appear. It's been so long since I've used MS Office I have no idea if that's still a thing but they had a standard and 10 to 50 apps supported it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Linking_and_Embedding">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Linking_and_Embedding</a><br/><br/>Just passing on info.<br/><br/>I have some thoughts but will let them percolate for a while

Interesting context, thanks for sharing <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Gregg Tavares</span>! I didn't know all that! Yeah it's both reminiscent what I'm hoping to create and also so far - all these tools and scripting languages off to the side. Of the ones you listed, I've only used Google Sheet's scripting and it was a nightmare. If you compare Google Sheets scripting to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Glen Chiacchieri</span>'s Flowsheets, it's really night and day: a system with a FFI for code and a <b>programming system</b>

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> I’m partway through the podcast and it seems like you’re pondering some of the same things I am in terms of content-addressed storage (immutable hashes). For me, it seems like a key part of building programs that wouldn’t break/bitrot over time if the user didn’t want to update. As you mentioned, naming/persistent reference is a problem.<br/><br/>My toy project idea for exploring this space is to figure out how to host a blog on IPFS that contains cycles of links. For the naming thing, one approach is indexing combined with something like Perkeep’s permanodes.

I also like the idea of email/productivity apps as the killer app for this system. One of the reasons I use <a href="http://amazingmarvin.com">amazingmarvin.com</a> as my task manager right now is that it essentially has a gallery of different workflow “strategies” that you can try out on yourself over time. But of course these are all centrally implemented, and I fear for the combinatorial madness that their dev team has to maintain. Something like that where you could build your own workflow strategies would be hard to resist for a lot of hackers.

I'd be fascinated to learn of the IPFS cycle problem! I had to deal with similar problems with cycles in FRP user interface construction

Steve, with regard to your mission:<br/><br/>&gt; Enable all people to modify the software they use in the course of using it.<br/><br/>How do you weight the two halves? Do you care about people being able to modify their OS? Their programming language? Their firmware? :stuck_out_tongue:<br/><br/><em>(Cross-link: <a href="../thinking-together/1545387390.005400.html#1545416565.019000">../thinking-together/1.545416.html&hellip;</a>)</em>
