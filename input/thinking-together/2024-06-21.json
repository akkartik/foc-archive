Greatly appreciated that you did it, at this point I'm just too tired to push against majorities in some group which has very different goals. What I read into the question is this:\n\n• one future of coding might be that we're all going to do much more coding. And invent, reinvent, many techniques for many different personal or proprietary systems\/environments, for the odd chance that one might become popular\/successful or to prove\/promote another point. But all of these separate and incompatible, and after many years, maybe one little thing gets adopted elsewhere, or not. Inventing even more languages that have a set of features but not another set, so if you switch from one to gain some benefits, you do it at the loss of other features + sunken cost into the prior environment. While at the same time, it's just far too much work for any single individual to do all\/enough of it, but by being very busy doing my own silo\/duplication, not joining anybody else's, it's a lot of wheel reinvention and duplication.\n• another future of coding is one where more of the things created become reusable, compatible, mixable, to get some benefits\/savings from synergies, reuse.\nI can easily imagine that the 2nd \"future\" is not a goal\/interest for many. To the contrary, specifically here to do more of, or their, or another competing\/duplicating, variant of future option 1. These two are not mutually exclusive, but I don't see a whole lot of benefit\/improvement coming from the competing\/duplicating piles of option 1 projects (too many to even look\/review these, far less to reuse, if one could in the first place), and I don't see much done towards option 2. Given there's lots and lots of people around doing their respective own projects, but there might be not much shared goals (or different conflicting strategies to get to the goal, unorganized, non-coordinated, not practically collaborating), just a vague overlap of lowest-common-denominator (as type 1 doesn't have much interest nor sees much benefit beyond that). It is far easier to just work on your own personal project and ignore everything else, and remains a harder problem, too expensive or technically or legally prohibitive to mix\/reuse other people's work (because per type 1 is not designed to, this was\/is not their goal).\n\nMaybe you did not have this in mind, but it's a hard problem that remains, and I don't see how a future of coding is much interesting or greatly beneficial if most of the work\/effort is sunken into repeated duplication\/reinvention, results trapped\/stuck in this dead end (to then be rediscovered and duplicated all over again).",

It’s easier to find a single individual who contributes their time and effort to move something forward single-handedly (like <@UCUSW7WVD> did with collecting all these manifestos) than it is to align multiple people to commit to the same values, at least for long enough to move something forward together. Unless “collaboration” means I put some project on GitHub and you like it so much that you contribute exactly what I needed, avoiding any arguments.\n\nThe really interesting things happen when a group of people with at least slightly if not dramatically different values and priorities get together and manage to come to some sort of agreement. It doesn’t have to be consensus, but maybe there are some principles in some order of priority that most (not necessarily all) people in that group can agree on. Then you have a manifesto that is worth the name. Before that, it’s just opinions.\n\nWhat I would like to suggest is to take that list and get as many people from here as are willing to do so together into some kind of room — perhaps virtual, perhaps even physical, perhaps for a synchronous discussion, perhaps just some temporary asynchronous thread — where we try to come up with something that most (not necessarily all) who are in the room can agree on.\n\nThis is not an easy process. Because it’s a messy social process and not a problem waiting for a technological solution. And let’s face it, we’re all much better trained in dealing with the latter than with the former. Openness is needed. Compromises will be required. Freedoms will be limited. That’s what it takes to commit to a shared direction.\nOne meeting will not be enough. It would have to start with individuals presenting their perspective and others to listen until we all understand where everybody is coming from. Then we can start to argue about what is more and less important and how we should phrase it in a statement that represents the group. To a certain extend you will have to learn to love the process and let go of the result, at least for a while.\n\nMaybe the result will not be good enough. Maybe the whole thing will be a blood-bath. Maybe some people will leave the group mid-process. Maybe new friends or enemies will be made in the process. But chances are that most of those involved will take something away from it, even if we don’t end up with something like the Agile Manifesto in the end.\n\nI find it highly unlikely that a significant enough number of people would be interested in seriously attempting this. Maybe you like the idea but just don’t have the capacity at the moment. And capacity it will take. That’s fine. I just want to raise my hand and say that I’m willing to try this, seriously, and I’m available, and I’d like to support such a process where I can.\n\nI’m not going to volunteer to drive this process though. I have my own skin in the game and I think it’s better if somebody who doesn’t steers it; I could potentially find someone who can help with moderation\/mediation, who is skilled at exactly that, but doesn’t know anything about programming, if people think that’s useful. I consider moderation\/mediation and driving the process different things, which can be (but don’t have to be) done by different people.",
