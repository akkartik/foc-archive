Galileo championed Copernican cosmology (which raises the question of why don’t we call it Galilean cosmology?).\n1. Galileo would never in a million years dream of championing anyone else. He was a renaissance man when it came to self-promotion and exercising privilege. The phrase <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Copernican_principle|\"Copernican principle\"> was only coined in the 1950s.\n2. In fact, in the early 1600s there were *7* competing models of the cosmos. And Ptolemy's model was still the one to beat! We moderns also know that the errors in it that led people to look for alternatives were in fact caused by transcription errors over 2000 years.\n3. Copernicus's model had epicycles! More epicycles than Ptolemy's!\n4. The ancients were more aware of the ideas of heliocentrism than we moderns are of the ideas of (strong, empirical) geocentrism.\nI'm getting all my information from <https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140310031503\/http:\/\/tofspot.blogspot.com\/2013\/08\/the-great-ptolemaic-smackdown.html>, which seems an _excellent_ series.",

What can destroy your theory that FoCers can make sensible problem statements? What if their problems seem to be ill-defined? What if their problems seem to lead in unpopular directions? I think that the epitome of FoC is to think-outside-of-the-box. I think that Galileo did just that but was rewarded with house arrest. You assume that your question leads to honest answers, but, what if it doesn’t? What if responders hold back or can’t express in words what they think that the problem is?

Your (1) is that you think that people in FoC can state in one sentence (or one paragraph) succinctly what problem that they are trying to solve.  What is part (2)? What can destroy your theory that FoCers can make sensible problem statements? What if their problems seem to be ill-defined? What if their problems seem to lead in unpopular directions? I think that the epitome of FoC is to think-outside-of-the-box. I think that Galileo did just that but was rewarded with house arrest. You assume that your question leads to honest answers, but, what if it doesn’t? What if responders hold back or can’t express in words what they think that the problem is? What if they aren’t able to verbalize their problem statement(s) - they just “intuit” a problem a chase after it?"
