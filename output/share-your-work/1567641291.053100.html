Boy is Kartik right about that! When I suggested the other day in a Reddit forum that one could measure, approximately, the error propensity of a language, and the mean time to repair by someone other than the author i was practically tarred and feathered. Programmers may be mostly unique like snowflakes, but if you put a bunch of programmers on the same exact task, and give them different tools, their productivity will be wildly different. I once worked a huge project for IBM. They needed a sequel to their very popular DisplayWrite 4 word processor because WordPerfect will killing them, and in previous decades under Thomas J Watson Jr, there was a practice in IBM that any important project was done by 3 different labs, and the winner with the first/best product, depending on what they were after, would get promotions and staff expansions, and the losing lab would be shuffled a bit like a losing soccer team. A very radical approach that kept internal competition at a high pitch, even when IBM was in its day a giant monopoly. Because IBM is only a mere shadow of its former greatness people don't understand how radical a structure IBM followed, with its technical ladder paying as well as the sales ladder. Who else does this in modern times? Anyway the three teams used different languages and different approaches, and my firm used Modula-2 while the others used C, and we kicked their butts, because Modula-2 is a far superior language to C, particularly as the code grows to large size. More companies should try the multiple team approach. Nothing stimulates human performance like a fair competition, where the stakes are high, but the playing field is level. And to bring it back to Kartik's point, the Academics don't have much at stake in their projects,  and often don't care if anyone uses any of their stuff. These category theorists really drive me over the bend. Please show me how functors make my tictactoe game easier to write and easier to understand...
