Oh, you guys might want to look at MPL. The concurrent part of MPL is like session types, probably isomorphic, but it seemed more intuitive to me than session types. Not that it was easy to learn about - MPL is an idea from my professor who has poor communication skills... it took me four months to figure out what he was talking about, but once I figured it out I wrote this document: <a href="http://loyc.net/2015/mpl.html">http://loyc.net/2015/mpl.html</a>
