I want to pick up <a href="../thinking-together/1603601936.277700.html">this earlier thread</a> about Christopher Alexander, where I promised to let those interested know when something is coming up. It doesn't feel right to spam this group with all the details as that's arguably borderline off-topic, so I've been looking for a good way to have a discussion with those all-in on Alexander elsewhere. This will also enable me to bring people together across a few different communities.<br/><br/>Recently, I had a good experience with a pop-up Telegram chat group that was hosted temporarily after an online event for further discussion. This seems like a good light-weight format for the purpose I have in mind. There's no great master plan, just a few little ideas I'd like to develop further with you.<br/><br/>If you are interested in upcoming activities around Christopher Alexander, his magnum opus <em>The Nature of Order</em>, and how to apply his theories to other domains (software and technology in particular), I'd like to invite you to join me here: <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/RaDQv_BGCm7OcPaP">https://t.me/joinchat/RaDQv_BGCm7OcPaP</a><br/><br/>This is a low-volume announcement-ish channel if you just want to stay up to date on what's happening. And there is a linked chat if you want to engage in a more active capacity â€” asking questions, discussing concepts, suggesting ideas, and more.<br/>Looking forward to seeing you there!

couldn'T you create a "of-design patterns" Channel I think that could be ok?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andreas S.</span> I thought about it, but then having the ability to invite people from several different communities seemed more valuable to me. If you don't feel it's worth following yet another channel on yet another platform, that's ok and I totally understand. I'm sure whatever will happen over there will likely at some point make its way around back here in some form or another.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> The Nature of Order seems very interesting, going to read it so thanks for the heads up.<br/><br/>I intuitively have had somewhat similar ideas about order and the natural formation of systems, I struggle to even articulate most of my ideas on it, so this seems like a rabbit-hole waiting for me!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Fred</span> - I recommend starting off with C.A.'s Notes on The Synthesis of Form. It takes technical topic of design, form, and function, and orients it around human value, but on a technical way such that the form and design of things is derived directly from the human / natural needs (as opposed to being a "good" design for artificial reasons)
