I would be excited to participate in such an event, but I'd be much more interested in a symposium or some other forum where the attendees were all actively working in the space.

Can you elaborate on the distinction between a conference vs symposium?

I'd say conference lacks communication between speakers / attendees whereas symposium focuses more on exchange of ideas? I have spoken at conferences and I feel 1) you need to cut more niche / deep contents to accommodate all attendees 2) conversations can only happen in the 10 min breaks or after party and many attendees don't even get the chance to chat with speakers in more depth.<br/><br/>If I'm presenting I'd be very happy to assume attendees are excited about the same kind of ideas I'm interested in, and to know I can have a deeper than over-the-beer conversations afterwards with them.

I was at the Programming Synthesis conference last week, which maybe was more like a symposium. I would say there were ~50 folks there and ~20 spoke either for a few minutes or longer sessions. I think it would be fun to design a smallish conference (fewer than 100, perhaps as few as 50), and have each person speak for perhaps 2 minutes each, about what they are working on/most passionate about. That way you maximize the odds of everyone connecting with the people most relevant to their work, and you can spend most time in conversation and less time sitting in seats  listening

The Programming Synthesis conference very much felt like it was headed that way, and I would go full throttle in that direction (no talks longer than 5 minutes, perhaps maybe a 10 minute keynote or too)

Sorry, this thread is now two weeks old but, yes, I think of a symposium as being more peers getting together to share their thoughts instead of a presenter/audience kind of environment.

I'd be eager to spend more time with people who are doing the work and talking "shop" rather than listening to people trying to market their results.
