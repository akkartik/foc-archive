Hello everyone!<br/><br/>I'm currently doing a Master degree in Dublin, Ireland; before that I used to work at a startup in China for quite a few years as a software developer. They've had great ambitions of revolutionize the current computer-assisted learning situation, but they made a series of bad decision at bad timings, got hit with China's brutal lockdown policy, and eventually gradually fell off; and now I alone carry on with their ideal.<br/><br/>Back in the startup a big topic we tried to work on was to improve the production and the distribution process of educational materials, which led me to research about different ways of content authoring, which include end-user programming things à la HyperCard and Authorware, which itself eventually puts Future of Coding on my radar.<br/><br/>I've been aware of Future of Coding for nearly a year now but decided not to reach out until now. I'm looking forward to meet more like-minded people and possibly work on things together - although my current focus has shifted a lot due to real life circumstances, that dream of using computers to change education for the better isn't something that I'm willing to give up.<br/><br/>Thank you all and have a good day!
