Over the last couple years, I've been playing with a handful of flow-based programming tools and prototyping my own. My main interest is in tools that make programming more accessible to everyone, especially those without technical backgrounds. I believe that the flow paradigm is intuitive and flexible enough to become a mainstream interface that everyone can use to manage their data, devices, etc.\n\nI started working as a fullstack eng at <http:\/\/Parabola.io|Parabola.io> just a couple months ago. It's a web-based flow tool for connecting and processing data from a wide range of other cloud platforms. Think flow programming meets IFTTT meets Excel. It's been an interesting shift in mindset, going from daydreaming about a flowy future to building a product that needs to solve practical needs for users! :slightly_smiling_face: It's a fun challenge, and I hope to share a few insights in the future!\n\nHopefully you'll see me jump into some conversations around Slack and Twitter. And if you're playing with Parabola, I'd love to know what you think. Please reach out if you need a hand with anything (tech issues, feature requests, pricing, etc)",
