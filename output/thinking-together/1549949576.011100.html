I just watched a demo (link below) of the Glamorous Toolkit, and I love what I'm seeing! The philosophy is using an IDE that is completely moldable to the thing being developed ("system oriented" vs "language oriented"), and full integration between code, documentation, tests, etc.<br/><br/>Kudos to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tudor Girba</span> for creating it! I hope it does a lot to change the way people think about software.<br/><br/><a href="https://youtu.be/o5VEoKEUx9A">https://youtu.be/o5VEoKEUx9A</a>

Thanks for the kind words. Indeed, Glamorous Toolkit embodies a new approach to developing software that we call moldable development. It's not only a tool, but a new way of thinking about software.<br/><br/>The root of it comes from the realization that software is shapeless, but we as humans need a form, a shape, to reason about anything. The shape of software is provided by the tools we use. This makes tools be essential. However, until now, our tools were dominated by the shape of the input format. That is why most IDEs show text because that happens to be the input format. Or when a visual representation is offered, it is tied to the visual input language (such as in dataflow interfaces).<br/><br/>Software is at least data, if not live objects. As such, we can put any shape on that data. And it turns out that if we control that shape, we can dramatically affect both our performance, and our enjoyment. That is why we built an environment that is moldable first.<br/><br/>And the idea of moldable development is to build a tool for every problem we encounter. To make this practical, the cost of tools must be cheap. We target minutes cheap and the construction of the tools can happen live as you program. Interestingly, this results in explainable software whose details that can literally be understood by non-technical people. I gave a talk a year ago about how this works using the old generation of GT: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbQVIrca6CA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbQVIrca6CA</a><br/><br/>Glamorous Toolkit also comes with a couple of engines. Perhaps the most interesting one is the one that replaces TDD with example-driven development. Examples have assertions, like tests, but they also return an object. This little change has significant implications in that the object can be used as documentation especially when combined with custom views.

Also, while I am often seen talking about it, it's really a long term team effort. You can see the current team here: <a href="https://feenk.com">https://feenk.com</a>
