1. The medium should be communal and accessible. People should learn and collaborate through awareness, with no assumption of a single, isolated user sitting at a laptop with a keyboard and mouse. (the humane medium , I love it!)<br/><br/>2. The medium should allow people to think with their bodies, because we are more than fingers and hands. (cognitive science!)<br/><br/>3. The medium should expand peopleâ€™s agency and liberate their creativity; rather than being an app with a limited set of features defined by a corporation and imposed on people (agency and creativity - also what is the relationship of my tech with corporations)
