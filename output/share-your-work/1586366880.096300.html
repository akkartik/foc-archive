I admire how thorough you are, but the reality is that there are tons of posts on this topic and its unlikely people are going to read all of this... So concision is important. Here's something I wrote recently -- not quite my "principles" but I think they have a higher change of being read and understood: <a href="https://www.notion.so/d948a936dce64832893fac481149b8d5">https://www.notion.so/d948a936dce64832893fac481149b8d5</a>

In section 5, i would suggest that instead of recommending tests which are extra work, you instead recommend building scaffolding permanently into the software. For example in my chess program i have a flag that lets you set up a position that allows easy testing of the trickiest features of the game, such as castling the king or en passant capturing. This saves time during user testing.<br/><br/>section 7, i would emphasize that comments relating to function formal parameters are far more important than any other comments. Many people use short names for parameters, and unless you know what the parameter is for, it makes it very hard to read. If you are going to only comment a little bit, spend it on the parameters.<br/><br/>Some of your comments about performance are no longer true. For example, <tt>JS</tt> is now nearly as fast as <tt>C</tt> due to the incredible V8 engine. In many cases today the programs we run are dominated by time spent in the OS or underlying platform. In a web browser for example there is a huge overhead for each tab, often tens of megabytes, far more than our own programs. Gone are the days of low overhead operating systems; everything is a sweathog now outside of embedded systems.<br/><br/>I also think that just tossing your readers into Functional programming without justifying it is unsound. Nested for-loops are superior to <tt>Map/filter</tt> because they can  be interrupted while Map cannot. <tt>Map</tt> is merely an encapsulation of a <tt>for-loop</tt> and thus is merely syntactic sugar as they call it, that also happens to remove the ability to stop precisely. You may be traversing a 2D array and want to stop on a match. How does one do that with Map? You can't. So <tt>for-loops</tt> are not an endangered species. In fact all of the primitive instructions as envisioned by the earliest pioneers such as arithmetic, 2-way and N-way branching, call/return, looping, will never go away; nothing wrong with learning them

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@William Taysom</span> APL and its other "array language" descendants such as J and K failed in the marketplace in part because of their inability to stop on demand. A FOR loop that is presented in the language as the preferred looping mechanism is a straitjacket. This is also one of the reasons dataflow languages never get out of their little ghetto, because unlike A/V signal processing and a few other purely stream oriented processing tasks where there is no stopping, most of the real world is about looking for things and stopping at some point; maybe because the user only requested the first 100 records, or because the program realizes that something has gone wrong and it is time stop. If you have enough nesting the amount of unnecessary work could be considerable.  It also common in nested loops to exit out an outer loop on some condition; this is not available with the atomic map operation which considers the loop as one atomic action. I call this problem "insufficient granularity", and in the paragon language linked recently by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Will Crichton</span> you can see they have an iterate across node operatopm, but no conditions attached to the loop.  This type of language construction is maddening to the users, because when you prevent something in the syntax it boxes you in. It is so tempting in new language design to want to eliminate the historical primitive operations, so as to become "higher level". I think this is one of the reasons why many of these no-code/low code projects are fated to be niche products.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@David Piepgrass</span> Nice blog post :slightly_smiling_face:, it must have taken some time to write it!<br/><br/>As others mentioned, I also feel it could use some "introduction" up front -&gt; it talks about principles of programming, but then quickly gets into something specific and it is hard to see from there what is coming next or when it is coming.<br/>This first part, about making a tool where you end up extracting a function -&gt; it feels like it should be a chapter of its own. You could call it Seeing Through The Eye of the Tool Writer if you wish or smth, but it feels like more than just introduction.<br/><br/>Also, I agree blog post could benefit from list of these principles upfront, just to give us an idea of what we are getting into.<br/><br/>If I would be nitpicking, I would say that WithoutSuffix method should be named RemoveSuffix -&gt; WithoutSuffix sounds like it checks if there is such suffix and returns bool.<br/><br/>Most of stuff sounds fine to me otherwise, easy to agree with! But that is also because it is pretty general. At the end if I had to recap couple of main thoughts I got from this, it would be hard, because there was a lot of things said and everything felt similarly important. What if you could summarize each chapter/principle into one or two sentences that are the "takeaway" for that principle?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@magicmouse94937</span><br/>I wrote a B+tree for JavaScript (sorted-btree on npm) a couple of years ago. I performed various optimizations based on microbenchmarks and beat out competing libraries. Still, it was much slower than my more complex B+ tree (an AList B+tree) in C#; the C# version should have been slower if the languages were the same speed. An optimized JS engine offers tricks to let you get closer to native speed, but in general, you can't expect to get close to native speed.<br/><br/>I guess I failed to mention a major benefit of tests: making your app safe for changes. You want to be able to change things and see if you broke something major without <b>any</b> manual testing. Facebook's motto is "move fast and break things" but it's not literally OK for devs to break Facebook - but if FB has comprehensive tests, devs can be trusted to change things more. Your suggestion sound like just making it easier to do manual tests?<br/><br/>Oh and I specifically said <em>nested</em> for-loops, not for-loops in general. And my B+tree for JavaScript gives you higher-order functions that <b>can</b> stop, so no, stopping is not a feature unique to for-loops. Besides, I was talking about the <em>order</em> of teaching things, not whether they should be taught at all.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Martin Sosic</span> If it returned bool, it would have been called HasSuffix. I didn't call it RemoveSuffix because it doesn't actually remove the suffix, it creates a new string without the suffix. While C# strings are immutable, keep in mind that mutable strings remain common in the PL landscape (C++ and Ruby)

I think the name StripSuffix is better than WIthoutSuffix. The action is to strip, and "Strip" is a verb while WithoutSuffix is an adjective. Usually better in general to use verbs to describe an action that is going to be taken.

<tt>Strip</tt> has the same issue as <tt>Remove</tt>, and <tt>Without</tt> is not an adjective.<br/><br/>I also use <tt>With</tt>/<tt>Without</tt> in my semi-persistent data structures, e.g. my <tt>MMap&lt;Key,Value&gt;</tt> type has mutating <tt>Add</tt> and <tt>Remove</tt> methods, but also <tt>With</tt> and <tt>Without</tt> to create a copy of the map with or without a given key-value pair. <a href="http://core.loyc.net/collections/hashtrees.html">http://core.loyc.net/collections/hashtrees.html</a><br/><br/>Similarly in my <tt>sorted-btree</tt> package on npm, it's got mutating <tt>set</tt> and <tt>delete</tt> plus non-mutating <tt>with</tt>, <tt>without</tt>, <tt>withKeys</tt> , <tt>withoutKeys</tt> , etc. In any programming language where mutability is common, it makes sense to use different naming for copying vs mutating methods, and this is of course doubly true when the mutating and non-mutating methods are on the same type!<br/><br/>Ruby solves this with the <tt>!</tt> suffix on mutating methods, but most languages don't have an option like that.
