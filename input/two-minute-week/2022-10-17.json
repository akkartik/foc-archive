What I'd like to see in tools like Sonic Pi, is the ability to record and play back a session like this.  Too often moments in live performances are lost to whatever the state was at the time; but having a slider and a way to go back to a given point would be a really nice feature.  Of course, with animation, you have to time-stamp each change, and there may be issues with having everything turn out exactly the same.  But it would still be a really useful feature.",
