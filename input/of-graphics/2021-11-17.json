If the focus starts away from the point marked with the arrow, the directions can be assigned by remembering where the focus came from, and then choosing one edge at the time of the remaining quadrants .... (if that makes sense....).\n\nBut if the focus starts on the marked item, what does \"up\" mean? For this particular example, my intuition says \"up goes to the closest point\", but not sure how that would generalize to any other configuration ... :thinking_face:",

If the focus starts away from the point marked with the arrow, the directions can be assigned by remembering where the focus came from, and then choosing one edge at the time of the remaining quadrants .... (if that makes sense....).\n\nBut if the focus starts on the marked item, what does \"up\" mean?
