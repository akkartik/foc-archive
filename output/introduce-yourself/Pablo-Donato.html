Hello everyone!<br/><br/>I'm Pablo, a first-year French PhD student based in Paris. I have a background in theoretical comp-sci, more specifically in logic, proof theory, and programming language theory. I'm doing my thesis under the supervision of Benjamin Werner, who already introduced himself in this channel yesterday :)<br/><br/>I have been following the FoC podcasts and weekly newsletter for almost two years, and always found the discussions and findings of the community very enlightening and motivating. There is such a feeling of validation when you discover that there is a whole community of like-minded people, who share similar vision and core values in the way they dream about the future of computing ^^<br/><br/>My long-term ambition is to help bringing together centuries of deep philosophical and mathematical knowledge about logic, and decades of experimentations and insights in the design of ergonomic human-computer interfaces. The ultimate goal being to build a solid foundation for a renewed science of programming, that focuses more on the human and social aspects of systems building. Yes, I might be too big of a dreamer, even for the FoC community :sweat_smile:<br/><br/>To conclude this lengthy introduction on a more concrete note: we are currently working with Benjamin and collaborators on the design of a new kind of graphical interface for proof assistants, based on the direct manipulation of mathematical objects and formulas. We may soon be able to share a very early version of our web-based prototype. We will then be eager to get feedback and insights from the FoC community! As a little teaser, I recently discovered that there may be a formal <em>Curry-Howard correspondence</em> between our work, and the one of Conal Elliott on tangible functional programming... Stay tuned for more info!
