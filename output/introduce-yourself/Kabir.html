Hey everyone! I'm <a href="https://kabir.sh">Kabir</a>, a junior in high school. I worked at <a href="https://webflow.com">Webflow</a> this past summer and had the opportunity to hack on some very cool things that definitely would belong here :eyes:. For me, what started as an interest in compilers and programming language theory spiraled into the urge to make something more consistent and expressive than the programming environments we have today. I've been following a lot of interesting projects for the past few years, and they eventually led me here! Super happy that there's a thriving community centered around this space :slightly_smiling_face:
