This week in code faster. Unlike last week, my post did not go viral. What a difference! Not viral means ~500 views, viral means 18k (36x!). Beginner tutorials have much better virality because of their wider appeal, and there's some luck involved. However, there are some ideas about jq I want to write about to finish up my "mastering jq" series. After this, I'll try writing some basic tutorials to various unix commands (sed, xargs, grep, etc.) and see if other people find them more valuable. It's a lot more fun to write about advanced techniques, but as JZ said, "If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be lyrically Talib Kweli. Truthfully I want to rhyme like Common Sense (but I did 5 mil). I ain't been rhyming like Common since"
