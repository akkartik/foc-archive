Despite the click-bait/culture war title, this video is quite good:<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr3quGh7pJA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr3quGh7pJA</a><br/>... and everything it has to say about music theory also applies to our default notational conventions.<br/><br/>(I would add, perhaps controversially, that most of the same things are true of our mathematical notation.)

Adam started to make click-baiting headlines. That’s bad :disappointed:

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@fetis</span> Scanning over recent uploads, it looks like this is the only click-bait title... and it's a self-aware joke

Yeah, fantastic video.<br/><br/>I feel like Adam has always been a little clickbait-y when it comes to titles and (especially) thumbnails, but insofar as that's YouTuber culture I can easily forgive it, since his essays are so consistently stellar.

Title baityness aside*, Adam earns it with many FoC relevant ideas to unpack before zeroing in on the conclusion.<br/><br/>With programming, much of the debate seems to be at the level of Catholic (Imperative) vs Protestant (Functional) at most, and Calvinists (Semicolons) vs Arminianism (Commas) more often.  I'm sad that we don't have a thoroughly developed, independent of programming practice.  Where I encounter independence, it's not so well developed — or I just don't get out enough despite trying.<br/><br/>"Math is math" — So happens, I was just writing about how a problem with the legacy of the Euclid is that the axiom, definition, theorem structure for pedagogy is backward.  The formal decomposition into Elements is what you get at the end of inquiry, but it's not a good fit for developing new mathematical ideas (except as a destination) or good for getting up to speed as a student.  This line of reflection ends up connecting to "embodied cognition," but more on that would be too much of a tangent.<br/><br/><li> I'm coming at this from the perspective of one who would be keen to learn a music theory that only and rigorously accounts for Bach.  I mean my iTunes ("Music") window at this moment reads "Bach: Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1 - Prelude &amp; Fugue #9 In E, BWV 854		2:32	András Schiff	Bach: The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1 [Disc 1]	Classical	0	7."<br/><br/>I'm also a guy to leaves the club knowing I'd like the beats better with counterpoint salted on top.  (Probably comes from playing to video games as a kid.)<br/><br/>(I did find myself asking how is gender or race is as relevant ethnicity, but in as much as race and gender influence a person's perspective on many aspects culture, music and by extension the structural understanding thereof will surely be influenced as well.)

In my view, maths comes from textiles, and textiles comes from everywhere.
