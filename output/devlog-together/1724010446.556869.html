Quick aside on "the making of" <a href="../thinking-together/1724009682.290899.html">the FoC starmap</a>. I've been reading Christopher Alexander's "The Nature of Order". I'm 250 pages (so 1/8th of the way) in, but I tried to make each node (problem statement) a "center" as CA defines it.<br/><br/>Initially I wanted distances to be meaningful but I couldn't see a way to make it work, so they're mostly meaningless (except for a couple of nodes with very few edges). Instead I ended up focusing on angles. I tried to make every edge unambiguously go to a specific node, and this had the effect of improving use of all 360 degrees around every node.<br/><br/>I started out putting myself in the center, but eventually realized it was better to start with people who had the most 1s and 2s (for the most part the only edges shown in these graphs).
