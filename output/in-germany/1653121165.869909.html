Yeah, my German is good enough to live/hang out with friends, but not good enough to intelligently talk about the future of coding.  I saw several people from Berlin just browsing around the Slack last week - maybe once everyone funnels in we could organize a meetup?  A couple of pizzas/case of a beer or mate.  Wouldn't know where to host though - if there is some public space we could reserve for free.
