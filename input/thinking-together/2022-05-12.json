Now, search engines have gotten notably worse in the past few years, so maybe we'll see the momentum shift back to personal, butler-like agents that go out and fetch things. Unfortunately, the web is not a great place for getting semantic data, and Web 3.0 was so irrelevant it means something completely different now. Take advertisements off the web and you'll have a much more amenable ecosystem, though I'm fairly sure that will never happen, so maybe it's time to start thinking of something new.",

Now, search engines have gotten notably worse in the past few years, so maybe we'll see the momentum shift back to personal, butler-like agents that go out and fetch things. Unfortunately, the web is not a great place for getting semantic data, and Web 3.0 was so irrelevant it means something completely different now. Take advertisements off the web and you'll have a much more amenable ecosystem, though I'm fairly sure that will never happen, so maybe it's time to start thinking of something new."
