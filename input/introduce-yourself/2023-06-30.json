I am currently between jobs, but I worked as a game developer before, mainly on gameplay and UI areas.\n\nSince I finished university around 6 years ago I am interested in exploring all the facets of software development and interested in moving the discipline forward. My personal project is working on tooling that can visualize existing text-based code in visual format, and I am generally interested in code visualization and software comprehension. I am also fond of topics related to software architecture, design, domain languages and programming language design. Other than that in my jobs I  worked with various desktop and js\/web based UI frameworks, proprietary game engines, databases, small scale webservers, and I helped in writing a package manager for a company, and a codebase migration tool. For non-programming related topics I love learning about psychology, philosophy, history, and I love comics :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nI just found this community, and I am really excited to discuss these topics with others who are also interested in them. I would love to find a job where I can work on these or at least contribute to them in my free time.",
