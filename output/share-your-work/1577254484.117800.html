One of the big questions every next-gen language has to face sooner or later, is: Is it a suitable replacement for any of the top 3 languages in use which are JavaScript, Java, and Python?   Those languages have huge entrenched user bases; with tons of code, examples, and libraries. I don't think you can find a higher risk project than tackling any of those 3 languages head-on, but hey isn't that the job of the future of coding group, to spawn the replacement for these ancient yet powerful languages?  If we can't topple one or more of these giant towers of code, are we making any significant progress?<br/><br/>As as test case i took a very small Python program that draws a little tree, and recoded it in the Beads language, and did a comparison of the complexity of the API calls used to create the program. This is a subjective task of course, as assigning points to various API calls is debatable, but one has to at least make a stab at measurement, because without measurement there is no science; just fad and fashion. The two programs are really quite different, and I think just this tiny example shows the vast gulf between notations. The detailed comparison is at <a href="https://github.com/magicmouse/beads-examples/blob/master/Example%20-%20Xmas%20Tree/docs/comparison_with_python.md">https://github.com/magicmouse/beads-examples/blob/master/Exa&hellip;</a>

err.. the popularity of those 3 languages at this point is NOT a function of their design. You can easily make a language nowadays which objectively is better than 1 of those languages along some metric, and achieve zero traction.

Want to make a language more popular than one of those big languages? Best bet probably is to jump in with some big tech corp or some other tech movement at the right  time, and have your language sponsored by them. Nothing else even comes close in potential to beat those languages in popularity

Inertia is a powerful force. Popularity also means folks have used it in all kinds of use cases and you're likely to find libraries an integrations with everything else out there.<br/><br/>I use Python a lot and the multithreading solution seems like overkill for this problem. BTW you can actually write the multiline literal with <tt>\</tt> in Python like so: <tt>r'''hello \ hello'''</tt>.  Looks like Beads has some kind of built in loop timer (loom_timer)? Maybe writing this in pygame would get closer to what Beads does.<br/><br/>If we think of subsuming the existing languages rather than replacing them, I think we have a better chance of something new catching on. What I mean is instead of providing a just a language - you provide a larger system that integrates other features such as a distributed database. This creates the other concern here that this becomes a 'misfit' in the current ecosystem, however if the value proposition is large I think folks will actually start using it. Of the listed features of Beads, the most interesting to me are the graph database and reversible debugging. Would love to see how this works. These are hard to show in comparison of text programs snippets though.

Javascript was a mandated monopoly; Java had huge backing from Sun Microsystems. Python has steadily grown without a corporate sponsor purely on merit i believe. It's significant indenting syntax saves about 13% character count, which is why i adopted it in Beads. I understand it has benefited greatly recently due to the massive popularity of ML tools like TensorFlow which revolve around Python.<br/><br/>The existing languages need to be replaced for the simple reason their computational model is archaic. Wedded deeply to the asymmetries and imperfections of the Intel and ARM instruction sets which together control 99% of all computers sold today. If you look at Excel, it offers a completely different virtual machine than Intel. It offers sparse matrices, protected arithmetic, and easy layout (provided it fits a grid structure).  Excel also have sophisticated computational support for things like backsolving (although hardly any users know to use to this feature). I feel the battle is one to supplant both Excel and the top 3 languages, in one tool that finally bridges these two almost uncommunicating realms.

I agree that those are good questions wrt languages, but if the goal to empower users, is it safe to assume the ideal artifact that serves that purpose will take the form of a language?<br/><br/>If you were to ask a user how they’d like to interact with a computer to accomplish their goals (short of some magic AI genie), would we expect them to tell us they want to write something we’d recognize as code?<br/><br/>For example, are spreadsheets or HyperCard “languages”?

&gt;  the ideal artifact that serves that purpose will take the form of a language?<br/>Excellent question! The current programming world view takes as its base assumption a workflow where you 'write the program as a ~text language' and then 'submit it' to the computer to run. Can this workflow itself be twisted around to something else, rather than just the language piece of this jigsaw puzzle replaced with a different language piece? Tomas Petricek's write-up talks about this also I think: <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/programming-interaction/">http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/programming-interaction/</a>

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Dekorte</span> Unquestionably Excel is a programming language with a visual shell. The language has many innovative properties, such as a closed, protected arithmetic, where undefined quantities ripple through the system without crashing (unlike programs in almost every other language), etc. The environment has an automatic variable naming system using A5, B3, etc., which has the further property that when you insert a new column, all of the labels are automatically fixed up. This is the semantic implication of a column insert on the underlying code. The end user is not particularly aware of the underlying language until they write a formula or create a VBA function which exposes the naked underbelly of the language that drives the system. Since a range of cells has a visual representation, it is possible to create simple sheets with some SUM functions without typing a single character. So one could say they have perfected the visual aids because they have minimized textual interactions.<br/><br/>The supposed dichotomy between text and graphical forms is an illusion that constantly comes up in this discussion group. If you look back at the history of mathematics, and most particularly to the time when Newton and Leibniz were inventing calculus, you will see that Newton, in order to prove that his calculus worked, had to write all these letters and demonstrate geometrical proofs of his work, because that's what people could understand. Subsequently, some famous mathematician proved that all of geometry can be represented in algebra.  I don't care which node and wire product you show me, i can remap the geometry of that product into algebra (which is textual) and textual transformations of that algebra. In fact, since a computer is a one-dimensional stream of opcodes, if your software runs on a computer it had to be mapped at some point to the symbolic algebra of the Intel or ARM instruction set.<br/> I have seen multi-million dollar budget projects flounder in the FoC space caused in part by the team focusing on the graphical interface before they defined their backend algebra. When you click and drag an object you are performing an algebraic operation that can be represented in text. If you haven't figured out the grammar, verbs, nouns, and semantics of your back-end language first, you will thrash around, because the limits of your underlying algebra will inevitably push back up into the higher layers.<br/><br/>If you want to build a sturdy house, you gotta build from the bottom up; laying the foundation first. Putting in the windows before the concrete is poured is frankly crazy. That being said, one has to design from both ends, and have a vision of the final product. This is what makes creating a new language so tricky, especially when you want to have a graphical front end.

Agreed that you have to build the foundations first of the language but with the end goal in site. I think one of the big things I see in designing languages is that a lot of research is experimentation without a known end goal. How many projects here have a clear end goal?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@magicmouse94937</span> “The supposed dichotomy between text and graphical is an illusion...”<br/><br/>Sure, but text <b>is</b> graphical with respect to bits, and involves a lot of computation and memory spent transforming the underlying bits into something more digestible to our limited minds. Theoretically, a computer only needs a single output bit (say, a light that can be on or off) and single input bit (say, a keyboard with 0 and 1 buttons) and everything else is a practical accommodation for our cognitive and physical limitations, but it’s in those accommodations that computers become useful.<br/><br/>Would Photoshop be as useful if users had to type code to create images - entering the coordinates of each operation as numbers instead of using direct manipulation? Technically, they’re equivalent, but one moves more memory and computational load off the user and into the computer (depending on the type of operation).<br/><br/>I know you’re not disagreeing with the above, and are instead criticizing the visual programming approach that has forgotten this. Node &amp; line is often assumed to decrease cognitive load, even in cases where it doesn’t - which is almost all. Photoshop wouldn’t be improved if one had to input the coordinates of the paint operations with nodes &amp; lines (vs a direct manipulation paintbrush) though it might be useful for defining simple filters, in the limited cases where they more closely resemble our mental models of those filters.

Actually photoshop is a huge collection of graphical manipulation subroutines that have a more user friendly front-end that lets you control via sliders and text entry fields the parameters to these magical functions which do some devious operation on the underlying channels of the image. I count over 500 different custom dialog boxes in Photoshop. Although one selects things and certainly one uses the mouse to track position when drawing, the vast bulk of Photoshop skill by users is not direct manipulation based, but learning how to use all those dialog boxes with their super tricky underlying function in the right order. I would venture to guess that Photoshop has the most PhD thesis content of any software product on earth, and is one of the most clever and difficult to copy software products. I could easily surpass Twitter's client, which is fairly stupid but Photoshop is probably 1000 man years to duplicate in its full glory.  Subsets of Photoshop's functionality exist of course, but if you dive down to the bottom of the vast menu and palette tree they offer, it is a monstrously complex product at this point. I would say they are reaching the omega point of complexity where each thing they add makes the product worse in usability.

&gt; teams focusing on the graphical interface before they defined their backend algebra.<br/>I feel attacked haha :joy:  /jk but to take an example from the computer graphics industry, we've come to build really solid node-based interfaces for all sorts of applications (shader creation, AI, game scripting, etc...) and this explosion of solutions is in most cases thanks to technical artists; a small subset of people in the industry that often come from an art background but end up diving into code because their problems never get solved/understood by programmers.<br/><br/>This however often results in softwares/plugins that are extremely easy and pleasing to read for the artist, but quite limited due to the lack of technical skills of most technical artists that try to solve these issues.<br/><br/>The CEO of the company I work for (Quixel, who just got acquired by Epic Games) started as a texture artist, got frustrated by all the manual work and the lack of efforts from engineers to solve common problems that artists have been facing for nearly a decade, and started coding in Photoshop with Actions (a macro system that helps you wrap a chain of commands into one clickable button), then Actionscript, etc... and a few years later the company grew to over 150+ people all around the world.<br/><br/>This has perplexed me for a long time, and often makes me wonder how different programming could be if there were more artists/designers involved in the creation process, instead of it being "just" programmers.

Considering nodes and arrows languages, take MaxMSP for audio processing and compare to equivalent text/algebra code. The former is more expressive even if you can always map it to the later.

Unfortunately the node and wire models that are so successful in music don't map well to general computing. In the example of an analog synthesizer, you might start with a simple pure tone sine wave, and then add an effect that modulates its frequency, creating a warble, then you might add distortion that fades in and out, and by virtue of mixing all these effect stages eventually create something very interesting. But the output of all music productions is either two channel stereo or in the case of film music surround sound. But you only have to please the two ears of the listener. Text or graphics for example doesn't add together well; you superimpose two pieces of text, you can't read either of them any more. It is the simple fact that audio channels can just be added together and it never gets ruined; the texture just gets thicker and better. Wagner was the first multi-track artist, and in the history of music, you can see the Beach Boy's Pet Sounds album produced by Brian Wilson was a high water mark for US music production technique at the time, but soon surpassed by George Martin's production of Sgt. Pepper's. I believe that Wilson went into a major depression when he heard Sgt. Peppers because it was so good. Anyway it is quite common now to see 24 or more audio tracks combined. The peak of that phase wa Quincy Jone's Thriller, arguably the best made record in history. But the producers can just sit at the mixing board and fiddle until it sounds just right. We programmers don't have a raw material that can be added. If you put a nice big graph on the screen, you just pushed off the screen something else you wanted. We software people live in a world of tiny screens where we have to trade off what gets the most space. Shaders, image filter stacking, and audio are examples of subsets of the computational space that are fundamentally additive.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Dekorte</span> if you would like to see a great painting program for kids and have access to a windows program, you can get a free copy of my now ancient Flying Colors program. It was a big hit in its day (1995), and still runs even in Windows 10. It used a time travel feature for training, where it could narrate how to use the product while moving the mouse like a ghost. It was designed to be a sequel to KidPix  and had art from the incomparable pixel artist Mark Ferrari who did Loom, Monkey Island, and most recently Thimbleweek Park.   <a href="https://www.magicmouse.com/downloads/Flying%20Colors%20211D.zip">https://www.magicmouse.com/downloads/Flying%20Colors%20211D.zip</a><br/><br/>But to reinforce my point, the reason pixel-pushing programs work so well via direct manipulation interfaces, is that pixels in a bitmap add together easily. If you aren't blending, new pixels simply replace the old ones. You can't break the image by adding new pixels. At all times it functions as an image, while in general software, you add some new code and can easily break the whole product.

&gt; Unfortunately the node and wire models that are so successful in music don't map well to general computing.<br/>I am not sure there is such a thing as "general computing", at least in the sense of looking for A General Language that can be used for everything. As an exemple, the project I am working on currently for my company, is to use a scientific algorithms to produce snow and ice maps over Europe from satellite images. For this "simple" project, I use code for multiple things in different programming languages. Code for infrastructure in a Yaml based language specific to the cloud plateform I use (OpenStack), underlying scientific alglorithms in C++ with Python glue, Python for microservices, HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Vue for dashboard, SQL for DB, Dockerfile for containers, another Yaml based language for container orchestration and batch job management (HashiCorp Nomad). I can't see how a general language can handle all this programming use cases in an expressive way. But I can see the limitations of some of these text languages and I can imagine more expressive representation than text for some of them (for example the Yaml based language for infrastructure).

This is the tower of babel that the next gen general purpose language is attempting to replace. How many people actually know top to bottom a stack containing C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JS, Vue, SQL, Yaml, and Nomad? That is an awful lot of stuff to learn IMHO. In my Beads system I can replace the HTML/CSS/JS/Vue stack and Python and the database, so am making progress.  But interfacing with C++ is a no-go, as i am emitting either JS or AS3. Perhaps a Haxe target for desktop would allow C++ interfacing. There is a ton of code already written for mapping, and it is very technical and difficult to debug stuff. This is why so much inertia exists.

Python has no great event associated with its ascendancy. It is purely by good ergonomic design that it has crept up slowly and steadily. Better languages will replace JS, Java and Python, because those languages are inherently poor as they leave the user spending over 80% of their time debugging. All 3 are low productivity languages, and when something comes along that fixes the largest remaining problem in programming - which is debugging - they will finally start to wither. You can see the pressure building on JS, as TypeScript and so many others keep increasing share. JS, as a mandated language, has not had to compete on merit, but the eventual opening up to other languages via the evolution of WASM  will cause it to be dethroned. That being said, programming languages move like glaciers, very slowly. It took Python 25 years to get to where it is now.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@magicmouse94937</span> I think Python rode the wave of the web (and recently the data science and ml boom). To displace one of those 3 languages you mention, I think you'd have to find a big wave to ride and/or have something really simple yet radical. I like what you said here: "I feel the battle is one to supplant both Excel and the top 3 languages, in one tool that finally bridges these two almost uncommunicating realms.". I think of Excel as a 2D language, and have been trying to bridge the world of the 1-D =&gt; AST languages with grid languages like Excel. I also think someone could make some wholly novel type of 3-D language in AR or VR that could be a hit

To my knowledge Java is still a very commonly used server-side language. Python became embedded into Linux a long time ago in multiple subsystems; various build systems like yum which is the essential tool used in Centos/RedHat, and so on. In fact Centos 6.5 and earlier requires Python 2.6 else you can't run the OS, and for some reason if you install python 3 which has breaking changes to 2.6, Centos malfunctions. Most linux distributions are collections of hundreds of different utilities, and each of those has a dependency chain. The poor design of the Unix shared library (DLL's to those familiar with Windows) has been its achilles heel for a long time. This is why linux doesn't make much forward progress; most of the builds are just reshufflings of the existing tools rather than forward motion, held back by the inability to gracefully move forward. The whole Docker ecosystem can be considered to exist solely to fix the shared library conflict issue, by creating a custom environment for each program to exist in. A terrible band-aid over a festering sore IMHO.
