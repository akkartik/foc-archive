A piece of transformative UX design and engineering work that was done—without any chance of knowing how massive it would become.\n\nI think hyperlinks are bigger than the Internet. The Internet isn't the Internet without hyperlinks. Yes, hyperlinks don't work without a running internet, but the Internet isn't \"the thing\", it's \"the thing that let us create the (many exciting) things\".\n\nIt's wild to think that once the idea of hyperlinks formed, the UX design that arose was the application of text color and an underline. With that, semantic color and an underline, we got:\n\nHyperlinks as sharing.\n\nHyperlinks as social currency.\n\nHyperlinks as digital neural connections.\n\nHyperlinks as the connective tissue of civilization.\n\nHyperlinks as the most transformative tool in use by humans today?\n\nOr maybe, just maybe, cats had this planned out all along :grin:",

A piece of transformative UX design and engineering work that was done—without any chance of knowing how massive it would become.\n\nI think hyperlinks are bigger than the Internet. The Internet isn't the Internet without hyperlinks. Yes, hyperlinks don't work without a running internet, but the Internet isn't \"the thing\", it's \"the thing that let us create the (many exciting) things\".\n\nIt's wild to think that once the idea of hyperlinks formed, the UX design that arose was the application of text color and an underline. With that, semantic color and an underline, we got:\n\nHyperlinks as sharing.\n\nHyperlinks as social currency.\n\nHyperlinks as digital neural connections.\n\nHyperlinks as the connective tissue of civilization.\n\nHyperlinks as the most transformative tool in use by humans today?\n\nOr maybe, just maybe, cats had this planned out all along "

It would also require some ability to filter search results by author or publisher so you can see updates from just the original author, or links just from sources you're interested in.\n\nI'm not sure if that's the right answer or even close, but I think Nelson did a good job of articulating the capabilities we should be trying to provide.",
