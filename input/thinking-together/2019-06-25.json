        "text": "<@UK69SS8LB> GPUs support data-parallel computing. This is a powerful paradigm for general purpose computing. If you have thousands, or tens of thousands of processing units for each gigabyte of memory, that might be a more scalable and efficient architecture, a better way to allocate your transistor budget. HP's \"The Machine\" project proposed to \"bring processing closer to the data\", and that's what GPUs do when you have thousands of cores and gigabytes of memory on the same chip. (Although the HP material doesn't talk about GPUs explicitly.) There have been many research projects that investigated scalable, massively parallel computing, with huge numbers of cores, each having local memory. The advantage of GPUs is that every personal computer has one (I'm including cell phones in my definition of personal computer).\n\nCurrently, GPUs are difficult to program, the standard APIs are quite terrible. High level language support for data-parallel computing is quite limited. Conventional programming languages and libraries push you to use idioms that don't map well to data-parallel computing. So there are all these barriers that inhibit more widespread use of GPU capabilities, and I see a lot of wasted potential. Because of these barriers, GPUs are only used for a few specialized applications, like graphics and machine learning. If these barriers could be removed, via better languages and libraries, then GPUs and data-parallel programming might come to be used in a more general and pervasive way.

If you have thousands, or tens of thousands of processing units for each gigabyte of memory, that might be a more scalable and efficient architecture, a better way to allocate your transistor budget. HP's \"The Machine\" project proposed to \"bring processing closer to the data\", and that's what GPUs do when you have thousands of cores and gigabytes of memory on the same chip. (Although the HP material doesn't talk about GPUs explicitly.) There have been many research projects that investigated scalable, massively parallel computing, with huge numbers of cores, each having local memory. The advantage of GPUs is that every personal computer has one (I'm including cell phones in my definition of personal computer).\n\nCurrently, GPUs are difficult to program, the standard APIs are quite terrible.

                "text": "Chandler was a personal information management software suite described by its developers as a \"Note-to-Self Organizer\" designed for personal and small-group task management and calendaring. It is free software, previously released under the GNU General Public License, and  now released under the Apache License 2.0. It is inspired by a PIM from the 1980s called Lotus Agenda, notable because of its \"free-form\" approach to information management. Lead developer of Agenda, Mitch Kapor, was also involved in the vision and management of Chandler.\nChandler consisted of a cross-platform desktop application (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux), the Chandler Hub Sharing Service, Chandler Server, Chandler Quick Entry for iPhone, and Chandler Quick Entry for Android. Version 1.0 of the software was released on August 8, 2008.Chandler was developed by the Open Source Applications Foundation (OSAF). It is named after the mystery novelist Raymond Chandler.Chandler is also the subject of the non-fiction book Dreaming in Code: Two Dozen Programmers, Three Years, 4732 Bugs, and One Quest for Transcendent Software by Scott Rosenberg.",

The language is live, and reflective (in that code can be self-modifying), and allows for evaluation both forward and backward in time. Determinism is very important.\n\nIn this Twitter thread, I outline a problem — <https:\/\/twitter.com\/spiralganglion\/status\/1143704642997506049> — How can I compare the lengths of lines, deterministically, without resorting to discrete values? If I use some sort of alternative representation (eg: a function that, when evaluated, produces a value for comparison), how do I do it without running smack into the halting problem?\n\nI'd love it if folks could weigh-in on this.",
