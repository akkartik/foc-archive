My wife and I cannot get to our aging parents in India without aircraft. But I've never taken a flight from New York to Boston, likely never will...\n\nSo, I will:\n1. Take a car until I get well past Stockton or Modesto\n2. Park in Mariposa &amp; take a bicycle into Yosemite\n3. Stash the bike and gear up for the climb the old fashioned way\nAll the while making decisions to maximise purpose (fun, health, excitement, challenge, efficiency, and convenience, each in their right moment).\n_NB: #1 can be furthered improved by voting for representatives who will prioritise public transportation, and last mile connectivity. I'd rather not drive, where both my hands are tied the whole time_\n\nI think the system level errors are made when we lose finer grain resolution in purpose during collective decision making, perhaps...",
