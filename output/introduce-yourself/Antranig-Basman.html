Hi - I am Antranig Basman. I'm part of an overlapping group of publicly funded projects to improve people's access to technology. These are funded under the general headline of "accessibility" and improving the lives of people with disabilities, but we quickly realised that this mission will be uneconomic and unpractical unless we reform the way technology is built, and most importantly eliminate the use of all currently popular programming languages.<br/><br/>What we seek is to "democratise the affordances of computation" so that they can be accessed with as few barriers as possible imposed by interaction modality, style of cognition, representation, etc. We say "the affordances of computation" rather than "computation" since we believe what the public needs is not well described by computation as classically conceived.<br/><br/>If you're interested in a semi-technical exposition of what this means in terms of a conception of "Open Authorship", you can read my Onward 2018 preprint at <a href="https://github.com/amb26/papers/blob/master/onward-2016/onward-2016.pdf">https://github.com/amb26/papers/blob/master/onward-2016/onward-2016.pdf</a> - I live in London, looking forward to chatting with you all about many topics of interest! I'm particularly interested these days in reading about the philosophy and history of the numerous scientific and mathematical concepts that we tend to take for granted, and am a great fan of Lakatos, Lakoff, and Lakos.
