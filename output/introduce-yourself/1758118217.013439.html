Hello everyone,<br/><br/>My name is Hemi Edwards. I'm a computing and technology enthusiast from Aotearoa/New Zealand. I am indigenous and belong to the Rongowhakaata tribe of the Maori. We occupy our ancestral lands on the East Coast of Aotearoa/New Zealand, though we have lost much in the process of colonization. We have too gained much from our engagement with the rest of the world. For most of us our primary language is English but there have been efforts to revitalize our indigenous language of Te Reo Maori, for the last 50 years. Many other indigenous peoples see our success as an inspiration for the rejuvenation of their own traditional languages and I believe that digital technologies offer much to support this mission. Speaking English grants us opportunities to meaningfully engage with the wider work, especially in forums like this where we can learn about new possibilities and ways to think and interact with the physical world.<br/><br/>I have been familiar with Bret Victor's work for some years now and have been excited about the potential for these new approaches to make computer interactions more meaningful, embodied, and accessible than currently. This is really important especially when it comes to economically deprived and socially marginalized communities like my people, who lost much from colonization and whose experience in the traditional school system was specifically intended to stunt our development as individuals and as a people. This has had ongoing generational impacts for my people. Language revitalization is just one aspect of current efforts to close the gaps in terms of learning achievement, equitable economic participation, and development of personal and social capacity.

Welcome! Glad to have you with us. I would love to see more imagination in technology coming from sources of anti-colonialism. There's a genuinely important struggle happening that's been going on since the birth of computers–between the kind of mechanical/colonialist mindset and the organicist/indigenous mindset. John Von Neumann vs Norbert Wiener at the dawn of computing tells a lot of what was to come. Our technology doesn't have to reduce us to machines, but when you see the world mechanically, that's what happens.<br/><br/>Anyway, your efforts sound great, and I'd be happy to chat about whatever you're working on more.

Thanks so much for your welcome <span style="background-color:#ccf">@When Leggett</span> Probably a decade back when I read Bret Victor's work I also came across the thinking of Ron Eglash, who is an academic mathematician, and Professor of Information Technology, whose interests intersect with cybernetics, youth culture, mathematics, information technology, and computing architectures. He found some interesting parallels between the development of different computing architectures (analog, digital, and hybrid) and the evolution of distinct youth subcultures (hippie, New Age, hiphop).<br/><br/>My own culture is somewhat of a hybrid. We use both analog (continuous, flowing) spiral motifs called called the Koru common in tattoos and carvings and digital (discrete, binary), tukutuku and pakati patterns commonly used in weaving and carving. They intertwine the artistic and metaphysic dimensions of our culture.<br/><br/>"Starting around 1987, cybernetic models again shifted; this time to a synthesis of the competing opposites.  The term "stable postmodernism" is appropriate in that the move resolves both technical and social tensions of the previous sharp reversal in these information dimensions.<br/><br/>When we last left mathematics, it had moved from the Euclidian linearity of the 1960s to the fractals and dynamical chaos of the 1970s.  In the late 1980s these two approaches were brought together.  This was nicely illustrated by the "multifractal" approach initiated by Uriel Frisch (Nice Observatory) and Giorgio Parisi (University of Rome) in 1985.  Multifractals are shapes which cannot be characterized by a single fractal dimension. Since they have multiple dimension measures attributed to them, some of these can be whole numbers.  Thus multifractals can incorporate both fractal and Euclidian structures.  A similar fractal-Euclidian synthesis has developed in the use of Michael Barnsley's Iterated Function Systems (IFS).  Because combinations of both fractal and Euclidian shapes can be created (based on Barnsley's "collage theorem"), by the late 1980s a corporation had been formed for commercial application to image compression (transmitting algorithms for producing the picture instead of the picture itself)."<br/><a href="https://roneglash.org/eglash.dir/cyb/youth/youth.htm">https://roneglash.org/eglash.dir/cyb/youth/youth.htm</a>

In fact our cousins in the Maruesas developed a form of counting that combined binary with a traditional decimal system.<br/><br/>Just like English has a few special words like a dozen for 12 and a score for 20, the Mangarevan language has special words for large groups. But their special counting words are all decimal numbers multiplied by powers of two, which are 1, 2, 4, 8 … . Specifically, <em>takau</em> equals 10; <em>paua</em> equals 20; <em>tataua</em>, 40; and <em>varu</em>, 80. Those big numbers are useful for keeping track of collections of valuable items, such as coconuts, that come in large numbers. Bender and Beller realized that <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1309160110">the Mangarevan counting system makes it possible to use bina&hellip;</a>, they report today in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> in a paper that even nonexperts will enjoy reading.<br/><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/polynesians-may-have-invented-binary-math">https://www.science.org/content/article/polynesians-may-have&hellip;</a>

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Alex Bender</span> That's a cool initiative. I actually had seen an interview with Julian Oliver on one of our public media outlets, not so long ago. I have been personally exploring the local first and peer to peer software paradigms, because of many of the issues that Julian identifies, but with the traditional client/server paradigm there still remains the issue of system persistence, if the admin team breaks down, then the system goes down too. That's a major problem in the gaming scene at the moment. Local first software and peer to peer frameworks like libp2p mitigates that risk significantly. Naturally there are still lots of useful tools that are developed under the traditional client/server architecture paradigm, so it will take some time to develop local-first p2p tools to replace them.<br/><br/>I'm actually working on a workforce skills development provider for indigenous youth in my community to provide them with highly demanded skills that prepares them for a rapidly changing economy, that offers them cultural sovereignty and economic security not available elsewhere.<br/><br/>I'm currently talking with a math education researcher who developed a culturally relevant mathematics education pedagogy and have corresponded with Ron Eglash about developing something similar that teaches computing principles.<br/><a href="https://tinyurl.com/4kxr36v9">https://tinyurl.com/4kxr36v9</a><br/><a href="https://csdt.org/">https://csdt.org/</a><br/><br/>The Bobbie Maths teaching method is physically embodied and conducted in groups so I thought that perhaps some of the tech that Bret Victor developed for Dynamicland would be really valuable for supporting it.
