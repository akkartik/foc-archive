Yes, it seems to me that JITs are where lots of partial evaluation work is done.  Partial evaluation is so delightful, I'm often surprised people don't talk about it more.  In contrast to how dynamic languages provide flexibility to the point of incoherence, serious staging can give you better defined intermediate steps to target and some certainty about what comes out at the end.
