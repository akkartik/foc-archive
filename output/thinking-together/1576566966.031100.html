One thing that really gave JetBrains a big leg up is that Google used their tools, and as the dominant software company on the planet, that means a lot. Having a sponsoring rich customer, which in the old days we called it a "sugar daddy", was very advantageous for many firms. JetBrains is indeed a huge success, with over 700 employees last time I checked. Only a few tool companies like Adobe are bigger.
