Oops just saw in the <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/member-handbook#introduce-yourself">member handbook</a> and #administrivia I should’ve first posted here. So:<br/>&gt; tell us about your background<br/>Originally I got into coding through film. I was preparing for auditions for my first feature. Upon posting a casting notice online I got over 4000 submissions. I had hardly any $$ so I couldn’t hire casting agents or assistants. At that time I started to dabble in coding, mostly making small games like battleship. I realized I could use google sheets + gscript (JS-like scripting around gsuite products) to send emails. I exported all actors data into a CSV, imported it into sheets, rated actors based on their video reels and fit for the role.<br/>Then wrote a 80 line script that sent them personalized emails in which, if their rating was high, they’d be invited to a scheduled audition and when low to an open call. The emails were signed by a made up person “Janina Kebera - Production Office Assistant.” I hacked on the script for 3 days, then pressed a button and it sent 4000+ emails in less than a second.<br/>I got 20 responses in 2 minutes, 40 in 5. I ended up doing the auditions but never the movie. My experience with it was so impactful, I decided to pursue coding instead.<br/>Since then I made <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-learnable-world-20ee8da4690a">Vimsical</a>, <a href="https://github.com/den1k/root">root</a>, genetic algorithms for CSS, trading algorithms, <a href="https://theshopgrid.com/">GRID</a> and a <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/dennis/page/oq8QVA0Sq">few other projects</a>.<br/><br/>&gt; what your interests are<br/>While learning about genetic algorithms I stumbled upon the concept of fitness functions and made my own. It’s <em>“have fun and be curious.”</em> This gets me around.<br/><br/>&gt; how you got into computer futurism<br/>I don’t know if I have. I think we got ahead of ourselves. The future lies in the past.<br/><br/>how you found the Slack<br/>&gt; I got introduced to Steve Krouse in the early days of FoC<br/>interesting hobbies<br/>&gt; only code makes it online :wink: so here’s my <a href="https://github.com/den1k">github</a><br/>Really love skimming through the posts here. People are up to amazing stuff! Feedback is constructive, people help providing context through links etc. Thanks everyone and especially <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> for all your hard work on FoC.
