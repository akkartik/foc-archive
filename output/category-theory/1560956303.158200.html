Here in video 1.2, here <a href="https://youtu.be/p54Hd7AmVFU?t=2520">https://youtu.be/p54Hd7AmVFU?t=2520</a>, he says "You can map a set to itself in many ways, you can interchange element" and he does a shuffle with his hands.<br/><br/>First a basic question<br/>1. Were talking about sets in terms of set theory, not sets as they appear in programming languages correct? i'm not aware of any places where they differ, but set theory might contain some additional axioms (is that the right word?).<br/><br/>Now back to a more direct question about when he says "you can interchange an element"<br/>2. As i understand it, set's deal with just membership, interchange implies changing order, so trying to change the order in a set would do nothing right? but is that the same as identity? I had identity as simply the idea that a -&gt; a. This would seem to imply that a-&gt;b-&gt;a contains the identity function for a of -&gt;b-&gt;a
