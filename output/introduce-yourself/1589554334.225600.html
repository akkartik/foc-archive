Hello! My name is Haakon and I'm a pretty fresh software engineer (around 1 year of experience and 1 year as a "data person" in a start-up) focusing on discrete optimization: routing and network planning in particular. Before that I dabbled around in mathematics for some years.<br/><br/>It is only this last year that I have worked with a real, running software system that has grown organically over many years, with all the kinks and constraints from previous design choices that entails.  I often find myself thinking (and occasionally screaming in frustration) "there must be a better way to do this" so I am hoping to find some inspiration here and to hopefully contribute as well!
