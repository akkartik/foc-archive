Congrats on starting the project, especially in Haskell (I am biased) :smile:!<br/>Similar to what <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mariano Guerra</span> asked, who is the audience? On one hand they need to know Haskell, but on the other hand they want to build an app from their mobile phone? That doesn't sound like a same person. I am in general confused about building an app from phone - I can hardly imagine somebody wanting to do that compared to doing from their PC, unless it is drag and drop maybe, but this doesn't sound like it? Or maybe I am getting the whole thing wrong?<br/>It would be really interesting if you could describe the problem in more details -&gt; in which situation might somebody want to use Compose. Or what would usage look like, through a story.

Great questions <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Martin Sosic</span>! I'm not quite ready to show mockups. (they're too ugly!) But the idea is that we're really leveraging Haskell's composability, particularly the point-free, arrowized style, to make lots of tiny programs that you can recompose into bigger ones. I want it to feel a bit like writing an essay as a twitter thread

My thesis is that the reason people don't program on the phone is that they can't, not that they don't want to or wouldn't if it was good. This thesis seems to have held up for almost any computer activity so far

I’d be very excited to see someone finally crack the phone thing - we tried experiments for years and never found something satisfactory. Composition is certainly a very important part of the equation though :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>From a business perspective, I’d wager there are maybe 10's of thousands to 100's of thousands of serious haskell programmers. Of those, I’d expect the intersection of “interested in programming on a phone” to be 100s, maybe 1000s. Prices for phone apps are quite low, I suspect you <em>might</em> be able to charge $20-50 with a very narrow audience. Even if we assume it is 1000s and $50, I’m not sure how you’d sustain a business with multiple employees. I’ve seen lots of folks come up with something great and then not have a real path to sustainability, so I’d really think hard about that if building a business is an important part of the endeavor.

Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Granger</span>! Yeah the business only works if we can drastically increase the number of Haskell programmers (in the way Rails did for Ruby). That's why it's so risky: 1) can we get 100 Haskell programmers to love it? and then 2) can we get 100k non-Haskell programmers to learn Haskell on the platform? I'm optimistic on both counts but regardless stacked risks multiply and that's no bueno.<br/><br/>As far as why I'm optimistic on people learning Haskell... I had my head exploded when I went to a Tidal Cycles meetup at <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jack</span>'s suggestion: it was a room full of people using do-notation (and other complex FP ideas) to make music that had never heard the term "monad"!

in that case I wouldn't focus on "hey use this, it's haskell!" and more on "hey, use this, it gives you the superpowers that until now where only available in advanced programming languages, and it's really easy/fun to use!"

I don't want to generalize, but the reason why many programmers are against visual programming and other new technologies like visual basic and scripting languages is that it undermines their status, so it may happen that haskell programmers reject it because now it makes their secret weapon more accessible

rails succeeded because it had the killer app of building websites very quickly when the business world was rapidly coming online. There really isn’t a good trend to attach to right now for “on the phone.” The best I can imagine is like what they’re pitching - quickly build phone apps on device.

Yeah, I'd say it's not (or shouldn't be) about "Haskell", but a very easy and direct way to build pieces of programs. The fact that you discovered some of the properties which enable that, to be baked into Haskell, is incidental.

I've always wanted to get into Haskell more, so I'm squarely in the target audience (rarely has a pitch felt so focused just on me). The risk this has me worrying about is the error experience. How you give good error messages tailored to a small screen without having to fork a Haskell compiler. Or do y'all plan to fork?

The fact that anyone is asking "who'd want to use a phone?" is rather telling of a problem with programming &amp; technology (which Steve is working to solve, here).<br/><br/>Imagine a slightly different status quo: Who'd want to use a computer? If you really want to be productive, you're going to need a whole laboratory and your own factory, and your own biodome and space suit.<br/><br/>My goodness! How badly has programming and technology evolved, that you can't use simple tools to compose logical components in a simple and straightforward way?<br/><br/>It used to be unthinkable to browse the web or do MANY things, that are now mostly done from "phones" now.

Still, there does seem to be a big difference between browsing and creating. Writing programs often involves doing multiple things at the same time: research (browser), coding (IDE), running/looking at logs(terminal). It is intensive activity, because problems we are solving are hard, so having proper equipment (multiple displays, keyboard, mouse) does make a difference. That said, maybe I am just old fashioned and future is on the phone who knows! Although, if future woudl be really be on the phone, I would expect some novel kind of interface (like projected screen or keyboard and similar) that enhance both output and input capacity, but then it comes back to being a computer. Don't mind me too much, just thinking out loud. For the context I am Haskell developer.

Fair points! I'm sure heavy duty intensive development will stay as you say; but the scope of all software development by anyone (e.g. as a new kind of literacy and/or thinking tool), can expand far beyond that. You certainly wouldn't write a thesis on your phone, but look at all this discussion we are having from my phone! It might have been hard to predict decades ago that people would "casually" "type up" thing after thing with just their thumbs, but the context for that didn't used to exist (and we have tools and context for this that would have been hard to predict). But certainly, that hasn't become the "new" way of sitting down and writing a serious paper. I think the same could apply for creating the "stuff" of software. That might not be called "programming" though, just like this here is not "writing a document" in the sense that that used to (and even still) connotates.

To echo what others have said here, I assume your Compose page here Steve is targeted at Haskellers who, on clicking through on Reflex, say, "being able to make use of something like that without setup and ceremony sounds great.  Sign me up!"<br/><br/>Comparing to Rails, this announcement comes well before the first public presentation and fifteen minute demo.  Let me add that at Ruby Conf 2004, maybe 3/50 were using Ruby professionally, and the first question to DHH after his presentation was "What editor is that?"  Second question was "Can we get a copy?"<br/><br/>If you want a Compose demo to attract Haskell people, Explorable Explanations of some classic Haskell papers?  FRP, STM, and Parsec come to mind.

Business side sounds somewhat tough, but there is always time to explore that further if usage is there.

&gt; Ever had an idea for an app for your friends or community? Now's your chance to make it real.<br/>Speaking for myself, it's never been particularly hard to hack together an app for a few friends. It doesn't even particularly matter what framework I use. I used to try not to be dogmatic. But the hard part I kept running into was <em>keeping</em> apps running over time. The maintenance/upgrade burden is just too onerous. And that too seems a universal constant no matter what language or framework you use.
