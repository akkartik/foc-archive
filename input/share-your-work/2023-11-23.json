        "text": "Hi <@UE6EFEPTQ>,\n\nLove your ideas and the exchange here.\n\nSomething I'm working on feels like a nice fit to your ideas. I'll just describe it here and see what you or others have to say.\nI'm working on a new programming language. One with few and simple rules. One with little to no syntactical sugar (we all know by now that sugar is bad for us). It is based on the notion of Things (you could call them objects) having Behaviour. Things can have Pockets (you could call them slots) to store stuff in. What is interesting is that Things can receive or drop Behaviour dynamically (you could say it has NO class hierarchy). Using this dynamic Behaviour allows for having (adding) Behaviour in specific contexts. If you put a Thing in a calendar it might receive an 'OnDate' or 'AtMoment' Behaviour. This Behaviour could have a Pocket in which a category (or other text) is stored describing what that date or timestamp means to the Thing. Like it could be a deadline or a birthdate. (If the Thing already had 'OnDate' Behaviour, none would be added or the calendar would ask if it should use that behaviour or add a new one.) A Thing might be visible in the calendar on multiple dates. All with their own relevant information. And when you want a notification prior to some date or timestamp, you could add a 'Notifier' Behaviour to that Thing. This Behaviour would require some 'OnDate' or 'AtMoment' Behaviour is present (which the Notifier could check for or add). It would have a Pocket holding the duration before the date or timestamp before it would start the actual notification. And so forth.\n\nEvery Thing can have a default Behaviour for displaying and interacting. A sort of generated User Interface (created using reflection mechanism). But specific displaying and interaction Behaviour can be added as well. Typically UIs could be described using some dimension as guideline. Allowing different UIs based on the dimensions (but also device) available. This does not only allow for mobile vs desktop UIs, but could also allow embedding Things in the UI of other Things. Like a Thing in a (typical matrix-like) week-view within a calendar could display only a few items like a title or so. When the same Thing is displayed in a day-view, it could show much more information. Or when it is shown on its own it could provide a full interface with access to all information.\n\nTypically the idea of interacting in the User Interface (for the desktop) is by simply clicking on Things, dragging\/dropping Things (to make Things connect) and by having buttons represent actions on the Things. All editing (on text fields for example) is direct. No need to first go to an 'edit' mode. Changes are saved automagically. Undo is (should be) a primary feature. More elaborate UIs can be created, but chances are they will also limit the ability to interact with the rest of the environment and create an app (kind of thing) within a app-free environment.\n\nHope this longish description makes sense.\n\nThe language itself will look very much like Smalltalk (syntax wise). It also is based on the idea of message sends (Alan Kay's explanation). Like Actors, Things can implement their own way of handling messages they receive. The default being to find a method with the same 'selector' as the message being sent and then executing it. But queueing could be added as a Behaviour. Onto which prioritisation could be added as a Behaviour, etc.\n\nThe laguage will be (again like Smalltalk) very late bound and without explicit type checking. If a message is not understood, a Thing will say so. And allowing Behaviour to override this (again like Smalltalk).\n\nThe language would ideally be run in a live environment (again like Smalltalk). This would allow debugging and adding Behaviour (even more) dynamically. Within the OnexOS I could see this as a means of allowing you to manipulate every Thing directly. No need for doing a compile and deploy run. Of course with great power comes great responsibility. You could kill your OS in seconds. There are ways to prevent doing this accidentally, like you could have a 'door' or something you have to open first, before reaching the delicate or 'dangerous' stuff. The door gives a clear description of the risks you are taking. But please, let's not dumb people down or scare them away from trying things out. A good 'undo' feature is maybe the required solution for this. Once people learn to try things out and not be afraid to ruin things, creativity can flourish (like crazy ;-).\n\nBesides the evident Smalltalk, ideas and inspiration have come from Actors, DCI (Data Context Interaction), Expressive Systems and Worlds (to name just a few). Below are some links. I also added a link to a demo I gave (together with my business partner) which represents some of the ideas for a UI (at that time still in pilot stage). Aside: I definitely need to work on my presentation skills...ouch...\n\nSo much more to say, but leaving it at this for now.\n\n[Expressive Systems] - <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xBGoOipssN0>\n[DCI] - <https:\/\/dci.github.io>\n[Worlds] - <https:\/\/tinlizzie.org\/VPRIPapers\/tr2011001_final_worlds.pdf>\n[Pilot implementation UI] - <https:\/\/vimeo.com\/719355883#t=515s>",

                "text": "For our May meeting, Object Guild's Jonathan van Alteren and Erik Stel will give us a preview of Expressive Systems.\n\nExpressive Systems is a framework inspired by Richard Pawson's work on Naked Objects (  ). It allows Object Guild (  ) to rapidly develop flexible applications by focusing on the design of behaviorally complete objects in the business domain. By using a novel web application architecture based on CodeParadise (  ), it allows direct manipulation of business objects by the user. The goal of the framework is to better support problem solving activities and to empower users by giving them a first-person experience. The framework is currently in a (private) alpha phase of development. There are plans to open source the framework in the future.\n\nJonathan has been developing business applications for various Dutch companies since 2001, in roles varying from programmer to solution architect. In 2018, he got hooked on Pharo\/Smalltalk and never looked back.\n\nErik has developed both technical as well as business applications in a variety of areas using a broad range of technologies. He’s been a Smalltalk addict since using VisualAge in the late 1990’s.\n\n\nRecorded 25 May 2022.\n\n\nThe UK Smalltalk User Group is a group or professionals and hobbists who share an interest in the Smalltalk programming languages and related technologies.
