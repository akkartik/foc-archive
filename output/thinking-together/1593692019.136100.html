I’d like to break this out from a thread above and talk about remixing, business models, and open standards: <a href="1593659834.110700.html#1593684929.127500">1.593684.html&hellip;</a><br/><br/>In today’s business-driven technology environment it seems success is tied to ownership of a platform or “walled garden”. The idea of sharing and making things work with each other is severely limited.<br/><br/>It hasn’t always been that way. All these walled gardens run on core technologies that are open standards (Internet protocols, web standards, etc.) and wouldn’t exist without them.<br/><br/>How did we end up here? And more importantly, how can we swing back to a more remix-friendly environment? What creates incentives for that?

you can see it in this group, when someone says that they would like to do it full time the most common strategy is to save money and use it to sustain development for a period of time or to interleave it with consulting.

the way I did it is to "grow out of consulting" by building tools to work faster and bill the consulting part until the tools were good enough to be sold by themselves, then partner for the "consulting on the ground" part (installation, setup, migrations, upgrade) and keep focusing on product development.

but still it's easier to sell your product in a package with the consulting stuff than via a license of any sort, licensing goes through a different channel inside companies, it's pretty easy to charge X for consulting hours and really hard to charge the same X for a license, so sometimes the price is "product + consulting hours" and they just pay for the hours (training, setup, workshops, support)

Crafting a business model around something that's not just open source but actively remix friendly is one of the big open questions that (I assume) is why it's currently rare to see such tools come to light.

A model like the following seems to me like a possible path for some tools:<br/><br/>- free, local-first tools that deliver most of the value on your personal hardware<br/>- sharing / team / premium features which require a server component available as a default hosted version with pricing that supports development of all components<br/>- all components (local and server) are open source and can be self-hosted<br/><br/>This does run the risk of becoming "complexity capture" like <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mariano Guerra</span> mentioned, but I think it could be pulled off in an elegant way with the right team culture and values, where you really do value and consider the self-hosted case, rather just throwing it up as effectively PR for how "open" you "are".<br/><br/>That seems like decent approach, but of course it's somewhat complex, doesn't apply to every possible product, etc. In general, I'd like to see a lot more innovative ways to fund malleable / remixable software.

There's also various alternate licenses that may work for this case, like the BSL, no-SaaS, etc. ones <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mariano Guerra</span> mentioned. Kyle E. Mitchell has several interesting "alternative" licensing schemes (<a href="https://projects.kemitchell.com/">https://projects.kemitchell.com/</a>) that could work well, like the PolyForm licenses (<a href="https://polyformproject.org/licenses/">https://polyformproject.org/licenses/</a>) that e.g. allow you to do anything as long as you don't compete.

&gt; I think it could be pulled off in an elegant way with the right team culture and values, where you really do value and consider the self-hosted case, rather just throwing it up as effectively PR for how "open" you "are".<br/>Yeah, the crucial challenge here for me is that most customers don't truly internalize the value of openness beyond superficial aspects. As a result, an organization trying to truly do the right/sustainable thing is often at a disadvantage relative to one that's just performing 'open!'. For this reason I think the society we live in isn't mature enough for sustainable open commercial businesses in most industry segments. To get there we need a more appreciative, thoughtful audience/consumer base. Which isn't the sort of thing one can just magic into existence.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Maughan</span> just reminded me of an older post of mine that might be relevant: <a href="../linking-together/1587746535.114000.html">../linking-together/1587746535.114000.html</a>

Hi everyone, really happy to hear you all discussing this. This is actually an existential question right now for me. I’m working on <a href="https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/">Athens</a>, which is effectively “open-source Roam” at the moment (but hopefully can become something much more in the future). I’m currently thinking about what open-source licenses make sense for Athens, what biz models are possible if the software is free, and how we could compete against Roam long-term when they’ve already raised from VCs. Would love your help here haha…

I mainly agree with what everyone has said already<br/><br/>| most customers don’t truly internalize the value of openness beyond superficial aspects<br/>(<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span>) User’s don’t care about open-source the same way they don’t care if your app uses blockchain and AI. Perhaps slightly different depending on how much sensitive data you put into the app (<a href="http://e.ga">e.g. </a>a note taking app). This is more relevant to the people here because FoC peeps seem to be especially interested in <em>end-user</em> software, whereas the successful open-source companies so far have been building developer infrastructure. Here, open-source is more of a requirement from the developers. “Successful” open-source end-user apps: LibreOffice, VLC Media Player… GIMP<br/><br/>I really haven’t looked at these other open-source licenses, but I think Apache is generally the most business friendly. Not saying there’s anything wrong with other licenses, but there’s an extreme power law distribution of them

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> There's a fundamental tension between remixability and interop. Proprietary implementations of open standards have a huge incentive to parley user bases of their implementations into incompatible forks for locking in their customers. So I consider standards to be a waste of time. Either everyone's on the same implementation and the standard is irrelevant (CPython), or it's slowly becoming irrelevant (Common Lisp).

Is it possible we're just done with standards because it's too easy to switch?<br/><br/>We needed a standard for phones because everyone needed to be able to call everyone else. Now I can talk to people for free on 1000 different apps, emphasis on free. Someone tells me contact me on "Kik" (never heard of it) and I install "Kik" and start talking to them. As a geek I hate installing stuff and signing up for new services to be tracked but I'm going to guess most people don't think twice about it.<br/><br/>Standards can also stifle innovation because instead of just adding the feature you want you have to argue about it for years in standards committees. Sure maybe you can come up with some extension mechanism but then you're kind of back to the same thing, only people with your app can use your special extension.<br/><br/>OTOH I'm happy HTML exists and is a standard. It enables all kinds of things because it's in a standard format used in a standard environment. All the browser extensions like Rikaikun (japanese to english helper) and even Ublock Origin (the element zapper) and I'm guessing the password managers only work because everything is running in a standard environment with a standard data representation. If everything was native apps that ability disappears.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Garth Goldwater</span> RoR was "extracted" from the work 37 signals (now basecamp) did while developing basecamp, so it's similar to the model I mentioned about developing open source while doing your day job at a company. Or do you refer to something else?

“Big” standards like TCP/IP, HTTP, HTML, etc. seem to be the infrastructure that was built in the past that everything today still mostly depends on. We wouldn’t have been able to get to today without them. But there seems to be a pattern where the heavy lifting is done by visionaries motivated by ideals (and backed by governments and/or large corporations’ R&amp;D budget) and then capitalism swooping in, taking over, and making their foundational work look like it’s no longer necessary (and perhaps it is no longer necessary?).

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mariano Guerra</span> the weird part about it is that 1. a ton of their money comes from the original product (basecamp) rather than rails itself 2. both the product and the open source stuff did really well and 3. they built the product and the open source platform at pretty much the same time

Well I am not sure we have walled gardens. Npm, container repos and others let anyone make their own version of a repo library  if they wish don’t they? Or am I misunderstanding the thesis? Like Facebook did with npm and yarn

I interpreted the walled garden as FB Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat, iMessage, Line, Kik, etc do not work with each other. I can't be in WhatsApp and message someone using WeChat.<br/><br/>Same with Zoom, Facetime, Meet, Skype, etc... I can't video conference with someone from Zoom if they're running Facetime. They have to download Zoom.<br/><br/>I don't know if re-mixing and open standards are important here or not. Except for iMessage (haha) all the others work everywhere and are free so if someone says "contact me on X" I just install X. I think it's likely to get worse. If you believe in the acceleration of change then before you can standardize something it will become irrelevant? Like there was a SMS standard. Who still uses it (I'm sure India or some place like that still uses it). My point is a 140 character standard has mostly been supplanted. Next we need images in our messages. Then we need video clips, then live voice, then live video, tomorrow we'll require shared AR or shared VR or something.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the Web is pretty good at remixing. Iframes and other APIs let me mix stuff from all over.<br/><br/><a href="https://driveandlisten.herokuapp.com/">https://driveandlisten.herokuapp.com/</a><br/><br/>Yet another reason I'm glad for web tech and often anti-native apps :stuck_out_tongue:
