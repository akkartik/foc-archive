Hypothesis: the greatest affordance text delivers is supporting our natural desire to name things. We do this all the time when we communicate, and we know very well which words to use to transmit pretty complex concepts. In (text-based) programming, names (symbols) solve all the problems of referring to the same thing over and over again. With arrows we get to represent some of the references visually, at the expense of trying very hard to only have the thing they refer to represented once.<br/><br/>I know, there’s the joke about naming being one of the two or three (depending on how funny you try to be) hardest things in programming. Although we’re actually pretty good at giving things names. We’re just terrible at agreeing on the same name for the same thing.
