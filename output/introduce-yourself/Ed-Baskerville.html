Hi everybody! I’m yet another child of HyperCard hoping to recapture the dream of the ’90s. I’m currently working with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Peter Abrahamsen</span> on an end-user thing; we’re experimenting with building it using a simple Datalog-like model.<br/>Divergently, I’ve spent a lot of time in academia building ecological and evolutionary models, all the while dreaming about more natural ways for scientists to work with computers. (And doing basically nothing about it.)<br/>Less concretely, I’m generally hopeful for a future where many more people view computers as infinitely flexible instruments of creative expression rather than devices limited by what professional software developers are willing to provide.<br/>I’m also interested in how power structures in society have affected the way we use computers—and what we can do about it.<br/>I’m here for the conversations!
