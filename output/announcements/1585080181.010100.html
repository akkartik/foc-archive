Hey y’all! I’ve just left my last job and am looking for a Data Science or Product Manager position (either Boston or remote). I’d love to hear from anyone who has hybrid positions (like Dev Advocate / Customer Eng positions around data science).<br/><br/>• I’ve spent the last ~5 years at Dataquest, where I joined as the first employee (now 33) and helped the company grow from $0 to multi-million in ARR. I was exposed to / responsible for many different aspects of the business throughout my time there. <br/>• My formal background is in Math / CS. I started off writing data science courses at Dataquest, then held a few different management roles .. the last of which was Product Manager (<a href="http://linkedin.com/in/srinivasakadamati">linkedin.com/in/srinivasakadamati</a>). I still need to start my blog:thinking_face: <br/>• <b>My career mission is to help democratize data science.</b> <em>I’m quite open to any roles where I can help put data &amp; research to action</em>, whether it’s doing analysis &amp; visualization or translating complex technical &amp; data topics to others. I’m also open to part-time / freelance roles<br/>Thanks y’all!
