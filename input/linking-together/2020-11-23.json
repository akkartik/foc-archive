Differentiating programming languages, environments, and editors>\n```So what do we call things like Scratch? It's a programming language that comes with rich web-based programming environment that features a block-based editor. If we're talking about the language, we use the word language; if we're talking about the website, we use the word environment; and if we're talking about the website's editor, we can say block-based editor. If we're talking about all of them, we might call the entire collection a programming system, or just Scratch.```",
