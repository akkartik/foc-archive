Composition is certainly a very important part of the equation though :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nFrom a business perspective, I’d wager there are maybe 10's of thousands to 100's of thousands of serious haskell programmers. Of those, I’d expect the intersection of “interested in programming on a phone” to be 100s, maybe 1000s. Prices for phone apps are quite low, I suspect you _might_ be able to charge $20-50 with a very narrow audience. Even if we assume it is 1000s and $50, I’m not sure how you’d sustain a business with multiple employees. I’ve seen lots of folks come up with something great and then not have a real path to sustainability, so I’d really think hard about that if building a business is an important part of the endeavor.",
