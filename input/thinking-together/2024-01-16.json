To be fair, this time it genuinely *is* different. \n\nIt’s interesting what this article prioritizes. It talks a lot about having the context of the conversation. Which we kind of get for free now. What’s fascinating to me at the moment is how people are modifying things like ChatGPT with custom directives or domain specific GPTs. I don’t love that they’re building on a closed ecosystem (or is it _Open_AI?), but that’s another story. \n\nThese customizations are more in line with UX concerns like the ones illustrated in this pre-consumer LLM article on Chat Bots: <https:\/\/chatbotsmagazine.com\/the-future-healthcare-and-conversational-ui-87182d9045e0|https:\/\/chatbotsmagazine.com\/the-future-healthcare-and-conversational-ui-87182d9045e0>\n\nHere we have the healthcare sector and the author does mention context but spends most of her time talking about _empathy_ and what constitutes _simplicity_ in such an interface.
