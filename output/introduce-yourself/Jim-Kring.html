Hi :wave:  I’m Jim Kring. I co-authored LabVIEW for Everyone (back when people read books) and I’m working to self-host a visual programming language. I’ve been using LabVIEW for nearly 30 years, and a few years back I started exploring re-writing LabVIEW in LabVIEW. I’ve got a lot of interesting ideas in this space (many of them working) and am now starting to implement them in modern web technologies and with AI co-pilot capabilities. I’m also very interested in visual languages as a means for more efficiently interacting with AI (and parallel compute targets) as a means for having visibility into proposed actions by AI agents and enable human accountability for such systems to keep them safe. I’m looking forward to sharing ideas and successes. Kind Regards, Jim<br/><a href="https://create.vi">https://create.vi</a> <br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimkring">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimkring</a>
