Seems like the message from the Better Software Conference is that the future of programming should be: simple, low level ( aka fast ), imperative, data-oriented ( not oop ) coding. <br/>I kind of like itâ€¦ Started working in C again for some personal projects, and I enjoy it.

I have some sense of why people like to allocate memory and put things in places but I struggled with this approach even when I was young.<br/><br/>Learning Peek/Poke addresses on Atari BASIC seemed orthogonal to what I was trying to achieve. Of course I did it and twiddled some bits at various times. But it never seemed "simple."<br/><br/>Then in college I was introduced to Lisp and it really clicked. I share this because I always found it funny how different minds come to determine the meaning of simple.
