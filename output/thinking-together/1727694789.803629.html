Hey :wave:  I was recently searching again how "usable"  "AI" became. So I stumbled on this tool: <a href="https://pinokio.computer/">pinokio</a> . Its all just JSON. Before just evalutating the tool I might describe the criteria I would be interested in. Broadly speaking I would like to have tool similar to what we see in this clip: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGYFEI6uLy0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGYFEI6uLy0</a><br/>Consider The following more specific scenario:<br/>I have a PKM Zettelkasten and I have some friends. Now my workflow is to write and then to publish. I want to provide for them a Voice assistant that can summarize contents based on various parameters: By time e.g. topics of last 3 months, last week. But I also want to provide overviews on specific topics as well as interesting interconnections.<br/>Do you know of any tools that could help with creating such use cases?
