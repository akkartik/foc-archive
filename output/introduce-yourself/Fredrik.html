Hello, World<br/>I'm an independent researcher based in Sweden/Czechia/Germany. I've been spending the last six years researching how to make better text editors (both plain text and rich text), GUIs, GUI frameworks, portable assembly, web browsers and visual programming. I don't publish much, because this is a rabbit hole where making a <em>better something</em> depends on making a <em>better something else</em>, and most things are broken most of the time because of working an a dependency, which then depends on another dependency, but sometimes I go out and speak at events.<br/><br/>The latest addition to my suite of technologies is an unconventional programming language that unifies all my previous technologies. It's a general purpose language and multimedia authoring language unified, that can be used to describe apps, network services, documents, slideshows, websites, pictures and videos in an amount of code that is close to the theoretical minimum, and from that generates code that has an efficiency close to the theoretical maximum. It uses pointers for efficiency and propositional logic for correctness, including complete memory safety. This language proves that in traditional computing there is no tradeoff between efficiency, robustness and ease of use. The same programming language is going to be used for writing high-performance algorithms as for teaching children programming.<br/><br/>Doing research in the future of coding gets lonely. Even among people who work with programming, there are few who understand what I'm doing. I met someone at Jetbrains who showed a good understanding of what I'm doing. He took a look at my visual code editor and recommended me Future of Coding. I've been delaying posting anything here for a year, as I've been feeling overwhelmed with things to do even before starting to involve other people, but now I feel the time is right. I'm writing here in hope to connect with interesting people. Feel free to ask me anything about my research or even get to know me on a personal level. I have have a lot to tell.
