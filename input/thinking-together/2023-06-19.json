In data governance, with the exception of things like GDPR, you usually have control over the rules. If they are hard to implement, you can rewrite them. So I'm curious whether there is a pain point in data governance around automating and demonstrating compliance with written rules, _in the terms of those written rules_. For instance, if it was possible to run something in CI\/CD that would take test inputs and outputs, detect data policy violations, and flag them _with a link to the written policy they violate_... is that anything? Does that make anyone's life better? Or is that like a hat on a hat?",

The thing that the tool I am working on offers is an easier and more verifiable symmetry between written rules and their encoded equivalent. That tends to be most useful when following the rules is very important, but the requirements and text of the rule are not under your control, and the rules are complicated, and demonstrating adherence to them in automated systems is important. In data governance, with the exception of things like GDPR, you usually have control over the rules. If they are hard to implement, you can rewrite them. So I'm curious whether there is a pain point in data governance around automating and demonstrating compliance with written rules, "
