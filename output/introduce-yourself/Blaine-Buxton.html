I stumbled on to "Future of Coding" podcast through an interest in Orca for music. I've been making my way backwards through the podcast and feel like I've found my community. I've long been frustrated with programming tools after I left Smalltalk professionally. There's something to a lively environment that old Lisp and Smalltalk systems gave you. I have always wanted to get "modern" tools up to that standard where you thought only of the problem you were trying to solve. My goal is experiment with keeping focus on the task at hand and not the idiosyncrasies of the language or IDE. Excited to find like minded individuals and hope to participate in the future with others on projects.
