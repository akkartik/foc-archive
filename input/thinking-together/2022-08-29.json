And I'd feel good about the result if the system can automatically generate AI players of different skill level and disposition based off the rules.

Complexity comes in managing state well: phases of a turn, turns combining into rounds, phases, matches.  Some combinatorial trickiness: sets and runs.  And I'd feel good about the result if the system can automatically generate AI players of different skill level and disposition based off the rules.  I mean given this set of rules, you could have an \"aggressive\" player who tries to do this and this."
