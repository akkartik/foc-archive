Jakob Nielsen asserts that accessibility has failed to serve disabled users because of a mistaken focus on standards. This approach is unable to address the wide variety of disabilities, and because it is by definition a derivative of a GUI, it is doomed to provide a second-class experience to e.g. blind users. He points out differing needs by older and less literate users, and proposes generative UI as a promising solution.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.uxtigers.com/post/accessibility-generative-ui">https://www.uxtigers.com/post/accessibility-generative-ui</a><br/><br/>I was skeptical of the headline and tweet-length summaries. There has been not-insignificant backlash. The full article leaves me still skeptical but certainly willing to see where the idea of bespoke-to-one's-needs UIs could take us.

Wow, this reminds me of work I did in 1989 on "intelligent user interfaces" for a company called EASAMS, my first graduate job.<br/><br/>It didn't get anywhere because (a) neural networks and AI generally weren't up to it and (b) the in-house sponsors didn't really think it was worth further time investment.<br/><br/>I'm struggling to remember the details, but it was about inferring the user's intentions and goals, then adjusting the UI in real time to support them. So the UI became an extension of the user.<br/><br/>In its simplest incarnation, to get over those moments when you shout at the computer "but you already knew that!!!"

it always reminds me of the ramp VS bionic legs thing.<br/>let's say your venue has some stairs at the front door, and people in wheelchairs struggle to enter it, there are various things you can do:<br/>• carry the person up the stairs.<br/>• add a ramp (in addition to the stairs).<br/>• replace the ramp with some stairs (and never build stairs again).<br/>This is a common example that gets taught in teacher training for how to think about accessibility in the classroom (context: i used to work in Special Educational Needs).<br/><br/>the best option in this metaphor is to <em>start</em> by building a ramp, then everyone can enter together, and you don't have to do any extra work, and everyone can be independent.<br/><br/>I've been using this metaphor recently in tech accessibility, because the proposed solution is often something like:<br/>• build an AI assisted Iron Man megasuit that lets the person fly<br/>in this case, thats what it seems like to me. I guess there's a common mentality that technology will be the <em><b>only</b></em> answer to all our problems. I quote: "Supporting Disabled Users <b>Requires</b> Generative UI".<br/>i think that we need ramps, not iron man suits, which requires societal change, not technological change

Consider the intrinsic potential malleability of software compared to the rigidity of the built environment.  Perhaps the software equivalent to the ramp is the ability to <em><b>easily</b></em> perform one-off customizations of things.  Hmm, concrete real examples...

Maybe this is my Iron Man suit Mark 0 since all of these are hacks around general UI limitations:<br/>1. I want to load the audio of some page into my podcast player.  In instances that are relevant to me, I can from my browser type Command+Shift+C, select an element near the play button, look for an <tt>&lt;audio&gt;</tt> tag, copy a URL, and then past into Overcast's Uploads form.<br/>2. I want to extract text from an image.  I press Command+Shift+0 and Screenotate tries its best.<br/>3. I need to use a website in a language I mostly don't know.  I select text, and then click on the Google Translate button that appears whenever I do this... except when I can't select the text, then I fall back to a combination of (1) and (2).<br/>4. I just wanted to do this right now, but don't have the tooling for it.  But if I did, I could say to my LLM, "On this page, select the year 2022, download the documents for the four quarters that appear.  Then repeat for 2023." — If any of you have a tool that does that, please, please let me know.<br/>I guess the common thread is that I want to be able to choose what I do with software without its participation or consent.

I don't know if the ramp vs stairs analogy is useful here. In software, what's a ramp to some people is a wall to others. An audio interface that helps visually impaired people does nothing for the deaf. If you try to accommodate them both with touch, you'll lose quadriplegics. There's no intersection of interaction capability.

One of the problems with this approach is the inconsistency of the UI. People always need to learn the UI a little bit. Unless the AI is perfectly deterministic, which it won't be, it'll make little changes to the UI, maybe even time. This is an even worse version of the constant human-driven UI changes that users already hate with burning passion and contempt.<br/><br/>Related: the UI will be impossible to document, and almost impossible to help anyone with. People can't necessarily share their knowledge about it between them. Even official support will probably involve screensharing at best; I have no idea how that works for people with disabilities. Good luck writing support scripts (actually we can take that one as a silver lining, but companies won't like it).

Re: the ramp analogy, it doesn't take into account Nielsen's point that critiques accessibility standards for being a derivative of the non-accessible design. I acknowledge DeConinck's counterargument that "Before you design your interface, you could make a plain text outline", which would make the accessibility approach...somewhat less of a derivative? Still. What proportion of the web is built that way? When I estimate the proportion I think we could achieve, the analogy that comes to mind is more elevators than ramps. I'm pro-elevator but we can't just hand-wave away the effort of redesigning our built environment and ways of working.

DeConinck:<br/>&gt; In other words, <em>some</em> users get the full experience, the one with all the words, all the context, and all the options. But if Nielsen’s AI thinks you have a disability, you’ll get a different experience, a <em>simpler</em> experience that’s more appropriate for <em>people like you</em>. It’s an ugly kind of paternalism with a new AI twist.<br/>In contexts where I have been disabled, yes — this is precisely what I wanted. Less context, less precise, more gist, simpler, more appropriate for someone like me.<br/><br/>Where I diverge from his vision of how this has to work is that I want control over the algorithm to be in my hands. I say what my needs are today, with all knobs available to be tuned.<br/><br/>&gt; Since it’s <em>just too hard</em> to follow accessibility best practices—plain language, a coherent document structure, support for a broad set of user agents—let’s just design UIs for us regular people and let the algorithm dumb it down for the edge cases.<br/>You literally cannot persuade the German people to write in plain language with a coherent document structure. It's not a realistic proposal; yes it is too hard. I would prefer a harm reduction strategy that works around the reality that UIs are designed for "regular people" [sic] and alternatives must be based on that fundament.

In your hands as the end user? I don't think that's what Nielsen is talking about. I don't think it's all that likely, either. Most companies aren't interested in offering the full featured APIs to their customers that would be needed to make that work. They could do that today if they wanted, but they don't.<br/><br/>If you mean in your hands as a developer, that's not even a hypothetical for accessible HTML or outline-oriented UI, you can do that right now. So I don't see how that puts generative UI ahead, either.

The ramp example (however suitable it may be as an analogy for software) actually illustrates the absence of a universal solution for accessibility problems. There are people who can use stairs but not ramps, because their ankles are too stiff to deal with the slope.

An angle perhaps missing from consideration here, but gestured at, is assistive technology, like screen zoom, screen readers, braille displays, voice control, etc. <br/><br/>They offer alternative modes of mediation between person and interface.

I'm still team ramp TBH. ie: i believe we've had the technology for accessibility for a long time. a new and even more complicated and even more expensive technology is not going to be the thing that makes accessibility better. if anything, i think the natural inclination (as we see here) is to use it as an excuse to care less about accessibility. am i just being cynical?

Ramps are a honking great idea, let's do more of those. I just don't think they're a total solution. I don't think there can be one.

Related to building ramps, the 1st edition of "Teaching Accessible Computing" was just released and is free to the public!<br/><br/>> For computing to work for everyone, it must be accessible to everyone. Alas, it is not: people with disabilities in mobility, vision, hearing, learning, attention, and more regularly face software that is hard or impossible for them to use. One reason for this is that when we educate future software engineers, we rarely teach them anything about accessibility. This limits their ability to find and fix accessibility defects and advocate to their organization to prioritize those fixes. More importantly, it limits the capacity of software organizations to design software that is accessible from day one.<br/><a href="https://bookish.press/tac">https://bookish.press/tac</a>

My sort of trite way of framing it:<br/><br/>&gt; Whereas mobile-first design and development invited folks to think more expansively about the physical reality of the devices people use, <b>accessibility-first design and development invites folks to think more expansively about the lived experiences, and physical reality of actual people.</b>

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Lu Wilson</span> I agree that many accessibility issues can be solved with old and well-known tech. I think it doesn‘t happen because people don‘t look at the tech from that perspective. And for the hard-core tech people, accessibility is not a priority because there is no glory to be found there.

When Nielsen talks about the UI being completely different for every user, and even on every use of the app, he only stops to soothe the designer. This is wildly off-track to me: the ability to become familiar with and make the app predictable is really important to several classes of disabled users. Or for that matter, all users! Who wants a UI that changes on them all the time? I’m also very intrigued how he envisages support working, both at the local scale by those surrounding disabled users, and “at scale” by app builders serving their customers
