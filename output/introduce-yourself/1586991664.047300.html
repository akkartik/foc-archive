helo everyone, my name is joreg. i am working on a visual live programming environment called vvvv. this started out as my diploma thesis in 2001 and now with a team of 5 in berlin/germany we're still on the same mission: with "visual" we mean node-based and with "live" we mean state hot-reload and we're much concerned with helping developers getting things done quickly.<br/>the language is called VL and has features known from dataflow, OOP and functional programming. it is built on .NET, meaning it can easily be extended by writing nodes in C# or F# and you can also simply use any .NET library just like you would in C#: every function turning into a node... <br/><br/>please have a look at it here: <a href="http://visualprogramming.net/">http://visualprogramming.net/</a> (free, unrestricted download for non-commercial use. windows only for now) or see it in action in these beginner tutorials: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBTgwgsWWcT_VMMrwsy3Ao7_ubazEGL4s">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBTgwgsWWcT_VMMrwsy3Ao7_ubazEGL4s</a><br/><br/>i'd be curious to hear your feedback! and in general am interested in anything visualprogramming. anyone around here also with a focus on that?

Welcome @iorec, a bunch of people here are interested in visual programming. Check this awesome repo with a bunch of examples of visual programming tools <a href="https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex">https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex</a>

Hi, welcome! Thanks Daniel for linking to that repo — I was just about to, haha.<br/><br/>vvvv is a very neat project, and I've always wanted to play with it, but I'm a Mac devotee. I'm sure you get this question a lot, but is there a Mac version on the roadmap?<br/><br/>You'll find a good number of folks here are interested in visual programming and related ideas, and come at it from many angles. Feel free to share anything interesting you find or make over in #thinking-together, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the field.

Welcome to the group. You guys have done a first class job on the product. It's too bad you picked an abomination like .NET to build upon. I have managed to avoid .NET for 20 years and I think i can make it the rest of the way without learning it.. haha. Nice to see particles as a fundamental data type. You can tell right off that your system will be great at spraying stuff around the screen. Anyway this is the place to hang out as there are numerous next gen language authors here (most of the big ones except Red and Luna which live in their own Discord worlds).

Hi Joreg and welcome! :slightly_smiling_face: It is good to have you here.  I am interested in visual programming and how to make one that is actually widely used by non experts. The history of visual programming is long but few really succeed, and vvvv is one of them. Some other successful ones that I take inspiration from are PureData/MaxMSP on the same kind of visuals than vvvv and Scratch/Blockly which have their own merits in representing programs.

Anyway, to come back to vvvv, I would love to try it, I haven't took a look since a long time and the video show new features/visuals that are very interesting!! Too sad I am on Linux... So I'll wait!

As it is based on .Net, is there a plan to target the web with WebAssembly using Blazor? Or maybe with a time sensitive thing like vvvv it is too complicated?

Blazor is currently interpeted, so who knows... Welcome iorec... my stuff is also based on .NET, and due to my area of research (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqm2Eip884E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqm2Eip884E</a> and <a href="http://ecsharp.net">ecsharp.net</a> and <a href="http://core.loyc.net">core.loyc.net</a>) I am curious what you use as a serialization format for vvvv "source code". Can you output the vvvv program as C# code, or as an assembly DLL that can be consumed by C#/VB programs?

@Iorec, I don't anything about Matrix but if it garbles edited replies and doesn't support replying to threads, you should join Slack instead. What I said before is, my stuff is also based on .NET, and due to my area of research (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqm2Eip884E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqm2Eip884E</a> and <a href="http://ecsharp.net">ecsharp.net</a> and <a href="http://core.loyc.net">core.loyc.net</a>) I am curious what you use as a serialization format for vvvv "source code".

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Eddy Parkinson</span>: vvvv's initial niche (starting with our first release in 2002) is making "interactive media installations". this is what we do with it ourselves and that is the scene we knew and introduced vvvv to. with vvvv gamma we're hoping to reach a far wider audience. while we still have a focus on realtime 3d graphics and any kind of device IO, vvvv gamma is much less limited to that than vvvv beta was.<br/>VL (the language used in vvvv gamma) is a proper .NET language just like c# and f#, and as such allows direct interop with other .NET languages. but it adds two distinguishing features: it is visual and allows for live-coding. both aspects we believe can significantly speed up development time for a lot of use cases. so .NET developer in general is one target audience that we hope to hear from.<br/>and then we're hoping to see it picked up in various other niches that we don't know of yet and that we then can help build specific node-libraries to further advance their usecases.
