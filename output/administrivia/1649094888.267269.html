Couple of folks posting very <em>promotional</em> messages in #introduce-yourself today. I'm deleting them and reaching out to the authors where appropriate, so if it seems like stuff is disappearing that's what's happening.<br/><br/>I'm tempted to post a message there saying "Hey â€” be cool" (in a few more words). But I get the sense that the folks coming here just to link spam aren't the sort of folks who will bother to read up the channel. So for the time being, I'm just going to be liberally applying the delete key and privately reaching out if it feels like the poster has a chance of being sincere in their interest in our community.
