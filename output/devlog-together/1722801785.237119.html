Hi, Because I want to understand better how neural networks work and can be trained, the best way to do is, is by building a small one from scratch myself and training it.<br/>In this video <a href="https://youtu.be/TG9TGqM9HCs">https://youtu.be/TG9TGqM9HCs</a> I show creating and connecting a few neural-nodes together and a show a very small prebuilt neural network.<br/><br/>To be able to do this, I've created 4 new node-types in my visual programming system: neural-input-node, neural-bias-node, neural-node and neural-output-node.. the first 3 output weighted connections. This means that a weight property is attached to the connection and can be changed.. the neural-node and neural-output-node use these weights in there respective calculations.<br/><br/>The neural-node currently uses sigmoid as its activation function.<br/>The neural-bias-node only outputs a value of 1 and the output value of a neural-input-node can be changed. When any of these values are changed, they propagate forward through the network.<br/>In the current example flow, an error is also calculated using an expression node-type depending on the output and expected value.<br/>The white object-node is also a new node-type and can be used to obtain multiple values and output them in a single object.<br/><br/>In the near future I hope to implement a neural network that can be trained with the mnist digit dataset, but I have to do a lot more work before I am at that stage I think.
