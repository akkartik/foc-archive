Consider the Able Services facilities management company from the article.  Suppose Squibb has purchased a most remarkable, intelligent, loose end tying, project management automating system.  Let's call this agent "Consultant".  Even for Consultant (who understands plain and not so plain English, who asks questions, who gives feedback) to be useful to Squibb's team, they need to be able to tell Consultant what the types of buildings are, what kind of employee can do what job, what constraints there are on schedules – you know, the business logic.  Said "logic" is unlikely to be found in any one spreadsheet, document, or person.  More likely than not, the individual conceptual ingredients – even after being distilled from the individuals and placed on the table – don't combine into a coherent whole.  Getting those ideas sorted out amounts to bridging a conceptual complexity gap.
