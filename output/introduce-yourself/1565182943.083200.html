Hi all! I'm interested in rekindling my love for programming. Somewhere there is a sense of wonder long beaten down by excessive pragmatism since that's what's hot these days.  Is it possible to reconcile these forces when there is too little time and languages and toolsets take time to adopt but most be only superficially different from each other to become mainstream? Let's find out! :smile:<br/><br/>A coworker told me about this group.<br/><br/>I currently mostly do ocaml and python, and some C#.  I love/hate emacs and am trying to do more in VS Code going forward.

Have you noticed a trend where functional, declarative, and imperative languages are slowly adopting the best parts of each other? I see this happening in JavaScript and C# adopting map/reduce and haskell-like pattern matching and destructuring, for example. There was an interesting video about all this, if I can find it.<br/><br/>Also, I think Rust is like someone took a lot of those ideas and re-did C with them.

yes, definitely.  I did clojure for a time, then noticed java pick up streams, then kotlin taking it a little further in the FP direction but still similar enough to be popular.

It's fun to be an early tech adopter, but also risky.  The number of devs, jobs and amount of libs/frameworks is smaller. When the company I was at was being shopped around for acquisitions, some potential buyers wouldn't touch not-java.  Some other jobs I took later made it apparent managers care more about risk than individual productivity.
