I'm currently teaching introductory CS (Python) and AI\/ML exercises at Tokyo Institute of Technology. Originally I've studied (and had a PhD on) Natural Language Processing, but eventually got bored of it so I moved into Software Engineering. Why? I've always been interested in studying the meaning of a language, but found out that so many NLP researchers are afraid of even using the word \"meaning\" because it's such a loaded word there! I assumed that the meaning in software world was a bit better defined... only to find out that the meaning of functions and identifiers are still very murky area here. Still, I hope to bring some of the insights I've got in NLP to the SE field. For now, I'm mainly working on a program comprehension of a large project. I also worked on developing assistive tools for blind people, and am interested in accessibility tools for blind programmers. My hobby is developing game engines and open source tools (<https:\/\/github.com\/euske>). This community looks fun and I'm grateful to be here. Cheers!\nEdit: typo on my university name - oops.",
