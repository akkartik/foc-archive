I hadn't watched this before now. While I've heard a handful of different criticisms of PARC over the years, this one resonated with me particularly strongly. It's an interesting lens — of course Xerox the paper copier company would produce a research lab that turned computers into glorified paper copiers! If it's not a stretch to say so (it is), this story rhymes with the strategy for privatizing government-run services like healthcare in Canada: gradually open up the field for private competition, which lets corporations claim the profitable parts (Eg: elective surgeries) while the government-owned hospitals and such are left holding the bag on the more costly parts (Eg: emergency, recovery). In the case of the Alto and then the Macintosh, it's the easy-to-translate tasks that became the desktop metaphor, and the costly parts were left to the terminal, Algol-derived languages, or manual effort on the part of the user. If only the rush to privatize and productize computing hadn't happened, and we had computers designed to empower experts rather than just clerks and children.<br/><br/>Of course, the vision pursued by Nelson (et al.) of much richer end-user programming is so foreign to me that I find myself overwhelmed imagining the complexity of it, unable to envision what it might feel like to actually have lived my whole life using such a system.

Nelson makes no distinction between the Macintosh GUI and Xerox Parc's Smalltalk environment. He calls them both "the PUI". They are different! Between 8:15 and 8:21, Nelson says: "Xerox Parc took away the right to program". That is absolutely and categorically false. Smalltalk is one of the most powerful end user programming environments ever developed. It was Steve Jobs, not Xerox Parc, who took away the right to program.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> The Alto was microprogrammable, and there were different operating systems that could run on it. When I had my Xerox Parc tour, I only talked to the Smalltalk group, so maybe I saw different things than what Nelson saw. When you used Smalltalk, it essentially was the operating system. You couldn't change the microcode or the Smalltalk virtual machine using live programming in the Smalltalk environment, but everything else could be changed. Alan Kay and other members of the Smalltalk team talked about how they were going to do away with applications and do away with the operating system (the whole concept of an operating system was a mistake, they said). So I strongly disagree with Nelson blaming Xerox Parc for the tyranny of the OS and the application.

I don't think Xerox Parc invented the application. Some early-ish personal computer applications were Electric Pencil in 1976, WordStar in 1978, Visicalc in 1979. But the oldest application that I am aware of is Ivan Sutherland's CAD program "Sketchpad" in 1963.

The Xerox Star was a commercial product created by the Xerox Systems Development Department (SDD) in El Segundo. This was a different group from PARC (Palo Alto Research Center). The Star was essentially a prototype for the Apple Lisa and Macintosh, and it had all of the features that Nelson is criticizing, and blaming PARC for. The Star had a file based operating system, and desktop GUI environment with a trash can, icons, applications.

The Alto definitely had a "paper metaphor". It had a high resolution bitmap display, it displayed black text on a white background, you had a choice of fonts. You could mix text and graphics arbitrarily, just like paper. They did this in an era when paper was a much richer visual display medium than computer monitors. They were consciously simulating paper, and Nelson is attacking them for this. But the user interfaces they created using this paper metaphor looked graphically better than anything else at the time.<br/><br/>Some PARC people were seconded to SDD for the development of the Star. By my recollection, the "desktop" metaphor, as I understand it, with file and application and folder icons on the deskop, and a trashcan, first appeared in the Star. I could be wrong, but I'd like to see primary sources that prove otherwise.

The Xerox Alto had a 3 button mouse. There were seven "chords" that you could use, which gave you 7 kinds of mouse clicks. These 7 chords were assigned to different user interface functions, and the mapping changed based on context. This wasn't user friendly, so the Xerox Star simplified down to a 2 button mouse, and the Macintosh simplified further down to a 1 button mouse. There was a lot of UI design work that had to be done to take the raw ideas from the Xerox Alto and make them user friendly, and the result of all that UI design work is the modern desktop metaphor.

Part of Steve Jobs work to make the Macintosh user friendly was to make it non-programmable. So I would claim that it all went wrong at Apple. The supervillian who destroyed our end-user-programming FoC future was Steve Jobs, not Alan Kay.

I was the original author of WordStar 2000, the sequel to the pioneering WordStar product which was a massive success. When visiting the offices of the company, they had purchased a Xerox Star machine, which was $50,000 at the time. Although Xerox had a crack R&amp;D dept., the upper management of Xerox was full of idiots who had no clue how to enter a new business area. Through management incompetence, they failed to take advantage of their huge head start. Commodore was a typewriter company that also failed to understand computers and blew it bad. If you put a bad jockey on the fastest horse you will still lose. Leadership matters more than anything, and Xerox had a long series of bad leaders, just like IBM had after Watson retired.<br/><br/>By the way, Prof. Wirth of ETH who invented Pascal, Modula-2 and Oberon took a sabbatical at Xerox Parc, and after that built his own computer called the Lilith machine which was very interesting, and was the closest thing to interchangeable parts and not a strong boundary between OS and applications that Nelson would have liked.<br/><br/>Nelson also didn't mention that 3Com which pioneered ethernet also came out of PARC. Xerox has the unfortunate distinction of the company with the most inventions not commercialized due to their stupidity. The management was basically running a gold mine that discovered diamonds and threw them away.

They didn't even take ownership stakes in the spinoff companies. If they hadn't wanted to go into that business, they at least could have been the VC for the spinoffs. The leaders' mistakes should be studied so that people can learn from it. If they had just bought 10% of 3Com, Adobe, Apple, etc., those shares would be worth 10x what Xerox is worth today. And as an interesting side note, Xerox is attempting to buy HP because they finally decided to enter the computer business! hah what a joke, they are 40 years late to the party ;-)

An alternative take on the “who ruined the computer”: The problem was neither taking away or granting full modification access. It was the failure to recognize that both are necessary. We need both barriers and means to securely cross them. From this perspective, everyone on either far side of the debate would be responsible for this deep problem.

Yes, cut &amp; paste was invented by Larry Tesler at PARC. He later went to Apple to work on the Macintosh.<br/><br/>In TextEdit on the Macintosh, I can select some text, then drag &amp; drop the selected text to another location. It seems like this is the kind of UI that Nelson is advocating. But I generally don't use this feature, because it becomes awkward if the text has to travel a long distance, especially if I have to scroll a long distance in the document to find the destination for the text I am moving.<br/><br/>PARC-style cut copy &amp; paste is simple, easy and works. People have implemented "better" systems but they always more complicated, and fail to catch on. Can you provide a link where Nelson demonstrates a better UI?

Nope..<br/><br/>It's more than just the UI used to manage the clipboard hidey hole. It's partly that there's just one hidey hole, but even that doesn't quite capture the breadth of his criticism. Ted's asking for the OS to provide a framework for parts of documents that can be given mutable but persistent locations, akin to a desktop or bedroom floor. They can be moved around, they stay in one place unless moved around, and you can see where they moved from.<br/><br/>Seen through this lens it's immediately clear to me -- in a way it never was before -- why he cares so much about transclusion.

Maybe I'm just too cognitively captured by the PUI, but Ted seems obsessed with cut and paste out of all perspective. Pre-computer professionals were forced to cut and paste manuscripts because writing up the manuscript all over again was hard work. The computer takes the drudgery out of this mechanical work, and Ted Nelson seems reactionary for ignoring this. At the same time he's obsessed with the fact that computers enable tracking the provenance of each little clipping, something no writer cared about in his beloved pre-computer days.<br/><br/>When people cut and pasted pieces of paper while rewriting, the pieces of paper gradually degraded. One had to periodically take a pasted-up manuscript and type it up all over again to get it on new paper and start the cycle of cutting and pasting all over again. Computers emphasize the retyping phases and ignore the cutting-and-pasting phases of the life cycle. That seems reasonable to me.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> Yes, I understand your point about "classic" cut and paste, and why transclusion is important. As for tracking the provenance of each clipping, it's not true that "no writer cared" about this in pre-computer days. Consider the Zettelcasten system, which accomplishes exactly this using paper. Or consider the "associative trails" in Vannevar Bush's "Memex" machine (proposed in 1945), which I know was a big influence on Nelson.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> said:<br/><br/>&gt; It's partly that there's just one hidey hole, but even that doesn't quite capture the breadth of his criticism. Ted's asking for the OS to provide a framework for parts of documents that can be given mutable but persistent locations, akin to a desktop or bedroom floor. They can be moved around, they stay in one place unless moved around, and you can see where they moved from.<br/>I get to enjoy this exact mode of working when I edit video and audio. For instance, here (below) is a screenshot from the Orca podcast episode. At the bottom, in the clip editor, you see the full source audio recording. In the middle of the screen, in the main "arrangement" view, you see all the ways I've cut up and rearranged that source audio into the final product, stripping out some pauses where they felt bad, adding in pauses where they felt good, cutting out a tremendous amount of stuttering and false starts and tangents.<br/><br/>When I'm editing thousand-line source files, or documentation, or blog posts, I often use copy-and-paste in a similar (but less richly supported) way — I keep a scratchpad document open next to my main document, and whenever I cut something but don't know where it's going, I paste it to the scratchpad. Nothing ever stays in the hidey hole, because that's a recipe for lost work. But I often find myself in the situation where I rearrange the document, leave it for a week, come back with fresh eyes.. and realize the flow of thoughts is worse than it was before. I suspect that what Ted is asking for would help with this, by allowing me to "view things as they were" with a little more interactivity than just undo/redo or version history.

&gt; Like <a href="https://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/09.html#Chap09">Doug Engelbart</a>, whose work he had yet to learn about, Nelson yearned for more than a lazy man's typewriter. They both wanted the freedom to steer their thought paths in new ways. And Ted especially desired the prerogative of changing his mind. He wanted the freedom to insert and delete words and move paragraphs around, but he also wanted the computer to <em>remember</em> his decision path. One of the specs was for something he called "historical backtrack," in which the computer could quickly show him the various earlier alternative versions of his ever-changing text.<br/>From "Tools for Thought" by Howard Rheingold, who I believe was a friend of both Nelson and Engelbart. <a href="https://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/14.html#Chap14">https://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/14.html#Chap14</a>

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> said:<br/>&gt;  I get to enjoy this exact mode of working when I edit video and audio<br/>Exactly. Actually the movies are a big influence of Ted Nelson’s work. His father was a director and his mother was an oscar winning actress. When he describes <em>xanadocs</em>, he mentions that they’re based on EDLs (Edit Decision Lists, a term brought from film edition). The idea is, you create a set of “clips” of anything, and that’s what you cut and paste and rearrange. At that level of detail, it’s possible to work quite fluidly, as film edition software proves.

The undo command was hidden in applications and "There was no operating system undo in any way". I think this is key to Nelson's idea of an OS, which is more like an <b>integrated</b> hypermedia system, where you remix media of same (text-text) or different (text-image) kinds, while preserving provenance and history of changes. While there likely differences between the Alto and the Mac, neither is particularly like a single hypermedia system - you're always working within 'windows', while Nelson talks about drawing lines 'across windows'. I think Nelson is the original 'no silos/no apps' voice. There were still isolated 'apps' on the Alto, no (e.g. Bravo)? And hierarchical file systems, no? The criticism of taking away the terminal may be overstated though. Much of what Nelson says resonates very strongly with me.
