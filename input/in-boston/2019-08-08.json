Based on the feedback from the first meeting, it seemed like we wanted to try a mix of:\n\n- *Showcase* work in progress stuff (or just neat demos of things you’ve found online you’re inspired by)\n- *Discuss* a specific topic, with links to reading materials beforehand so everyone can get context (and people who have 0 interest in the topic can feel comfortable skipping)\n\nI think the next step here is to get topic suggestions for everyone for the *Discuss* piece. Then, we can do a quick Slack poll and converge on a topic (or 2!)\n\n*If you’d like to propose a topic for discussion, please comment on this thread!*",
