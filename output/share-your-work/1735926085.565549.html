my team and i have a little bit heretical take on the future of coding, which is that all the accidental complexity for building so much useful stuff comes from systems integration these days, not the programming language or environment so much. we've been hard at work on a systems-integrated development platform, and are now just launching our take on AI, starting with full app-at-a-time app generation. it takes advantage of all the systems integration we've done to produce apps that have real, working frontends, backends, data storage, auth, caching, apis, etc, and does it the hard way such that you can fully fiddle with all the code and make just about anything. curious what you all think! here's the preview and link: <a href="https://x.com/hashemito/status/1875196717639033101">https://x.com/hashemito/status/1875196717639033101</a> , DM me if you want early access i will let all you smart folks in!
