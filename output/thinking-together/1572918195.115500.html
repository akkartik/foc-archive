[from John Hanacek's "As We May Sketch"]<br/>In Don Norman’s “The Design of Everyday Things” he provides ‘principles of good design,’ which are:<br/><br/><li> <b>Visibility</b>. By looking, the user can tell the state of the device and the alternatives for action.<br/><li> <b>A good conceptual model</b>. The designer provides a good conceptual model for the user, with consistency in the presentation of operations and results and a coherent, consistent system image.<br/><li> <b>Good mappings</b>. It is possible to determine the relationships between actions and results, between controls and their effects, and between the system state and what is visible.<br/><li> <b>Feedback</b>. The user receives full and continuous feedback about the results of actions.

Traditional “typed statement” programming environments live up to none of these criteria. In traditional programming it is often very difficult to determine relationships between operations and results. The feedback is not continuous and because of syntax constraints often a program being modified is not in a state where you can see the results. Systems like spreadsheets are better, since they offer easier to choose alternatives and usually allow you to see the results with just a click, providing a nicefeedback loop. Norman concludes that with spreadsheets “it felt as if you were working directly on the problem, not on a computer.”

• Could I have a development environment that would let me get my ideas into code much faster so that I can focus on trying more complicated logic through the manipulation of visuals that provide constant feedback?<br/>• Can we drive this environment with pen input to use interactive sketching to help elucidate the concepts of programming?<br/>• Can we create visual metaphors for programming concepts, like objects and dependencies, that users can manipulate in a direct way such as in software with similar affordances of Adobe Illustrator?<br/>• Could such an environment allow younger children to organically discover how to realize their imaginations using computers?
