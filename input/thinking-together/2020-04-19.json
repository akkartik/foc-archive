        "text": "This post by Dorian Taylor &lt;<https:\/\/doriantaylor.com\/agile-as-trauma|https:\/\/doriantaylor.com\/agile-as-trauma>&gt; makes a few connections I found interesting: \n\n1. Framing the agile movement as a response to trauma — I suspect many other things in our industry could be framed that way?\n2. Composition naturally leads to iterative process — not sure if that “naturally” there is justified, but certainly an observation to ponder.\n3. How collaboration is such an important part of the agile approach although “programming itself is a quasi-solipsistic activity. A programmer requires, strictly speaking, no more collaboration than does a novelist or painter.”\n4. “[T]he presence of a feature can only indicate to a user if a goal is possible, behaviour will determine how painful it will be to achieve it.” and “[Behavior] blurs the line between “fixing bugs” and “building features”, and coalesces the two into a unitary process of “sculpting behaviour”.\n1. “Even in a world after programmers, there will still be the work of figuring out—albeit no longer in code—just what you want to tell the computer to do for you—how you want it to behave. There are still a lot of decisions to make aside from what framework you write it in, or whether you use NoSQL, or how you lay out the source tree. If you eliminate the decisions that involve getting the artifact to work at all, the remaining decisions are going to involve whether it works better one way than another. Most of these decisions are going to be the result of trial and error, and a sizable chunk of those are going to involve feedback from users.”\nAnd he touched a few other things we talked about here before.",

Framing the agile movement as a response to trauma — I suspect many other things in our industry could be framed that way?\n2. Composition naturally leads to iterative process — not sure if that “naturally” there is justified, but certainly an observation to ponder.\n3. How collaboration is such an important part of the agile approach although “programming itself is a quasi-solipsistic activity. A programmer requires, strictly speaking, no more collaboration than does a novelist or painter.”\n4. “[T]he presence of a feature can only indicate to a user if a goal is possible, behaviour will determine how painful it will be to achieve it.” and “[Behavior] blurs the line between “fixing bugs” and “building features”, and coalesces the two into a unitary process of “sculpting behaviour”.\n"

There are still a lot of decisions to make aside from what framework you write it in, or whether you use NoSQL, or how you lay out the source tree. If you eliminate the decisions that involve getting the artifact to work at all, the remaining decisions are going to involve whether it works better one way than another. Most of these decisions are going to be the result of trial and error, and a sizable chunk of those are going to involve feedback from users.”"

That's reasonable as a goal for this particular page. (It's also why I find this page unsatisfying.) But it also seems reasonable for it to trigger conversations about the how. That doesn't feel like \"missing the point\". Isn't that sort of conversation what this page is designed to engender?\nYes, completely agreed. The mission page is trying to act as a list of ideals to aim for (and they aren't set in stone either, I'm sure they'll change and improve through feedback like this). It's great to see people talking about how they could be achieved, which goals are more important to them, etc.\n\n&gt; Perhaps it will help to triangulate by bringing up my mission: <http:\/\/akkartik.name\/about>. Not to brag, but we're attacking highly overlapping if not isomorphic problems. By definition I should have addressed any shortcomings I bring up here. It stays high-level, focuses on goals, but also indicates the sorts of trade-offs I'm willing to make. I'd love to receive similar criticism from you about what it's lacking.\nI agree, there's a good amount of overlap between the malleable principles and your own mission. Seems like we should continue to chat and compare notes as our efforts evolve. :smile:\n\nAbout your own mission page, overall I think it's quite good! My initial comments are only about stylistic things like making section headers more visually distinct, since my ADHD-addled brain found it hard to scan. I think with a personal mission (like your page), where you're describing your personal vision, it makes sense to link goals, constraints, and solutions together like you have done.\n\nFor the malleable site, I'd like many different voices to contribute their own views, constraints, and solutions, so that's why I've been saying they make more sense to be separate elements from the list of ideals there: I expect there to be many different answers as different people get involved. For now, I'd like to at least collect such perspectives and encourage more discussion.\n\n&gt; Perhaps it would help to drill down into which comments you consider to be missing the point. It might require a private conversation, but it might help make this conversation more concrete.\nThere's a background level of startup-y noise in there, such as <https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=22858840>, but I never read HN these days, so perhaps that's actually a low amount of such things for the site. :sweat_smile:\n\nI agree there's useful feedback in there as well. :smile: Thanks for picking out those various threads and summarising the sentiment. I agree with your take on the ones you selected. I'll add them to my list of feedback to sift through for the future.",

The main reasons for me were to\n1) add another voice to ideas that I think are good\n2) think through, clarify and organize some my thoughts - required when publishing (I find this also helps me 'move beyond' the specific idea to other ideas)\n3) find folks interested in similar stuff and get comments, conversation and further evolution of the ideas\n\nSpecially wrt 3, I've been _very_ happy with the comments threads that have built up on some pages.\n\nI dont think one needs fully formed coherent ideas to publish. A post could be a vague idea, a proposition, a perspective etc. I would personally recommend a blog, 'digital garden' or collection of unorganized notes. This is not noise, I think, but just an space folks who so desire may visit, absorb, reflect and optionally comment. People are good at filtering. Just now I found <https:\/\/twitter.com\/szymon_k\/status\/1251887893938929665> and really like browsing this kind of collection, and looking at the various connections the author has made.",
