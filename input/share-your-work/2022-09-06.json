The idea of a UI Server is to wrap everything related to the “frontend” of a typical frontend\/backend modern app and offer it as a simple to use service. This includes an extensive UI component library and services like authentication, localization, theming etc.\n\nThis approach removes massive amount of complexity (CSS, DOM, React, bundlers, hosting, etc…) and allows us to build modern apps by solely writing a backend. The backend deals with accessing app data (eg: databases, apis etc..), app logic and uses the UI Server through a simple client SDK.\n\nCheckout a sample todo list app (only ~80 SLoC) to get a better feel for SkyMass:\n\nLive Demo: <https:\/\/skymass.dev\/app\/skymass-demo\/neon-todolist>\nSource: <https:\/\/github.com\/skymasshq\/skymass-demo\/blob\/main\/neon_todolist.mjs>",

The idea of a UI Server is to wrap everything related to the “frontend” of a typical frontend\/backend modern app and offer it as a simple to use service. This includes an extensive UI component library and services like authentication, localization, theming etc.\n\nThis approach removes massive amount of complexity (CSS, DOM, React, bundlers, hosting, etc…) and allows us to build modern apps by solely writing a backend. The backend deals with accessing app data (eg: databases, apis etc..), app logic and uses the UI Server through a simple client SDK.\n\nCheckout a sample todo list app (only ~80 SLoC) to get a better feel for SkyMass:\n\nLive Demo: "
