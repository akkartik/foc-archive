I'm really excited by the idea of bringing programming to a less technical audience, in a way that they can easily understand, whilst being based on rigorous paradigms (without making a big song and dance about that), and having their work translate down to something a professional programmer could (and would be glad to) inherit.\nI've been catching up on the podcast slowly but surely and it seems like this is a community that has much in common with me. Glad to be here!"

And\/or is it to enable you to build the next step, the visual editor, on a good foundation that matches the visual way of representing the web app?\nIt is for both of these reasons. Purely functional code is _very_ declarative, and thus is much better suited to a visual representation. I also want a safer\/simpler experience for developers. The final vision I have is very ambitious, and may not be feasible for me to achieve. In working towards that vision, as I am building the pieces required for it, those pieces should be _independently useful_ for others. If I am not successful at any given point of my journey towards the final vision, what I have built up until that point should still be a net win for me in the work that I am doing at the time.\n\n&gt; Also, what about solutions like Purescript? I am guessing you want to go with Javascript due to its popularity and how easy it is to use? That certainly makes sense, just wondering hm!\nI have considered compile-to-JS solutions, but I have issue with the community size, the ecosystem size, and the interop (they all promise 100% interop with JS on the box, but the reality is sometimes not so easy). Having said that, I'm likely to have the same challenges, there's more to interop than syntax, transpilation and module systems.\nMostly, though, the biggest concern I have is _inheritability_. I want a project that was created using my stack to be inheritable even to programmers that aren't necessarily familiar with FP. Although they may struggle to understand code they've inherited from me at first if they're not accustomed to FP, if that code is just a subset of JS, they can disable\/remove the tooling that limits the code to a subset, and carry on with the project more easily using the paradigms that they are already familiar with.\nI think this is one of the big issues with low-\/no-code tools atm, they're walled gardens: there's literally _no code_, users are just configuring an instance of the vendor's platform. I want to build something that is genuinely inheritable, not just on paper, but in a very practical sense. (there are also many other problems with no-code that I hope to tackle).\nIt is for this reason that the entire stack needs to be open source, and its pieces should strive to be independently useful. I aim to build communities around each piece so that there will be some measure of support for those that _do_ inherit from me.\n&gt; Btw. is there a way to follow your work, maybe somewhere to subscribe? If not I will just keep my eyes open here on FoC slack!\nNot yet. I've got some abstracts and notes written out (and the 1st stab at the ESLint + Flow config), but I haven't published anything.\nI'll be taking paternity leave soon (:tada:), so I hope to put together something public-facing during that downtime.\nI'll be sure to update here when that happens.",
