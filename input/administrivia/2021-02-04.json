Hopefully this announcement (of a sort) lets me release some commitments, break up a bit of an emotional logjam, and gradually get back to posting <https:\/\/twitter.com\/spiralganglion\/status\/1153777314443849728|silly GIFs>.\n\n<@UCUSW7WVD> — The relevant spot in the relevant repo is <https:\/\/github.com\/futureofcoding\/futureofcoding.org\/tree\/main\/episodes|here>. But there's nothing new to edit there yet. For the upcoming episode, I first have to finish editing the audio, then ship it away to the <https:\/\/www.rev.com|transcription service> (which <http:\/\/Repl.it|Repl.it> pays for, since it's something like $150 per episode), run some regexes to clean up the formatting, and then it goes into the repo. And then it gets edited, and then I publish the episode. (_And then_ I get to go back to the fun stuff of recording a new interview, and the mostly fun stuff of editing it.) I'm not sure exactly what the best approach to getting help with the transcripts would be. The way I work is by listening to the audio while I read the transcript, pausing frequently and making edits whenever I come across a mistranscription, an unclear bit of writing, or a spot where an inline link would be nice. I could announce the transcripts early, but then anyone offering to help wouldn't necessarily have the audio as a reference (if they wanted to work that way), and then it also wouldn't be clear to me when to actually release the episode. Or I could publish the rough transcript and show notes along with the episode, so that podcast subscribers would all hear the audio.. and then wait a while before announcing the podcast on social media (and in Mariano's newsletter), so that any interested folks could spruce up the transcript in the intervening time. Not sure what to do, open to suggestions.\n\n<@UAJKEBGP8> — If I understand what you mean by _unbundling myself,_ I've already done some of that whenever I've had the chance, and this post is me doing a bit more of that I think.\n\n• Moderating the community is totally painless, now. It takes a few seconds per day. I enjoy it. I just read the Slack as an enthusiast, and occasionally think to myself, _this post belongs in a different channel_, or, _this link preview isn't adding anything to the discussion,_ and then take a second to fix that. If it ever becomes _not painless_ again, I'm more prepared now. Our CoC <https:\/\/github.com\/futureofcoding\/code-of-conduct#scope|is written> assuming multiple moderators. The website is now in a Github org, rather than under Steve Krouse's personal account. All new services I've set up (like a Digital Ocean instance for Mariano to use for his Newsletter and tools) are intended to be easily handed over to other folks if needed.\n• Recording and editing the podcast is something I enjoy doing. It's a blast! I eventually want to do more podcasting, though with different formats, not just more interviews. But blocking me from finishing episodes at all is my commitment to great transcripts and show notes. So I'm letting go of that commitment. We will still have _an transcript_, and show notes, but I won't be doing the same writing and editing that I used to. I think this will be the unbundling that I need right now.\n• I had wanted to, starting in January, lead a community initiative to build some new tooling for us to capture and organize our thoughts — a wiki, or collaborative zettel. I'm bailing on that, at least until summer, possibly completely. It's something that'd help the community in a few ways (some folks here really could use a collaborative project), but I'm in no position to spearhead it. I think this will _also_ be the unbundling that I need right now.\n• If you can point to other duties \/ projects that I'm currently sleeping on, that someone else really ought to pick up and run with, by all means!",
