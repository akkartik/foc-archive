I've lately been thinking that many problems in software development might be communication problems and not primarily related to the specific tools used. How often do people "reinvent the wheel" just because they don't know that there's a solution for their problem or because they aren't able to change a 90% solution to fit their needs? I'm thinking that changing the way people work together to produce programs could make a big difference. In particular, I find the idea of having a wikipedia-like platform for code very interesting. Some advantages could be the low barrier to contribute or that people could refactor similar parts of different projects to use the same general solution, therefore providing a "join" operation for the "fork" model that's common in OSS development. I've got more to say about this and I'll probably write a blog post about it, but before I do, I wanted to ask you guys if you know if anyone has done something similar before. Thanks :wink:

I think the concept of a "Web of code" could be very exciting. I imagine it would be something like code blocks embedded into web pages which can be live-edited and executed, but also "bookmarked" in order for you to collect useful snippets, or "imported" into a code editor that you have open somewhere (automatically adding that code as an external package). A Wikipedia-like site would just be a search engine and wiki layer that surrounds this core idea.

I think it’s just a new way of designing how we interact with code on the regular old web, i.e. a (vastly) better UX for anyone who wants to dabble with code.

That's fair and good way to describe it.  Already on the web, we look up code (big and small), find libraries or snippets, package them up, and pull them in.  Over time this process has improved.  We have Stackoverflow instead of random forums.  We have GitHub instead of SourceForge.  CPAN-like systems are the rule rather than the exception.  What sharp edges remain?  What frictions prevent a smoother experience?

The frictions include not being able to immediately execute, experiment with, and discuss any code snippet you see <em>by default</em> (i.e. as opposed to only on special websites which embed CodePen). In this hypothetical environment, whatever changes you make can be published/bookmarked somewhere with a single click. Those changes can be made publicly visible and available for discussion. Thus we don’t have to write and run code by signing up to Github, forking and cloning to your local file system, setting up a dev environment, pushing changes upstream etc… It’s just about the UX details in my opinion.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nick Smith</span> I am enthusiastic about the general idea and have though about it a bit and hope to explore the design space a little in this conversation.<br/><br/>We have in mind a certain experience, yet being "just about the UX details" seems to underestimate the difference from what we generally do now.  You say "thus we don’t have to [set up a local] dev environment."  Do you have an entirely online experience (no local) in mind or a more of a seamless synchronization to a dedicated local client/browser?  Either seems to amount to a whole kit and caboodle, not just a better interface to an existing backend.

I'm glad that my post started a discussion. For me, the biggest difference from sth like github would be that anyone could edit stuff that others have created initially. Take documentation / tests for example: When you are writing a piece of software, you understand how it works, so documentation is mostly for making it easier for others. But if you just started, not knowing whether your program is going to be used by others or even if's going to be useful, writing documentation would slow you down without providing an immediate benefit for you. So people don't write docs in the first place. On the other hand, a user discovering a piece of code who has just figured out how it works is more likely to write some docs to make understanding easier for others. If you find a program without tests that looks promising, but you don't know if it actually does what you need, you'd probably try some examples to test it. Wouldn't it be great if you could easily contribute these tests to the program?

Easily contribute has been the barrier since — always, I suppose.  Immediately, I think what is continuous integration for if not to accommodate pull requests.  <a href="https://pantheon.io/blog/continuous-integration-pull-requests-no-distractions">https://pantheon.io/blog/continuous-integration-pull-requests-no-distractions</a>

I just imagine that everything we might want for a Code Web has been done before (in better and worse embodiments) unevenly and generally (unavailable, incompatible, or unmaintained) for our environment of choice.  So I find it helpful to keep these experiences in mind.  Are there people who would otherwise make pull requests who don't and why?  One of my Code Web daydreams centers on how to use public code and conversation about a software system to improve it.  For example, if you work on project $x, the top voted Stackoverflow questions could easily become your to-do list.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nick Smith</span> the difference I find important is that there's another concept of ownership. Github projects are owned by their maintainers and they need to accept your pull request. In a wiki system, changes are applied without anyone needing to approve beforehand. I think this would work great for comments / docs, and for code (which needs more stability), each edit could lead to a new version with references to other code snippets also targeting a specific versions. Users would manually update to new versions, probably assisted by ratings or whether an update breaks relevant tests.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@William Taysom</span> I share your daydream ;-) I think that incompatible and unmaintained projects are indeed a big problem and I think that a wiki-like system could address both. There's no unmaintained wikipedia site as long as anyone cares enough to perform changes. Incompatibility can mean a lot of things and I'm focusing on library incompatibility in the following (please correct me if you meant something else). If there are for example two projects for creating plots (like matplotlib and plotly for example), they would usually be developed by two different teams. Even if both projects shared a common core (e.g. drawing a simple line) that could be refactored, the project and team structures would most likely prevent this. In an optimal environment, anyone could search for common stuff and refactor it by replacing with a more general solution. This could evolve over time and lead to abstractions that a single person / team / company could not have come up with initially.

Fundamentally what Herr Kohlgruber is talking about is having software enter the age of interchangeable parts. This has not happened yet in the software field. It was pioneered by several inventors in the 1800's such as Eli Whitney, and was used to devastating success during the civil war, where it permitted mass-production of guns which previously had not existed.  Interchangeable parts is indeed a worth goal of any next generation product, and i consider it a crucial criteria on which to evaluate any new programming system. We know from past experience that this is a tricky issue, as programs = algorithms + data structures, and data is something people just can't seem to agree on how to store. So it won't be easy.
