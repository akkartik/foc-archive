as for the YouTube example I don't know what would fix it. Im just comparing GitHub to Youtube. On GitHub I see mostly love and sharing and on YouTube I see people posting junk for money. If you added money to GitHub in the wrong way you might get more of the effects seen on YouTube. People trying to game the ratings and stars so they get the most downloads and therefore the most money. Of course that's not the only way to use money to support open source.<br/><br/>I feel also like often open source is like volunteering. I get paid in the good feelings I get from sharing solutions. The moment I get paid those good feelings disappear as it's just a job for hire.<br/><br/>I also make stuff open source because the market won't bare the cost and that the price people are willing to pay they ask for 10x in support and having taken their money I will feel obligated to give it to them.<br/><br/>This is my impression of much of the Unity plugin market. I could charge between $5 and $25 for my plugin because that's all the market will bare given 95% of it is high school students , college students , and starving indie devs. But, in doing so I'd be expected to provide $100-$200 in support in particular because those customers are inexperienced programmers and so don't get how to use the plugin and effectively want my to write their game.
