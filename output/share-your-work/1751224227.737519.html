I'm really happy with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/132758653">this month's FoC bonus episode</a> discussion. Jimmy and I talk about literal values in code (string, numbers, arrays, etc), looking at them as <em>affordances</em>, trying to think about the human-facing elements of their design, as distinct from (but related to) how they serve as syntax, how they get parsed, what they mean at runtime, etc. We also ruminate on literal values in various flavours of visual programming.<br/><br/>You do need to subscribe in order to hear the episode ($5/mo), but by doing so you're also supporting the time/effort it takes us to make both these bonus episodes and the <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/">main show</a>. So thank you to everyone who does support this effort, and hopefully you find this discussion invigorating.
