For example, you might search for a \"user\", but then refine that search to a \"banned user\". Note that \"banned\" and \"user\" are not _necessarily_ independent tags. Just because someone is a \"banned user\" and a \"father\" doesn't mean they're a \"banned father\" as well. The adjective \"banned\" could specifically relate to the noun \"user\".\n\nOr a slightly clearer example: someone who is both a \"skilled baker\" and a \"writer\" is not necessarily a \"skilled writer\".\n\nI'm now wondering whether an understanding of (basic) linguistics is necessary to develop a good tagging system. After all, our mission is to adapt programming languages to the human mind :thinking_face:.\n\nThis is part of my search for \"an ideal model for information\" that readers might remember from a few weeks ago.",

By this I mean an _abstract_ model (not a DRAM\/disk representation) with a vocabulary that allows a *human* to read, specify, and understand information with ease. We have existing models like RDF (\"Semantic web\") and property graphs (e.g. Neo4j), and in programming languages we have object graphs (OO languages), trees (functional languages), and tables (relational DBs). None of these models seem to have arisen as \"the one true answer\", partially because they are all difficult to reason about when operated on programmatically (or so I claim). I want a model for information that allows us to easily understand both *static* information structures (snapshots) and *programmatically-maintained* information structures (an evolving, stateful system).\n\nThe ideal model for information might define concepts like \"pointing\" (edges) or \"nesting\" (groups), and each concept will have a clear meaning. The ideal model will also have a semantics for *mutation*, e.g. you will know when you define a relationship like `A points to B` whether `B` can be deleted or modified in some way, and how this affects the `points to` connection. The model will also have a notion of *stewardship* of information, i.e. it should be easy to observe the *source* of a piece of information, and to know whether it is mutable or just a snapshot. (Yes, I believe the ideal model for information should have a vocabulary to describe distribution and trust).\n\nHas anyone here thought hard about this? I've been churning on it for a month or two recently, and for many months over the last few years; I can't proceed with my own PL project until I get fundamentals like this right, since the model that I develop will fundamentally determine what a \"program\" even is. I think a key reason why discovering \"the future of programming\" is so hard is that we think too much about code and not enough about information. *Code exists purely to transform information*, and if you don't make strides on models for information then I don't think you can make strides on programming languages.\n\nI have some ideas about a model, but I have no insights from others to validate it against. My conception is a very specific hybrid of mutable *graphs* and immutable ~trees~ *nested sets* that distinguishes between *descriptions* and *references*, and it seems very amenable to compact 2D representations, unlike most graphs. I won't describe it further just yet, since I don't want to skew anyone's responses.\n\nAnyway, I'd love to hear from other people who have been thinking about this kind of stuff.",
