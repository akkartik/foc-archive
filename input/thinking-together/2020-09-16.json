I wonder what the common characteristic for people you compress there workflow into less and less keystrokes like this is. Personally, I'd describe it as \"doesn't like doing tedious work\", but that feels wrong because that sounds like everyone. I keep coming back to some sort of ever present frustration, like using a computer when it's not customized feels like trying to force Playdough through a straw, I'd be curious if you (or others) have this same feeling and that's what drives you to customize?"
