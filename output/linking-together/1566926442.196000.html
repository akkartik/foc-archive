<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Roben Kleene</span> The very fact that you're replacing a window manager with an automation app suggests to me that you're not appreciating people's arguments here. Sure I could make stacking WMs do anything I want with a Turing-complete scripting language. That's not because of the stacking WM, it's because of the Turing-complete language.<br/><br/>Tiling WMs reduce the amount people need to mess with their WM. Adding a new way to mess with the WM doesn't address that advantage.
