<em>Brief meta note — breaking with the theme of the channel, but that's moderator's privilege :)</em><br/><br/>I want to highlight that the above links by Mariano have particularly nice formatting.<br/><br/>• Link title doubles as the URL, which is nice for archiving and (IIRC) for folks using assistive tech.<br/>• There's a clearly demarcated quote, which is nice because it gives you an appetizing taste of the article.<br/>• If Mariano wanted to add some commentary or his own brief summary, he could do that separately from the quote and it'd be easy to scan.<br/>• No need for Slack's "rich" previews (which are about as modest and meaningful as roadside billboard advertisements)
