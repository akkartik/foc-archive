<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span> I’d agree that complexity is a major issue. Tech folks, being selected for large short term memories, tend to be relatively blind to it and even seem enjoy experiencing and creating it - maybe because it highlights their talent at coping with it. I suspect another problem is the conceptual rut formed by our language. Terms like “programming” and “coding” get people thinking that creating useful artifacts has to involve steps that look like what they associate with those terms.
