Hi all! I'm Joni. I'm a designer/founder/front-end guy from Turku, Finland. Been diving deep into generative AI lately, and we built a little side project to help with our gen AI explorations: <a href="http://kollaprompt.com">kollaprompt.com</a>. Been doing design and front-end since ~2004 and it's been while since I was this excited about new tech, especially defining the new use cases, UX/UI paradigms and best practises around gen AI.<br/><br/>Aside from work I run a Cyberpunk RED TTRPG campaign and been exploring an AI assistant there to help our group with rules &amp; lore with a locally running setup (I'll post a demo when I'm happy with how it works).<br/><br/>Found this group via awesome demos from meet-ups that float in social media and looking forward to attending an event in the near future.
