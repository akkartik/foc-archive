Hi all, I am an art historian turned philosopher and historian of computing – . I was lucky enough to get a permanent research position at a time when I was starting to despair a bit and still feel as one of the most lucky persons when I realize I have this job. It gave me a new kind of freedom which I didn’t have in previous academic positions; and it took me quite a while to realize that.  I am very much engaged with retracing and rendering transparent through history where we are now with computing technology – as so many others; I worry a lot about this broad and disconnected field; I very much like an approach of asking rather basic questions (I guess that is the philosopher in me) which, at first sight, almost seem trivial but once one starts to dig a bit, seem to be quite hard. One main question I am currently focusing on is: What is a (computer) program? This is the guiding question of a research project I am coordinating and which involves historians, philosophers, computer scientists and some programmers. Note: the choice for "program" and not software; code; algorithm; etc is not arbitrary – I think it kind of comprises/implied these other notions. If anyone of you might be interested in this or anything else that is losely or strictly related to history and philosophy of computing and programs, please do share your thoughts/concerns/etc with me. Also: I am currently starting to collect answers from as many people as possible to the main question above and I would be happy to receive some from you too – best wishes, L
