Following the <a href="../present-company/1711916139.930599.html">conversation here</a> I decided to experiment with a "Month of Future of Coding Past".<br/><br/>Every week I will dump from tinyletter and re upload one month of the <a href="https://newsletter.futureofcoding.org/">Future of Coding Newsletter</a> and publish it as a message here, that way we can all go over past conversations and links and I have a reason and rhythm to make them available again.<br/><br/>A month re uploaded per week will allow me to catch up faster than "realtime" but still at a pace I can probably keep.<br/><br/>Here's the first edition, the first two newsletters I have in my email (January 2020):<br/><br/>• <a href="https://newsletter.futureofcoding.org/posts/future-of-coding-weekly-202001-week-3/">Future of Coding Weekly 2020/01 Week 3</a><br/>• <a href="https://newsletter.futureofcoding.org/posts/future-of-coding-weekly-202001-week-4/">Future of Coding Weekly 2020/01 Week 4</a>
