Hopefully this can help in keeping the flows becoming a big pile of spaghetti and better scalable. \n• Another new experiment is an import function that can import a textual program and convert it to a visual flow. In my engine I already use a small custom language which is parsed to an AST and transpile that to javascript within some node-types.. so, with this import function a script in this language can be converted to a visual flow.. it's still in its infancies , but I even want to try and convert a javascript\/typescript file to a visual flow. \n• Made some new node-types to support functions within a visual-flow. Since I don't use a port-based\/pull mechanism for the flow-runner that runs the visual program, the function parameters are send as a payload (which is a dictionary of keys and values).. and in the function node you can define the expected parameters.. currently these are not typed.\nHopefully I can find some time to make a video later this week.\nGreetings,\nMaikel",
