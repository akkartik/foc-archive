I'm struggling to find more than one or two historical examples where this is the case (Lamdu is probably the closest)

I think that “visual” usually communicates something else. Perhaps the more appropriate term is “projectional”?<br/><br/>I’ll clarify by defining some terms as I see them:<br/><br/>• Traditional text programming - freeform editing of text<br/>• Structural - Edits are done on structure. Code may still be stored as text (paredit is an example)<br/>• Visual - looks nothing like text. Data flow is visualised by the layout using nodes and arrows<br/>• Projectional - the UI displays something which isn’t an exact straightforward presentation of the code storage.<br/><br/>For example a language where the user draws an image of a diagram in Paint/Photoshop/etc and then the compiler turns the painting into a program is visual but not projectional.

I don't think "projectional" is a useful category. Text files are just projectional editors for byte arrays, so every GUI is fundamentally projectional. I also don't think "visual" should imply a lack of text, since text is inherently visual symbols. I think "visual" is only a useful term when you want to use it to distinguish between displaying data as a 1D, serialized sequence of symbols versus some other kind of visualisation where the layout is not so trivial. This implies that any "visual" language would also be a "structural" one. The tricky thing about equating the two is that for some reason, people who make structural editors oftentimes try their hardest to make everything look like a serialized sequence of symbols. IMO that only leads to an obscuration of the structure being manipulated, and for what benefit? It's a kind of Stockholm Syndrome that I've recently snapped out of.

&gt; I also don’t think “visual” should imply a lack of text, since text is inherently visual symbols.<br/><br/>Perhaps it shouldn’t imply that, but from my experience when I use this term this is what is implied.<br/><br/>&gt; Text files are just projectional editors for byte arrays<br/><br/>That’s true. But the projection is considered to be so simple to the point that it’s considered direct editing of the stored data. This is the term used by MPS and others (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ProjectionalEditing.html">https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ProjectionalEditing.html</a>) and I favor using it because it communicates important things that the term “structural” doesn’t.

&gt; Visual - looks nothing like text. Data flow is visualised by the layout using nodes and arrows<br/><br/>Most visual languages take that "nodes and noodles" approach, but there are many that don't.<br/><br/>Off the top of my [outboard] head: Apparatus, DeepUI, Dynamicland (arguably), Fizzygum, Piet, and Zells (by our own <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nikolas Martens</span>), to name a few.
