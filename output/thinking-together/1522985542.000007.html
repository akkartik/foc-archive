Having thought through what I'm about to say, it boils down to whether time is implicit or explicit in the system.  Consider.  Reactive systems generally provide a means to define transformations between categories of data so that when you wiggle one, the connected ones wobble in a corresponding way.  The system has to respond to the action of wiggling, but it doesn't necessarily model wiggling reactively.<br/><br/>Let's look at Idyll.  (It is really nice.)  Their introduction example is quite rich enough <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs">https://idyll-lang.org/docs</a>.  Variables can be numbers –– and most anything else: <tt>func</tt> will work with any function taking a number to a number.  They even have buttons to switch between <tt>Math.sin</tt> and <tt>Math.cos</tt>.  As far as I can tell, the model of time is just that of JavaScript: objects have properties, you can change them.  Idyll does the job of making sure that related properties (the internals of the chart) get updated when you switch the <tt>func</tt>.  It's lovely.<br/><br/>Are there an alternatives to relying on an imperative substrate?  Several.  In Eve, rules can create persistent bindings like Idyll, but rules can also commit something to the future, "When the 'cos' button is clicked, make it so that in <tt>func = Math.cos</tt> afterwards."  In principle, you can ask, "Why is <tt>func == Math.cos</tt>?"  And the system can answer, "it's because someone clicked the 'cos' button a few seconds ago."  You can even ask, "why isn't it <tt>Math.sin</tt> anymore?"  One answer is to look at all the things that influenced <tt>func</tt> between now and the last time its value was <tt>Math.sin</tt>.  Reactive synchronization across time.
