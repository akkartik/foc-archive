        "text": "Hi <@UCKRZS3DZ> I had a partial response to your question directed at me in the other thread. I'll finish and post it here, as Ivan has made multiple requests in that thread to not take it off topic. What you asked:\n&gt; Given:\n&gt; Discussing politics is allowed by CoC\n&gt; Various members reason in left-wing terms, thinking that it is the only way\n&gt; Objecting to reasoning in left-wing terms(group identity) is not welcome\n&gt; Arguing that left-wing reasoning is not the only way is not welcome either\n&gt; \n&gt; Computes to:\n&gt; \n&gt; Gradual removal of all members of community that don't align politically with left-wing ideas in the long term.\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I wrong in my reasoning?\nYes I think that reasoning is wrong. I certainly don't want people who identify as right-wing to feel excluded here. I'll make some points:\n1. Thinking is multi-dimensional and its not always easy to reduce it to a single dimension (left\/right). Rather we can look at different stances\/aspects independently. In this case it is diversity but consider economic models (capitalism vs...?) or organization models (centralized vs distributed vs ...) and I think you'll find different sets of people align with different ideas. I certainly don't like to be being reduced to \"left-wing thinking\" and I'm not sure it even means the same thing in all countries. Just like programming is multi-dimensional and we shouldn't reduce it something trivial like 'static vs dynamic typing'.\n2. Imagine I said \"I'm interested in doing A\" and person X said \"that's not interesting, a waste of time and it's not going to work\". OK, maybe not a great way to put it, but X can disagree, it's fine. I can still work on my initiative. Now imagine person Y goes \"that's not worthwhile and I've already taken some concrete steps to foil your work on A\". Now that's going a bit too far. That's the challenge when you consider initiative A = diversity. _We're working with people, not computers, and just saying things (such as stereotyping all members of a group that you are not part of) will put off people and foil our plans on this initiative_. Which is why it's important to be sensitive in this discussion, specially when it appears that you are not being _personally_ disadvantaged by this specific initiative.\n3. Lets imagine for a moment what you're saying happens: that people who identify as 'left wing' (L) hang around while those that identify as 'right wing' (R) leave in the long term. Does this mean that R are less interested in FoC than L? Certainly looking at this slack someone could say so! What if some L folk then infer that R folk are \"just not interested\" in this topic? Would they be correct in their \"evidence based\" inference? I guess what I'm trying to get as is this: if you feel excluded because of the Code of Conduct's position on _one issue_ which you associate with being against right-wing, consider what would happen if someone (who does not identify as R) makes a broad statement that \"Rs are just not interested in FoC\" and then provides the evidence above? Indeed, I believe such a statement would be against the Code of Conduct as well! (I also wonder if you see the irony in saying \"left wing\" and \"group identity\" in the same sentence)\nI hope that helps clear things up a bit.",

The easiest way for me to make the case is to include a bit more context from the original message, which I deleted as a Code of Conduct violation:\n\n&gt; There is nothing morally wrong about having 100% male community. Men and women statistically tend to have different interests [1]. Men are more interested in things, women are more interested in people. That might be the reason why this community is predominantly male. Nothing wrong about it.\n&gt; Although having more female members would be great.\n&gt; [1] <https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19883140>\nFirst, there is something wrong with the fact that the community is 100% male, and this is something that multiple people had previously tried to explain to Vladimir again and again <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/CEXED56UR\/p1581999680035700|in this thread>. That is: we've heard many times from both women and men that they don't want to participate because the community is 100% male and has resulting problems. (It's not worth burning the calories to argue whether this issue is about morality or not, so I'm ignoring that additional layer of categorization, since it never appeared in any of the other arguments and seems like a distinction without a difference.) The very podcast episode and survey results that spawned this discussion even included _multiple_ examples of people telling us that they don't feel like participating for this reason (though, sadly, I had to omit a very compelling one of them because the author asked that it be kept private.)\n\nVladimir ignored all of this, and chose instead to attribute the cause of the absence of women from the community to psychological sex differences. The implication being: women would not be interested in this community because they aren't interested in \"things\" like programming tools.\n\nIt's sexist to characterize women in this way. It perpetuates a stereotype. It sends a signal to any women reading that they aren't expected to be interested in programming, not in the same way that men are. It narrows the scope of reasons that women may be interested in participating down to a binary. It's also the sort of unfounded characterization that women have been ceaselessly subjected to in tech (not to mention elsewhere), that countless women have come forward and asked for people to stop making. So in that way, it's also disrespectful.\n\nThat's why I deleted it. It's exactly the sort of statement that would keep women from feeling welcome here, and we serve to gain nothing from considering that line of reasoning since it had already been resoundingly disproven, so there's tremendous downside and no upside to allowing that message to remain.",

The implication being: women would not be interested in this community because they aren't interested in \"things\" like programming tools.\n\nIt's sexist to characterize women in this way. It perpetuates a stereotype. It sends a signal to any women reading that they aren't expected to be interested in programming, not in the same way that men are. It narrows the scope of reasons that women may be interested in participating down to a binary. It's also the sort of unfounded characterization that women have been ceaselessly subjected to in tech (not to mention elsewhere), that countless women have come forward and asked for people to stop making. So in that way, it's also disrespectful.\n\nThat's why I deleted it. It's exactly the sort of statement that would keep women from feeling welcome here, and we serve to gain nothing from considering that line of reasoning since it had already been resoundingly disproven, so there's tremendous downside and no upside to allowing that message to remain."
