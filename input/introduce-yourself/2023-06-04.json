I was introduced to the Future of Coding community through <@U0275EZH3UN>’s amazing essays while browsing the Internet and reading about _digital gardens_ on Twitter. I was so excited to finally put words to something I enjoyed working with for a long time since I was in tech! Absolutely love the FoC podcast and the takes on various papers. I have previously <https:\/\/mohitkarekar.com\/posts\/2021\/unipipe-executor\/|tinkered with visual programming> and I go back to the project frequently to add features or draw some learnings from it.\nMy work is majorly in JS\/TS and I work in a web platform team; I have always enjoyed working on meta products that let other people build on top of them (and hence my interest in language tools and this community). I also am inclined to use such models to make programming more accessible (esp. in remote parts of my home country (India)) and I like reading any research on these lines. In fact, the podcast has made me more interested in <https:\/\/aboutcomputingsystems.substack.com\/p\/about-computing-systems-a-newsletter|reading research> and knowing more about computing history, and through it how it will look in the future.\nLooking forward to engaging with the community and attending any events that happen in\/around Berlin. Would love to meet some of you!",
