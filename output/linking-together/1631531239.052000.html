Hi folks, I am new to this community but I wanted to share an interview that Ted Kaehler (who worked on both Smalltalk and HyperCard) was kind enough to do with me. I asked him about the two systems and how they relate to users being able to inspect and modify their own software.<br/><br/>Some of his insights that interested me most were about the impact of the HyperCard Help Stack on HyperCard’s design itself, the places he says that Bill Atkinson was right in his different approach from Smalltalk, and how a user builds a drag and drop UI and then says “I’m almost done.”<br/><br/><a href="https://codingitwrong.github.io/empowering/ted.html">https://codingitwrong.github.io/empowering/ted.html</a>

&gt; Alan Kay wanted to build a “personal computer for all ages.” Just as writing and music are each a kind of “literacy”, so the ability to build simulations and play with them would be a new literacy. Simulations help a student understand anything that changes over time. The spread of an epidemic or the growth of a forest fire are great examples. Every child should become empowered to do simulations.<br/>:heart: :heart: This helps with a long-standing question of mine: <a href="../share-your-work/1613351462.087400.html">../share-your-work/1613351462.087400.html</a>

&gt; Each version of Smalltalk was created as a simulation in an earlier version Smalltalk. It was particularly easy to make a new functioning class heirarchy along side the existing one. Smalltalk-76 was quite a bit different from ST-74, and it was vital to build one inside of ST-74. New data formats for objects were easy to simulate. Dan Ingalls got as far as running a simulated version of the compiler for ST-76 to verify that it would work once we “crossed the bridge” to the new system.<br/>:exploding_head:
