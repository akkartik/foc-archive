I've been doing more and more writing lately, and have been wishing for a tool that allows me to write my outlines, drafts, and final compositions in the same editor window with the ability to toggle any of those "layers" on and off at will, merge them, copy selections to new layers, etc. It would work sort of like Photoshop but for writing... I have a feeling these principles could also work as an IDE extension (imagine being able to hide the "code" layer and show only the "comments" layer, or the "documentation" layer). Curious to hear your thoughts, or whether anyone else is working on something similar?

This is a fascinating idea and I've never seen anything like it. I love the approach of taking something we take for granted in the GUI tools world and folding it back into the textual tools world. There's an open-endedness to this that is exciting to me the way Roam was exciting when I first saw it. I hope you keep exploring this space and share what you learn about it.

Yeah this is rad. :slightly_smiling_face: I designed and built a prototype of what you’re describing back when I was on Visual Studio - I even called it editor layers. Lots of our designs have trickled out over the last decade, but sadly that one hasn’t yet. We did all sorts of cool stuff with it, turned types on and off, reduced things to signatures, embedded profiling information in, unit testing coverage/passing, git blame-like stuff, callers/references, even real-time inline diffing, all toggled by this little series of buttons attached to the top right of the screen. The design came from thinking of the editor a bit like an overhead projector and you just kept putting transparencies over top whatever was there - different sets gave you very different views on the thing you were looking at. That same idea eventually was the source for the name “Light Table.”<br/><br/>Years later I was surprised to see Gary Berhardt basically produce the same design, with many of the same examples! :slightly_smiling_face: <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world</a>

We did something similar in the Eve editor as well where you could control the sections of the document that were visible at any point in time, though that’s a little less layer-y and a bit more “build the document out of the pieces that are relevant.” We did also have a performance layer, but we never exposed the panel to turn it on.

The thing I get from this, that I didn't get from A(n) Whole New World (for instance) is that these Rabl layers can be nothing more than a named text style with a visibility toggle. In the video, the style is just a color. The style could be a little fancier — maybe different fonts, why not. But the process of defining a new layer ought to be just like photoshop: add a layer on the fly, name it (or not), put stuff in it. The barrier being so low, you don't even acknowledge how powerful it is.<br/><br/>Sure, we could start imagining all the built-in layers a code editor could add, and that's cool... but that's a different thing than a tool just for a writer to define their own conventions around. Like the difference between adjustment layers (PS) or nondestructive filter layers (Pixelmator Pro) and regular layers (every nontrivial image, video, music, etc editor).<br/><br/>I want both, but they're separate ideas.

Great Idea! I also like that the user only creates a layer and start to add text to it, without any meaning other than the one she decides according to her workflow.

In Glamorous Toolkit, we utilized both ideas. Here is an example that covers both dimensions:<br/>• we only show a markup when the cursor goes nearby (so, toggling is implied by the user action), and <br/>• we insert arbitrary previews (not only text) live. These can be added by the syntax highlighting.<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/girba/status/1298872921839079424">https://twitter.com/girba/status/1298872921839079424</a>

Oh hell yes, give it to me now. My current workflow for writing fiction sort of emulates this in plain text: I often put an outline thingy (list of beats, anyway) at the start of a scene and delete them later. I also tend to mark things for future deletion with square brackets if I'm not sure yet whether I want to (or to give me time to cope with killing a favorite line). I would love to instead shunt them to a different layer. I crave layers every day, and so I've thought a lot about them, for outlining as in your demo, for coding as in Bernhardt's talk, and for data representation like <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nick Smith</span>  and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Orion Reed</span> have been talking about, e.g. if you're extracting and transforming data from a word doc, using layers as a way to separate info that is portable between formats and Word-proprietary details that just need to stay around if we want to round-trip processed data into the original format.<br/><br/>So yes, I've been working on it in the sense of thinking and wishing really hard. Still working out the details.

This looks very nice! I use org-mode in Emacs in much the same way, but it's a lot more cumbersome to use because org-mode, like all outline/folding editors, supposes a hierarchy of detail which isn't always there. That's also true of the markup display technique in GToolkit that <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tudor Girba</span> just mentioned. That's a very nice implementation of detail-hiding, but not the same as unrelated layers.

I simply said that the mechanism can be used in many ways in the two classes mentioned In the thread: either to hide/I hide or to augment with external content. The example exercises both. Indeed for a different use case than the initial one.

I already experimented with this idea for markup and inline graphics plugins in my text editor.  It's my hope that I can build a 'markdown wiki' hosted entirely in the editor, and single click deployed to github.  One day I can use it to write documentation or update my website.  I'm surprised more editors don't automatically format and let you edit markdown tags live inside documents; it feels like a natural extension that should have been done a while ago.  The layers in the demo are more like 'folds', yes?  i.e. the layers aren't independent of the text paragraphs on other layers - they are stacked with them?  It's powerful stuff.  I can imagine writing emails this way; but maybe that could result in embarrassing mistakes!!

I am so excited by this idea of layers for arbitrary author-determined organization, I'm going to just rattle out some ways I can imagine it being used. All of these are written from a writer's perspective:<br/><br/>• I'm not sure whether I want to say "John while Henry had had had had had..." or "Sarah while Kim had had had..." here, so I'll put the latter on a different layer here so I can come back and switch it later if I change my mind.<br/>• I'm going to put all copy-pasted quotes on a different layer, and URLs to sources on their own layer too, so I can be sure to catch them all when I do biblio at the end.<br/>• I want to write a parenthetical in this parenthetical, but that's going to be awful for readability. I'll throw it on a new layer, so I can catch it when I come back for rewrites.<br/>• I hate this sentence. I don't think it needs to be here. Let me hide it and live with that for a while.<br/>• I think I might be using too many adverbs. Let me make an adverbs layer, and I'll pull things onto that as I re-read, and then see how bad it actually is.<br/>• And.. new layer for "tweetables", and a separate one for "pull quotes"...

Yup I'm now thinking about how to add it to my editor. This opens up a whole new dimension. Kinda like transclusion, but simpler, because the content isn't "somewhere else, transcluded here" but rather "in another layer, but right here". There is an implicit, global organization (the flattened document), but then you can expand the flatness into the different dimensions as needed.

I've been kicking around an idea for a while in the same vein, but coming from the direction of reading instead of writing. I like to take different kinds of notes--structural, commentary, cross-reference (within a work/to other works), summary, etc. I've been thinking about building something around an e-book reader that would allow me to move between and freely intersperse different forms of notes.<br/><br/>So, I could start with a view of my structural notes (my "map" of the book; possibly involving visualizations) and quickly drill down to the right section for deeper reading. Then I could add a cross reference by searching through my corpus for the right information, then pull it up side-by-side and add shared commentary--which can then serve as a new work that I can then structure, commentate, cross-reference, and so on.<br/><br/>It's a view of writing (or note-taking) that emphasizes the connection between the stimulus (the original work) and the response (the layers of annotation), always keeping them linked. So, theoretically, if I published a blog post and a reader owned a book I reference in the post, they'd be able to move directly from a reference in the post to the relevant passage in the book, then be able to surf my layers of annotation (and add their own) if they so desire.<br/><br/>Haven't gotten around to doing anything yet, though.

Like <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Christopher Galtenberg</span> mentioned, it would be so crazy to incorporate some element of progressive summarization (or spaced repetition!), so I'll definitely be exploring that as I start building this out.

Curious to hear people's thoughts about how different this is from using nesting content. Seems very similar to me except that children are inlined when visible. When nesting, for example:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">- 1<br/>  - 2<br/>    - 3<br/><br/>- 1<br/>  - 2<br/>    - 3<br/>      - 4</pre><br/>the user would need a shortcut or UI to choose a global depth <em>(level)</em> which would open all nodes until a certain depth (1,2 or 3, 4).<br/>I think either approach (flat &amp; nested) possible in roam today by using tags &amp; filters. So the user would have to tag a block like <tt>#ideas</tt> and the apply the appropriate filter.

You could implement one in terms of the other, as long as you allowed arbitrary showing/hiding, rather than needing to open nested levels strictly in order. Beyond that, the difference is entirely in the UI. Nesting mixes content and presentation, layers (as imagined in this thread) don't. What seems nice about nesting is that it's easy to move things between layers — just indent/outdent to the level you want.

The way I understood it, this sort of layering is very different from hierarchical nesting. The individually showable/hideable segments in an org-mode style outline are confined to mutually exclusive regions (wrt their "level"), whereas layers can freely intermingle through the full extent of the document. To recover layers from an outline, you would need to not only have an operation that hides/shows everything at, say, level 2 <b>without</b> changing the parent's visibility, but you would need to have other "levels" under level 1 that actually sort of compare the same as 2, in the sense that they are always siblings, but distinct for the purposes of the global show/hide command. I'm not sure that would be enough, actually. Once you add the idea of arbitrary visibility, it's hard for me to think of it as hierarchical at all.<br/><br/>Looked at another way, nesting induces a total order on the "layers" that may not be desirable.<br/><br/>So, I would argue layers are more general than nesting. Nesting is easily implemented in terms of layers (one per node), but nesting is not enough to implement layering without at least using weird hacks.

My mind keeps going back to this idea of layered text and everything you could do with it. What about true overlapping layers? Would it make sense? E.g one layer may have a text snippet and another layer may have a link that overlaps exactly with that snippet. It can subsume all embedded markup. You just dump all style info into the style layer, exactly overlapping with the parts you're styling.

It would be cool to have OS support, but I worry about pipe-based composability. I think that's essential to being a Unix "lingua franca". To process a piece of layered text, you have to know what layers exist and what they mean. Most of them are probably very application-specific, even stream-specific. You could generically pass them through, but then an entire ecosystem of utilities has to deal with format complexity they can't benefit from and can only mess up. At that point it's probably better to build a full object system like Powershell, since you're already paying for most of it.

Pipes could still be flat text (you'd select or flatten the layers when you pipe), but what I was getting at was how the 'medium' affects what we design. We design PLs with a 'flat' grammar because we are designing languages represented in flat text. Layered text is still very free form and Unix like, but would lead to different kinds of PLs that make use of the layers.

I'm trying to get the implementation of this clear in my head, since I'm seriously considering adding it to my text editor to help with other issues.  One thing I've been thinking about is annotating shaders with widget information.  For example, what if my flattened code looked like this:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">/* Layer:1 Widget:Slider, Min:0, Max:10 */ float val;</pre><br/>Effectively showing layer 1 would enable editing of how the float value widget would work.  Hiding layer 1 just gives you the shader code with the widget popup.<br/>As I understand it layers aren't nested, but I think you'd need to be able to 'expand' deeper layers into upper layers without opening intermediate layers.  For example:<br/>L0:-----------|---<br/>L1: ------|-------<br/>L2 ----|----------<br/>The | represents the location in Layer1 of layer2.  Expanding layer 1 would show layer 2, and inside layer 2 there is another point where a further layer lives.  But if L2 is shown but L1 is not, then L2 would effectively appear where the | is on layer 0.  I think?<br/>And of course, edits to the L0 layer would wind up 'moving' the insertion point of Layer1.  But what about deleting the region around the expand point?  I guess the next layer just drops into the nearest sensible position.....<br/>I do something similar with Markers in my code, which can be used for things like compile errors.  Which brings up the next issue of compiling code and referring back to locations in the source that may not be expanded, etc. :wink:<br/>So in short, interesting issues that might lead to a powerful system......

Implementation note: with layers that contain extra information comes the possibility that a flattened file could not be just dropped into a game engine without sanitizing.  So for this case, comments in layers makes sense because it keeps the code compiling and keeps it as a plain text file.  But it's just a convention.

And collapsing Layer1 from my code sample above could have a special display; I was thinking some kind of mark in the code to indicate points where layers are embedded; but suppose the widget was a color picker.... then the collapsed layer 1 would be a color swatch.  Nice....<br/>And not forgetting that layer 1 is effectively several fragments, since there can be multiple point in the text where layer 1 pieces are inserted.  Hmm, this might keep me going for a week or 2!<br/>OK, I'll stop designing out loud......:)

The concept here of standoff annotations is similar to what I've been improving in Zep, with its 'RangeMarkers' as I call them.  Originally these were for annotating source code with compile errors:

The range marker is locked to the text so that edits above/below and undo/redo will keep it consistently in the same place.  This one has an associated mark in the number column, and a tooltip.  But I have several different kinds of range marker, including simple underlines, bounding boxes around text, etc.

My markers can also introduce widgets into the text, such as this color swatch; in which case the text flows around them and they are effectively invisible to edit operations on the text.

There are 2 paths forward from this point:<br/>• Have shader-specific parsers automatically inject markers at the right point (like compile errors, or color pickers on color variables)<br/>• Add additional annotation information to the marker other than the tooltip.

The second part is where things get interesting, and where the layer system would help a lot.  For example, if the compile error was on a layer, I could choose to show the error layer, effectively embedding all compile errors inside the text.<br/>My first priority is to get easy edit widgets like the color picker to work well, but I'm spending some brain power at the moment trying to figure out how to get a layer system that works well into the editor....

I was implementing this and got stuck part way with copy paste. What should happen with cut/copy/paste? Say you hide a few layers, then cut a visible chunk that surrounds some hidden text and paste it elsewhere. Does the hidden text:<br/>1. Vanish<br/>2. Travel with the cut/pasted text<br/>3. Move to the end of the original cut location<br/>Note that you may cut but never paste the text. Or you may copy/paste.

I think that you should always favour preservation; so my intention here is to have it move to the end.  But I'm not certain, for sure.  Travelling might make sense too; but perhaps a that becomes a 'deep copy' operation with associated key stroke, etc.

Yeah I'm thinking if something is hidden (like a hidden photoshop layer) you shouldn't be able to affect it - neither copy nor cut. So it would just drop to the end of the original cut location. Side note: traveling with the cut is also harder to implement for me because the clipboard needs to be modified to hold the hidden text. Finally if you cut, but never paste, you don't want to lose what you didn't see when cutting.

OTOH, if you 'show' a layer and cut/paste, you want the layers to be preserved, not flattened, so we probably need to modify the clipboard to hold layered text anyway..

Agreed; I was thinking about having a secondary buffer containing the layer for each character and storing/retrieving that with the text itself.  I have quite a narrow undo/redo layer; essentially there are only 2 commands that can modify text - Insert/Delete.  In these commands I already store the location of adornments/markers so that they can be replaced after a paste.  So that isn't hard; but it is hard to know what to do in each circumstance.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Shalabh</span> you make a good point about the principles involved in implementing this (that if a particular layer is hidden, actions which operate on other layers shouldn't be able to affect it): my intuition was almost the complete opposite in the sense that clipboard operations would need to operate on all the layers at once, regardless of their visibility (which was part of the reason I opted to explore the "always show invisibles" route rather than attempting to implement some sort of position-preserving operations or other magic). I suppose this is a consequence of the serial nature of text, its an inherently linear medium...

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Rabl</span> Yes I can see if I have one hidden sentence in the 'draft' layer, it clearly belongs in the surrounding context and should travel with it. In fact most layer use cases might be like this. I've implemented layers by 'collapsing' instead of hiding - the layer collapses into a single character. Maybe this sets the expectation wrt moving and deletion?

Interesting <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Shalabh</span> - I had been intending to do the same thing; collapse to an 'indicator' for the hidden layer points, but it didn't occur to me that this helps the problem of working on hidden layers because you can see what you are copying, etc. I wonder if that is more of an argument for destroying layer content if it is visibly present and collapsed.   Perhaps the 'transport' or 'delete' option could be a user option.  And perhaps deleting hidden layer content could move that content onto a special 'deleted' layer....

To counter what I was saying earlier (hidden layers should not be affected), one observation is that there is no absolute coordinate system in layered text. In 2d graphics, each layer is independently grounded to a stable absolute coordinate system. All movement is relative to the absolute coordinate system. (Is this true? I haven't used 2d drawing that much)<br/><br/>In text all we have are relative coordinates. So when moving text chunks, we're not just moving the content, we're also possibly moving the coordinate system - the ground itself is moving. In other words, the principle 'hidden layers should not be affected' seems to be on shaky ground.

I have a feeling that part of the difficulty is in porting a layer-oblivious concept of "selection" to a layered context. Selections have to know what layers they contain and maybe which they skip, and make it clear to the user. If you're writing a long text, different use cases will call for including the outline layer or just the "final text" layer in a copy-paste.<br/><br/>Idea 1: only show placeholders for layers when they are in or next to a selection/the cursor. Idea 2: part of the UI display of a selection is a layer-selector similar to the one for the whole document, so you can choose to exclude layers within the range defined by the selection (at which point it starts acting like a multi-selection.)

Text is a linear sequence of characters and selections are just ranges in that linear sequence. Introducing different layers means at least introducing some form of hierarchy that breaks all the simple algorithms that work well with ranges in sequences.<br/><br/>Cutting a range out of a linear sequence only makes sense if the sequence is the ultimate truth — but then you can’t model different layers with it. Adding layers means you fundamentally change the core data model from something as simple as a sequence to something more complex like a tree or worse.<br/><br/>But that’s a great direction to think in. We need to figure that out for structural editing too.

I don't see any potential for recursive hierarchy in the mockup that kicked off this thread. I think there have been a couple conflicting models discussed here, but that one is pretty flat AFAICT. I think it's basically a sequence of (layer_tag, text).<br/><br/>As long as all the layers need to be contiguous but non-overlapping, i.e. perfectly cover the range [0,n), then the linear sequence with layer metadata is an equally valid ultimate truth (in a certain sense anyway?) to a sequence of layer segments. I don't necessarily want to get bogged down in the representation of a selection, but I think an index range is not crazy. Algorithms on pointers into this structure are going to be tricky regardless.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andrew F</span> I was thinking about cut &amp; paste with overlapping ranges (which I interpreted as something we talked about above), considering the selection to be one of the ranges. My comment was meant conceptually, not talking about implementation. There are many different ways to implement it, and it doesn't have to end up in an actual tree data structure, but conceptually it seems to me that there is a line that's crossed when you need to deal with overlapping ranges where you cross over into a different complexity class.<br/><br/>If I'd be better at math, I'd probably be able to explain that better with algebraic structures and the operations defined on them. I think it has to do with the total order requirement on the character sequence, which makes ranges work, but then as soon as you start handling ranges as their own entities with their own operations defined on them, you are introducing another… hmm… <em>layer</em> that has different requirements. And that's what I mean by hierarchy — layers are <em>above</em> the sequence conceptually and allow certain operations, doesn't matter how you implement them.<br/><br/>Ah, well, that probably doesn't help, sorry. I wish I could explain it better. Right now it just <em>feels</em> to me that there are some use cases, like cut &amp; paste of arbitrary ranges which don't correspond exactly to layer range boundaries, that can't be represented unambiguously with a pure linear sequence + a set of ranges into that sequence. It could probably be worked around though with some heuristics that'll translate the edge cases into weird/unintuitive behavior from the user's perspective, and perhaps that's totally acceptable.<br/><br/>But I'd love to be proven wrong and maybe there's a better way! This would solve one of my current problems too…

The simplest way I'm thinking about this conceptually is that each character has attached metadata - the layer name. It travels with the character where ever it goes. So editing as usual just moves the characters around. Contiguous is more of an incidental feature - many consecutive characters have the same layer. As an optimization, you can only store entire spans as Andrew suggested above. The only new features, which are outside of editing the text, are 'attach layer to character (or span.. as optimization)' and 'show/hide layer'.

(Based on the comments I got) That essay is often taken literally, but it was meant more of an appetizer to start looking at how the design of a medium affects all things built upon it. Layered text would also be a legit proposition in those terms. BTW layering seems richer/more flexible than nesting for some reason - can't put my finger on it yet.

Fair enough! <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Shalabh</span>  <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Christopher Galtenberg</span> <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Maughan</span> I’m curious whether adding automatic line numbering and a column limit on the number of characters in a line might help to solve the “coordinate system” problem: think BASIC crossed with the Photoshop ruler tools... I say BASIC because a common convention when writing programs was to number lines in multiples of 10 so that if you needed to add a line between two existing lines (say between 30 and 40), you could add line 31 without messing up any of your GOTOs. Only difference here is that the line numbers wouldn’t be semantically meaningful to the user, so I could hide them.
