        "text": "Is there any hope for end-user programming when programmers themselves don't use programming to solve their own problems?\n\nFor a long time, I've been asking myself the question about why more programmers don't use programming to solve their own problems, but it just occurred to me the implications of that to end-user programming. Does end-user programming ever have a chance of succeeding for non-programmers to solve their problems if programmers themselves aren't using programming to solve their problems?\n\nWhen I say programmers don't solve their own problems with programming, what I mean is, there is sort of a ladder of useful techniques to use programming to make programming itself easier. It starts with customizing your shell or your text editor by cut-and-pasting code snippets you find online, and progresses to writing your own customizations from scratch, to writing your own shell\/text editor extensions, and finally to writing your own full programs to solve your own problems.\n\nI find it so odd that it's so rare for any of the programmers I know personally to progress beyond the first stage (some light shell\/text editor customization by cut-and-pasting some code they found online). Since programmers are experts at programming, and they generally choose not to use solve their own problems with programming, what hope is there for end-users to use programming to solve their problems? Or is there something wrong with the lens I'm looking through here? Perhaps programmers are using programming to solve their own problems in a way I'm not seeing? (I.e., that aren't shell and text editor scripting)?",

Does end-user programming ever have a chance of succeeding for non-programmers to solve their problems if programmers themselves aren't using programming to solve their problems?\n\nWhen I say programmers don't solve their own problems with programming, what I mean is, there is sort of a ladder of useful techniques to use programming to make programming itself easier. It starts with customizing your shell or your text editor by cut-and-pasting code snippets you find online, and progresses to writing your own customizations from scratch, to writing your own shell\/text editor extensions, and finally to writing your own full programs to solve your own problems.\n\nI find it so odd that it's so rare for any of the programmers I know personally to progress beyond the first stage (some light shell\/text editor customization by cut-and-pasting some code they found online). Since programmers are experts at programming, and they generally choose not to use solve their own problems with programming, what hope is there for end-users to use programming to solve their problems? Or is there something wrong with the lens I'm looking through here? Perhaps programmers are using programming to solve their own problems in a way I'm not seeing? (I.e., that aren't shell and text editor scripting)?"

I think there’s optimism here if you look at other areas entirely where the experience &amp; tooling is very different for an end-user vs a professional.\n\nCooking is the best example I keep coming back. Home chefs \/ ’amateur’s use scaled down pots &amp; pans. Industrial kitchens are more like factories and use giant equipment that an ‘end-user’ would never really consider buying. But both of these are 100% valid industries and crafts. There’s more content targeting end-user home-chefs than there is for elite chefs. In theory, restaurants could provide 99% of the meals that all humans need but cost, cultural traditions, etc are still big barriers.\n\nThis has preserved home-cooking for literally centuries! If restaurants \/ central kitchens could provide all meals at the same cost as you making it, I predict we’d see a huge dip in home-cooking. Most people don’t make their own furniture anymore but pretty much everyone still cooks to some degree (even if you’re just microwaving food). Necessity is really the driver \/ mother of invention here. Home-cooking is still the best hammer for most people’s food problems",

I think there’s optimism here if you look at other areas entirely where the experience & tooling is very different for an end-user vs a professional.\n\nCooking is the best example I keep coming back. Home chefs \/ ’amateur’s use scaled down pots & pans. Industrial kitchens are more like factories and use giant equipment that an ‘end-user’ would never really consider buying. But both of these are 100% valid industries and crafts. There’s more content targeting end-user home-chefs than there is for elite chefs. In theory, restaurants could provide 99% of the meals that all humans need but cost, cultural traditions, etc are still big barriers.\n\nThis has preserved home-cooking for literally centuries! If restaurants \/ central kitchens could provide all meals at the same cost as you making it, I predict we’d see a huge dip in home-cooking. Most people don’t make their own furniture anymore but pretty much everyone still cooks to some degree (even if you’re just microwaving food). Necessity is really the driver \/ mother of invention here. Home-cooking is still the best hammer for most people’s food problems"
