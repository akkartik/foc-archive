        "text": "&gt; I have this feeling that I can design it in a way that doesn't need a vector clock for causal consistency\nA way to have causal consistency in an append only log, is to use a combination of a Lamport timestamp and an unique session ID, i.e. an ID unique to each site of editing. You order events based on the timestamp and when two events from two sites have the same timestamp you use the ID to choose the order in a deterministic way. It is actually what I have successfully used for my implementation of CausalTree\/CRDT. You can find more information about this here: <http:\/\/archagon.net\/blog\/2018\/03\/24\/data-laced-with-history\/>. It is a very well written article and actually it is after reading it that I work on my Rust implementation of this. Here is en excerpt, explaining the ordering of the event log:\n&gt; \"This won’t be convergent by default since the operations don’t have an inherent total order, but it’s easy to fix this by giving each one a globally-unique ID in the form of an owner UUID\n&gt;  \n&gt; plus a Lamport timestamp. (In the diagrams below, this is encoded as “SX@TY”, where “SX” represents the UUID for site X, and Y is just the timestamp.) With this scheme, no two operations can have the same ID: operations from the same owner will have different timestamps, while operations from different owners will have different UUIDs. The Lamport timestamps will be used to sort the operations into causal order, leaving the UUIDs for tiebreaking when concurrent operations happen to have the same timestamp.\" ",

With this scheme, no two operations can have the same ID: operations from the same owner will have different timestamps, while operations from different owners will have different UUIDs. The Lamport timestamps will be used to sort the operations into causal order, leaving the UUIDs for tiebreaking when concurrent operations happen to have the same timestamp.\" "

Particularly for the following passage:\n\n&gt; I learned in high school that the craft of writing consists mainly of rewriting, and that rewriting consists mainly of rearrangement. Once you’ve written something it’s in the wrong order. Then you cut it apart and arrange the pieces of paper in the right order. This can take some time and you may have pieces of paper lying around your desk or your bedroom floor. For hundreds of years, this process was called “cut and paste.”\n&gt; \n&gt; Did PARC give us a good way to cut and paste? NO! PARC gave us an abominable editing mechanism propagandistically hidden behind the former term. The abominable mechanism is a hidey hole you can put something into, and it’s called “the clipboard”. And hiding something in the clipboard has since 1984 been called “cut”. Then you choose where this one piece goes and blurp it out. And this blurp-out action has since 1984 been called “paste”.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not only did PARC take away the fundamental method of reorganization, and give us a hidey hole instead, but they gave that hidey hole the name of the previous method. Which in true Orwellian style has made people forget. And the Macintosh laid it on us in 1984, the Orwellian year.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, this twisting of the previous terminology for an entirely different function was perpetrated by… Larry Tesler, who is one of the nicest guys I know. As the Christians say, hate the sin but love the sinner. I’ve been corresponding with Larry, no time to read his beautiful reply until now. He thinks, old fashioned cut and paste is a complex method for professionals and researchers. And ordinary people don’t need anything better.

He later went to Apple to work on the Macintosh.\n\nIn TextEdit on the Macintosh, I can select some text, then drag &amp; drop the selected text to another location. It seems like this is the kind of UI that Nelson is advocating. But I generally don't use this feature, because it becomes awkward if the text has to travel a long distance, especially if I have to scroll a long distance in the document to find the destination for the text I am moving.\n\nPARC-style cut copy &amp; paste is simple, easy and works. People have implemented \"better\" systems but they always more complicated, and fail to catch on. Can you provide a link where Nelson demonstrates a better UI?",

He later went to Apple to work on the Macintosh.\n\nIn TextEdit on the Macintosh, I can select some text, then drag & drop the selected text to another location. It seems like this is the kind of UI that Nelson is advocating. But I generally don't use this feature, because it becomes awkward if the text has to travel a long distance, especially if I have to scroll a long distance in the document to find the destination for the text I am moving.\n\nPARC-style cut copy & paste is simple, easy and works. People have implemented \"better\" systems but they always more complicated, and fail to catch on. Can you provide a link where Nelson demonstrates a better UI?"

Ted's asking for the OS to provide a framework for parts of documents that can be given mutable but persistent locations, akin to a desktop or bedroom floor. They can be moved around, they stay in one place unless moved around, and you can see where they moved from.\nI get to enjoy this exact mode of working when I edit video and audio. For instance, here (below) is a screenshot from the Orca podcast episode. At the bottom, in the clip editor, you see the full source audio recording. In the middle of the screen, in the main \"arrangement\" view, you see all the ways I've cut up and rearranged that source audio into the final product, stripping out some pauses where they felt bad, adding in pauses where they felt good, cutting out a tremendous amount of stuttering and false starts and tangents.\n\nWhen I'm editing thousand-line source files, or documentation, or blog posts, I often use copy-and-paste in a similar (but less richly supported) way — I keep a scratchpad document open next to my main document, and whenever I cut something but don't know where it's going, I paste it to the scratchpad. Nothing ever stays in the hidey hole, because that's a recipe for lost work. But I often find myself in the situation where I rearrange the document, leave it for a week, come back with fresh eyes.. and realize the flow of thoughts is worse than it was before. I suspect that what Ted is asking for would help with this, by allowing me to \"view things as they were\" with a little more interactivity than just undo\/redo or version history.",

                                "text": "\nI get to enjoy this exact mode of working when I edit video and audio. For instance, here (below) is a screenshot from the Orca podcast episode. At the bottom, in the clip editor, you see the full source audio recording. In the middle of the screen, in the main \"arrangement\" view, you see all the ways I've cut up and rearranged that source audio into the final product, stripping out some pauses where they felt bad, adding in pauses where they felt good, cutting out a tremendous amount of stuttering and false starts and tangents.\n\nWhen I'm editing thousand-line source files, or documentation, or blog posts, I often use copy-and-paste in a similar (but less richly supported) way — I keep a scratchpad document open next to my main document, and whenever I cut something but don't know where it's going, I paste it to the scratchpad. Nothing ever stays in the hidey hole, because that's a recipe for lost work. But I often find myself in the situation where I rearrange the document, leave it for a week, come back with fresh eyes.. and realize the flow of thoughts is worse than it was before. I suspect that what Ted is asking for would help with this, by allowing me to \"view things as they were\" with a little more interactivity than just undo\/redo or version history."
