Hey all!  I'm Evan, I'm a Frontend dev from the US, but living in Europe for 13+ years (and around Barcelona now for almost 7!).  Found this group via Maggie, who was a guest on my (now on hiatus) podcast, Frontend Heroes.<br/><br/>I'm also interested in how the pieces are going to fit together when it comes to ML and AI, specifically I would really like the artist things that could come out of it, if we leave curation as an important part of the process (for example, not just feeding an ML pipeline a bunch of fugues as waveforms, but also proving the sheet music so there's context, and then leaving moments in the process open to human input to end up with more realistic results.  Sort of like "playing" the computer as an instrument)
