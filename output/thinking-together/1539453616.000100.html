<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Gregg Tavares</span> I tried to say the same thing at <a href="https://futureprogramming.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1538877649000100">https://futureprogramming.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1538877649000100</a> but not nearly as well!<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> I think it's perfectly reasonable to say "money ruined x" for some tightly scoped x. It may be because Gregg and I think of money as "the current implementation of money" where you're seeing it as something more general. If I'm right, can you elaborate on where the boundary is between "money" and other sorts of incentives?<br/><br/>This feels like an important subject. I think it's impossible to discuss "the future of programming" without facing up to the dysfunctional incentives that have led to the current state of programming.
