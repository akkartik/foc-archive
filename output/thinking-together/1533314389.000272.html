I love this question <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span>. I also get it all the time. I recently had success with a similar approach you mention. LIke <span style="background-color:#ccf">@William Taysom</span> says, it's good to know which country they want to end up in. The conversation went something like this...<br/><br/>"I want to learn Python."<br/>"Ok, cool. Do do what?"<br/>"Do buy and sell stocks."<br/>"On your own or at a company?"<br/>"At a company."<br/>"A company like Two Sigma...?"<br/>"Yes, I want a job at Two Sigma."<br/>"And they use Python...?"<br/>"Yes that's what a friend of mine who works there said."<br/>"Ok, got it. Give me a second to do some googling... OK I just found a python stock trading platform <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/">https://www.quantopian.com/</a>. It looks like they have a nice Jupyter environment and docs. Let's create an account there and go through the first few pages together...."<br/>... after a few hours "Ok, this is great. I can continue here on my own at home."
