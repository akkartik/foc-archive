In the last month I've been re-watching some of Rich Hickey's talks on the "right way" (my words) to design programming systems. I've seen many of them before, but I now have a personal knowledge base that is big enough for the insights of his talks to really <b>hit me</b>. I'm impressed with Rich's level of insight (even though it may be scoped to Clojure at times), and so I'd strongly recommend people to check out his most popular talks. There's an exhaustive list <a href="https://github.com/tallesl/Rich-Hickey-fanclub">here</a>. Some of my favourites:<br/><br/>• Simple Made Easy (for learning how to evaluate whether your language constructs are well-designed)<br/>• The Value of Values (building upon Simple Made Easy, it asks us to reconsider the information models we define for our programming systems)<br/>• Are We There Yet (building upon The Value of Values, it suggests how we could model <b>time</b> and <b>change</b> in a value-centric programming system)<br/>• Spec-ulation (asks us to reconsider semantic versioning and APIs)<br/>• Effective Programs – 10 Years of Clojure (a big-picture talk that revises all of the prior talks, and makes some additional points)<br/>For the record, <b>I've never used Clojure</b>. So don't be fooled into thinking that his talks are only relevant to people who are interested in Clojure.

As someone who’s watched 3/5 of the talks you mentioned, I really appreciate how you’ve ordered them and tied them together.

Haha it’s a rough ordering. It’s not even chronological but I think it’s a good order for watching :slightly_smiling_face:

Also I can recommend Hammock driven development. It is not strictly about creating programs, but more about how a person can create something big and elegant. This talk really blew my mind, I watched it 2 times in a row making notes :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>Your list is good btw, really like those talks
