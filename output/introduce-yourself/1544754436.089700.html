Hi all! I’m a Computational Media PhD student at the Expressive Intelligence Studio at UC Santa Cruz, working on approachable and playful mixed-initiative (AI+human creative collaboration) tools to augment human creativity. Like a lot of you, Bret Victor’s work was probably the main thing that got me into future-of-programming stuff, but I’m also inspired by games like Spore that place the process of creating stuff at the center of the play experience. More recently I’ve been thinking a lot about the problem of how to empower people to shape their digital social environments to suit their personal and community-specific needs.<br/><br/>I’m nominally an “AI researcher”, but I think the approaches to AI that are currently in vogue make a critical mistake: they focus way too much on <em>guessing</em> what people want rather than <em>asking</em> them what they want (and giving them the languages they need to answer properly). As a result, all of the AI problems I’m interested in end up also being HCI and/or PL problems to some extent, and my work keeps overlapping with future-of-programming stuff in interesting ways.<br/><br/>Some of you probably recognize me from Twitter; I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkreminski">https://twitter.com/maxkreminski</a>. My personal website and blog is at <a href="https://mkremins.github.io">https://mkremins.github.io</a>.

Hey Max, I love your article about what would programming look like if it was like sculpting instead of painting: <a href="https://mkremins.github.io/blog/sculpting-possibility-space/">https://mkremins.github.io/blog/sculpting-possibility-space/</a>.

Reducing the possibility space is done in libraries and frameworks by having good defaults. The sculpting metaphor is quite good!

"the approaches to AI that are currently in vogue make a critical mistake: they focus way too much on <em>guessing</em> what people want rather than <em>asking</em> them what they want"<br/>    Although this feels true, there's a lot to be said for just guessing - you can add it to a lot of existing products without much difficulty, and you can probably take it to market more quickly than if you needed to solve larger HCI/PL problems. So I'd say past solutions have been valuable and useful, but now you're trying to take it to the "next level".
