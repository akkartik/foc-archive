Hi! I’m a newcomer from Almaty, Kazakhstan. Thanks for the invite <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Cole Lawrence</span>! I moved to the US 8 years ago to go to boarding school. After getting kicked out &amp; repeating junior year 3 times, I ended up studying entrepreneurship at New York University. There, I launched &amp; failed my first startup, built the biggest entrepreneurship community &amp; worked at a few accelerators. I also became obsessed with discovering and trying new tools and products.<br/><br/>After I graduated last month, I moved to Palo Alto with my mom (55), who is starting a new business and restarted studies at Stanford. So pumped for her!<br/><br/>I’m working on building a remote school that teaches people how to be more efficient at work using nocode and visual programming tools. I think this could be something like Lambda School but I’m doing more research on that. I’m running two experiments until figure out the model:<br/><br/>1. <a href="http://optemization.com/home">Optemization</a>: agency that helps startups build &amp; automate ops without code. Made $16,520.<br/>2. <a href="http://optemization.com/automagic-upcoming">Automagic</a>: production &amp; curation of no-code &amp; ops content. Got 234 subscribers (pre-launch).<br/>&lt;/lifestory&gt;

:wave: really cool <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Temirlan Nugmanov</span>! I’m interested in knowing more about your work in progress with the remote school, I worked in different coding bootcamps and I feel that learning to code in such bootcamps sucks for people that only want to create their own products :joy:

welcome to the group. clearly you have that pioneer spirit that is so abundant in this group. We are a bit skeptical of course about people promising to program a computer without code. Maybe you are concealing the code, or merely running already written code, but there is always code!

I say software is ultimately never been about the code. Knowing what makes a "good home" has nothing to do with understanding the properties of wood under different conditions. I mean, yes that's vital information for process of construction, but not of the actual design and purpose. The proper process is to make the design easy to do, and then let someone or something else (whose job it is to deal with that) deal with that. I don't think that's any less valid in software.

... although it gets muddy where you draw the line between "code" and "logic", which is part of the design of software. You have to be able to specify what the software is and what it does. If "code" is that stuff you feed to a compiler, then there's no fundamental reason why the specification has to be in the form of "code" in that sense. But if "code" means a specification of data and behaviors, well then it's all the same thing. But at that rate, any tool or user interface constitutes a "language", and whatever model or info you put into it constitutes "code".<br/><br/>Personally, I agree that it's all code, and that "no code" just means, not what people traditionally associate with as being "code" ("none of <em>that</em> stuff")

:clap: <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dan Cook</span> Code is a means to the end. We need to keep focus on the business-logic. What is it that you are building/fixing and how do we build/fix it in the fastest and most sustainable way. The future of coding is more about the people than the code. How can we get more people into this ecosystem? What tools will they need? What problems are they solving? How do they interact with computer? We already have amazing tech, it’s time to bring it to the the other 99%.
