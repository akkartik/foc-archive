The potential types of papers could be:\n• Visionary forward looking research: exciting new directions or techniques that may have yet to be supported by solid experimental results, but nonetheless supported by strong and well argued scientific intuitions.\n• Thought provoking reflections: bold and unexpected results and reflections that can help us look at current research directions under a new light, calling for fundamentally new directions of future research.\n",
