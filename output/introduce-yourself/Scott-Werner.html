Hi everybody, I just found this community today through the Whole Code Catalog that was getting shared on Twitter, adding the podcast to my list as well. I’m an engineer working on design and prototyping of voice user interfaces at Adobe, primarily on Adobe Xd and previously at my startup Sayspring that focused on Alexa and Google Home.<br/><br/>Tend to stick to HN and Twitter (@scottwernerd), and ran into <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> online a while back through Ribbonfarm and his blog. Actually got into an argument the other day around code style that ended with me sending someone a link to one of your old blog posts :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>Anyway, current side project is working on an idea around reading and exploring code I got from the end of The Timeless Way of Building. I don’t have the book with me, but the drawings on the right side on page 488 are the key idea - being able to visualize how code evolves over time at different levels (project, file, class, function, etc). I’m still in the early stages, so don’t really know if anything interesting is going to fall out, but happy to chat more if that sounds interesting to anyone.
