You should share that in <#C5U3SEW6A|linking-together> But the analysis feels like it's missing some human factors. I look at my kid, who does rock climbing, and I see a guy who wants to do something _because_ it is _hard_, but he can get better at it, and begin good at it has value for him that doesn't come from efficiency or effectiveness at gaining altitude. If you look at games, the design objective is to make the person feel like they are getting better at something that it has (usually non-utilitarian) value to be good at, and make sure you are scaling that growth properly. Why do we not use similar principles in UI design? We seem to be measuring only for the first interaction, and not even for whether the first interaction motivates the second, etc. Like, I like the idea of information smell, because it hints at a human ability that humans probably like being good at - and getting better at - using.",

If you look at games, the design objective is to make the person feel like they are getting better at something that it has (usually non-utilitarian) value to be good at, and make sure you are scaling that growth properly. Why do we not use similar principles in UI design? We seem to be measuring only for the first interaction, and not even for whether the first interaction motivates the second, etc. Like, I like the idea of information smell, because it hints at a human ability that humans probably like being good at - and getting better at - using."
