Spent a bunch of time working on a technical assignment for an interview process, this week. Never done one of those before, the assignment was for a different job than I originally applied for, it exclusively used libraries and services I've never used before, and evidently <em>I'm too old for this shit.</em> :crossed_fingers::skin-tone-2:

big feels to this — I just did my first ever FAANG kinda interview, and the vibes were mad weird, made weirder by my leading with “I cannot and will not be able to move to California for this role.”<br/><br/>They seemed okay with that, at first, only to say remote was a non-starter after days and days of interview process.

Ugh. That's just disrespectful of your time and/or intelligence. I'm in Canada, so I feel the remote thing extra hard. Most jobs in my field are in the US and even if they are fully remote require US residence. Current opportunity is with a company that is considering making an exception, because they were purchased by and in the process of being amalgamated with a company that has offices in Canada. That's a gong show waiting to happen, too. :face_with_rolling_eyes:

lol, the experience got even weirder, when, today, after being told I couldn't continue on, I was contacted by a recruiter from the same company trying to recruit me for a different part of the org.

Had someone cancel 3 interviews in 2 days this week, all after the appointments were supposed to start. They want to hire me to teach a graduate-level course at a law school as an adjunct. The course starts in 11 days. No pay info available. :triangular_flag_on_post::triangular_flag_on_post::triangular_flag_on_post::triangular_flag_on_post::triangular_flag_on_post:
