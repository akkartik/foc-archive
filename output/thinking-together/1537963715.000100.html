<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nick Smith</span> <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Vladimir Gordeev</span> Though the freedom afforded by a Smalltalk image is beautiful thing (Lisp too), it can go pretty strange for a long lived object as the codepath that lead to its current state can easily be edited away.  My lesson is not that we should have more static and separated systems (though there is some virtue in them) rather Smalltalk's growth was stunted before sound dynamic semantics were realized.  Of course, it's been a long while so perhaps some more recent developments have improved stability.
