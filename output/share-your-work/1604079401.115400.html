This is a prototype I’ve been working on for browsing and reading code. The main ideas I’m exploring are spatial organization, abstracting away files, and path-aware browsing. It’s currently setup with the react-reconciler codebase and the linked canvas does a tiny tour of React hooks.<br/><br/>I'd love any questions/feedback. Would you use something like this? <a href="https://code-explorer.bypaulshen.com/?snapshot=9feb3d1a-b41e-44e6-adff-9b522414dc0b">https://code-explorer.bypaulshen.com/?snapshot=9feb3d1a-b41e&hellip;</a>

I've been thinking along similar lines.<br/><br/>What do the lines between some of the boxes mean?<br/><br/>Are the line numbers useful in this organization?

the lines are part of the path-aware browsing. when you go to definition or drag a symbol to open a new pane, it’ll draw a line from parent -&gt; child. By default, closing a pane will close all its children recursively.<br/><br/>That’s a good question about line numbers. One thing it tells you is that there’s more content above if it doesn’t start at 0 but that can be conveyed in a different way. Thanks!

I've spent the last few weeks trying to clean up and refactor a hugely complex collection of code.  Tools like this are what I'm missing.  An easy way to make a pin board of the fragments I need to hold in my head, and the relations between them.  It's 2020 and tools still don't have good ways to do this!  I applaud your efforts!  Perhaps a usage video in #two-minute-week ?

This looks great! I really like these customizable 'slice viewers'. One suggestion I'd have is to connect the line to source window at the the corresponding location in the scroll bar, rather than the top title bar.<br/><br/>BTW, have you seen <a href="http://sourcetrail.com">sourcetrail.com</a>?

Historical references that might be of interest down this vein:<br/>1. <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~spr/codebubbles/">CodeBubbles</a> (here’s a good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsPX0nElJ0k">video</a>)<br/>2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p9XUwIlhJg">Visual Studio Debugger Canvas</a><br/>3. The original <a href="https://vimeo.com/40281991">Light Table concept</a> explored alternative layouts<br/>Me and a couple of other folks were behind 2 and 3, though for 2 they removed a lot of the coolest stuff for whatever reason. It’s really cool and a really neat way to debug, though when we tested it internally, people didn’t like it for writing. This introduced a hard divide between read time and write time and not being able to fluidly transition between the two caused people to rate their qualitative experience with the system fairly low.

Another thing we ran into is that it ended up requiring a fair amount of manual gardening to make it useful and over time people seemed to spend <em>more</em> of their effort on laying things out rather than getting better at it like we thought they would.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful looking implementation :slightly_smiling_face: To take it all the way, it’s worth thinking about how you’ll tackle the tragedy of the commons and fluidity problems. Find reasonable answers to those and you’ll have something really special!

Super job, Paul! This made me really think that the abstraction level at which we usually think about “node-and-wire” programming (typically the AST level) might not be optimal for exploring codebases. Just sort of spewing my thoughts here, but perhaps it would be better to expose different representations at different “zoom levels”: for instance, if I zoomed into a file inside the code browser, it would turn into a graphical editor, but if I zoom out, I get a text representation. Or maybe it would be more reasonable to give the user a choice of which representation they wanted to see at a particular level of abstraction. It just seems like there is no “one size fits all” representation that can encompass all levels of abstraction.<br/><br/>It also made me think deeper about the notion of “incrementalism”, and how we might do well to embrace some of those ideas as a community: don’t get me wrong, there are some things that you can only do by taking a “greenfield” approach to development, but I think there is so much room for improving the status quo, that even “small” changes in representation with existing languages/tools (in this case, JavaScript and the Monaco editor from VS Code) could have on the “near-term future of coding”.<br/><br/>I think it would be really neat to explore breaking out the “show references” functionality into separate editor windows (or “blocks”) as well, something along the lines of what Dark has done in their editor  (image below).<br/><br/>Maybe the “find references” command could draw temporary arrows to the files in the file explorer window, or highlight open windows that contain references to the item in question.<br/><br/>Finally, I think this would be absolutely killer for doing collaborative code reviews/pair programming. Stellar work!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Granger</span> I’ve been linked to code bubbles and debugger canvas so many times now. I think that’s great! The ideas clearly resonate with people and it’s something people want. All 3 products you linked to are packed with good ideas and I admire them all. (i don’t claim to be doing anything new)<br/><br/>That’s really good to know re mixed feedback. My current goal is to explore the best code reading experience (ala github). The write experience seems like it’d be a natural extension but I’m learning why files and text manipulation still reign supreme. We humans are so well-versed in it haha.<br/><br/>I’d love to hear more about the “manual gardening” re debugger canvas. What did “getting better at it” mean in your head? Thanks for your advice!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Rabl</span> yeah! I love the idea of different lenses (e.g. zoom levels) on the same underlying. One thing I definitely want to explore is presenting the outline view somehow (high-level AST - e.g. functions, classes, etc.).<br/><br/>I think your point of “incrementalism” is really important. When I hear “future of code” (or prompts like “what does coding look like in 10 years”), my mind jumps immediately to inventing PL and completely new tools. But you don’t need to convince me that if I tried to built an editor, even I wouldn’t end up using it. Actually another one of my projects was building something Dark-like (something I admire a lot) but with JS and monaco-editor panes on a canvas, very similar to the demo I linked to. Dark has so many good ideas and I love the exploration but I think it’s going to be hard to get people to learn a new language/editor today. Honestly, the most “impactful” thing I could do is probably build a VSCode extension but I want the space to explore for now.<br/><br/>Thanks for the ideas and kind words! Imagine a Github browser and pull request UI that looks more like a canvas. That’s the direction I’m stumbling towards.

Initial rambles:<br/><br/>one thing I’d think about is getting a little more task-focused (this is already a pretty task-focused interface)<br/><br/>I find myself creating a kind of mise-en-place in iTerm windows where I’m setting stuff up for some larger change or understanding. I think theres some implicit structure here that you’re hinting at with the child-pane relationships, and the notes that are free-floating vs the notes that are implicitly linked to certain views (e.g. “this is the code when <tt>useMemo</tt>…). I think the structure isn’t so much the code as it is code-and-task. I’d guess/hypothesize that the hierarchy actually goes big note (“let’s look at the hook <tt>useMemo</tt>”), annotation-style notes (on mount, it calls the given..)  -&gt;  code symbols. theres a graphy-outlinely thing here (although I prefer these panes to say a workflowy interface, since in my experience stuff looks like a graph when youre working on it and an outline when you’re done)<br/><br/>maybe it’s actually that your notes are suggesting a transclusion— let’s look at the hook useMemo could be a notion-style slashword interface for pulling up code fragments that come immediately after where you typed in a separate pane<br/><br/>I really like the interface in macOS where you can box-select a bunch of files on the desktop and right click to collect them all into a folder. this feels like it could use that kind of a grouping construct

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Garth Goldwater</span> i’m still formulating my thoughts but I think canvases might not be ideal for knowledge transfer (documentation). Along your lines of thought, I <em>think</em> documentation wants to be in a more linear format (e.g. notion doc or markdown file) so that it’s readable with ability to drill down/explore on the side.

i suspect that documentation is kind of like a wiki—locally linear pages but globally a graph, with individual narratives referencing the same fragments more than once

I want to mention gtoolkit (comes up here often, but relevant to this thread). It provides the "column view" of exploring a code/system down a specific path.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Paul Shen</span> some more feedback: I'm not sure drawing to code line is ideal. Just scrolling will cause the line to move and most lines will still be pinned to the top or bottom (out of view). However snapping the connection to the 'scroll bar location' which is more stable and visually provides the location of the sub-window in the parent window.<br/><br/>One issue I had browsing around was scrolling in the canvas vs scrolling within a window. Since it's the same shortcut, often I scroll in the window when I want to pan the canvas. Would be nice if I had to click to make it active first.

Like you suggest, there might a tweak here without going full canvas.<br/><br/>VSCode has “peek” windows but they feel too ephemeral to me and hard to navigate with keyboard.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Shalabh</span> Oh yeah I misread your initial comment. I might give that a shot<br/><br/>re: scrolling. I was thinking of adding a delay on editor hover before activating scroll and seeing how that felt. You can also spacebar+drag and middle-click drag to pan canvas to avoid scrolling.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Szymon Kaliski</span> I don’t know that it’s insurmountable, but I suspect the solution won’t be obvious. Part of the problem is that counterintuitively navigation has become much more heavy weight. Instead of only dealing with one dimension of movement, you now have two and while you could just scroll in the current window, you’re then messing up your nice flow graph layout. What we saw in our studies was that people ended up generating lots of little boxes that they then spent effort trying to keep track of and garden. This is one of those things that doesn’t come up in most demo-y contexts, because the flow of navigation tends to be very unidirectional in the examples we give. But moving between those editors is a full blown context switch, whereas scrolling around is cognitively lower burden. This is why LT tried out some other ideas (three stacks where only the middle one is controlled by you and a stack itself acted like a document, documents made of disconnected blocks, etc), but they also had interesting issues, namely that it turns out files provide a kind of hidden context that’s important for both understanding and navigation.
