Hello everyone,<br/>I've been interested in visual language design for general communication, especially communication of scientific and mathematical concepts in a rigorous manner, for a decade now. One goal is to put a stop to scientific handwaving by forcing explicit clarity, another is to allow for richer communication (more detail and precision without overburdening the audience), but the guiding philosophy is really to externalize thought as faithfully as possible. Telepathy is the ideal.<br/>I'm not a coder, so I was pleasantly surprised that what scientists have largely neglected is a hot topic (of sorts) in the world of software engineering. I hope to learn from you all and share ideas from an angle on visual thinking and communication you may not have encountered before.
