Was about to lament, "I surely am not going to read those today," when already subscribe to the blog as well.  (Same people different venue.)

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Brendan Zabarauskas</span> something about dependent types feels icky to me.  It's taken reflection over years, but it boils down to principle typing being a sweet spot where you can ask what is <b>the</b> type of an expression.  Knowing additional properties is nice, but there's finesse: what additional type information is relevant for a given task.  For example, within a library you really want to know that data-structure invariants are maintained, but as the user of the library you're happy to ignore those details.

Hello Friends,<br/><br/>I've been kicking around this Slack since roughly the get-go, since Steve Krouse started the FoC podcast, since before the introduce-yourself channel, so I've never introduced myself properly.  You'll most often find me sharing Rubyisms, mixed reality musings, spacial computing speculations, and the rare Aspect Oriented reflection, while being mostly busy writing little, tricky Rails apps for running big auctions.  What with a good chunk of 5G spectrum allocated and 6G only a glint, I have the chance to dedicate some proper time to FoC projects.  I want to work on something!  Who is looking for a comrade, a consultant, a hired hand, or to just chat?<br/><br/>Most anything and everything I see on the FoC Slack matches my interests remarkably well.  Most recently, in the process of distilling lessons learned from fourteen years of modeling the domain of umpteen slightly yet significantly different auctions, a shockingly beautiful conceptual crystal sublimated, a not-so-future-required technique for leveraging data's functional dependencies to make long-distance object referencing reasonable.<br/><br/>For instance, with <tt>the.package_bid = some_package_bid</tt>, we can talk about <tt>the.price</tt>, <tt>the.bidder</tt>, even <tt>the.previous(:round).price</tt> short for what might usually amount to going up and down a tree:<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">some_package_bid.area_bid.round_bid.round.previous.<br/>  round_bid(some_package_bid.area_bid.round_bid.bidder).<br/>  area_bid(some_package_bid.area_bid.area).<br/>  package_bids(some_package_bid.encumbrance_level).<br/>  find{_1.option == some_package_bid.option}.<br/>  price</pre>
