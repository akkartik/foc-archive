I am the default leader of the next-gen language developer's association, and try to coordinate and communicate with the key members of the development teams who are working on the next generation language, which includes Parasail, Red, Luna, Beads, Elm, Chapel, etc.  It is a very competitive situation, but since inertia is the most powerful force in the universe, we new language enthusiasts need to stick together enough to get the masses to realize that there is a major problem out there, and that JavaScript (a blatant but uncredited copy of Macromedia's ActionScript 2) is not the end-state.
