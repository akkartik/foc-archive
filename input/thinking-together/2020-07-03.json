This very quickly devolves into a classic black box optimization problem.\n\nI can easily imagine someone spending hours tweaking the wording in their comment to try and get the model to generate the right code. How is that better than what we do today where we tweak code or add annotations to try and get the compiler to produce more optimal code? This is worse because natural language is not nearly as structured (The search space is much larger) and the ML model is much more stochastic than an optimizing compiler.\n\nSecond, think about when, even after the presenter \"fixed\" the comment, the model produced code that was *almost* right, but had a bug. The 80% off instead of 20% off.\n\nThe presenter writes that off as no big deal, and in a small toy example like this it is easy to find and correct the error. But can you imagine that situation in a much larger code base? Or even a single moderately complex function? It's well known that reading code (and understanding it) is much harder than writing it. Anybody who has had to fix a bug in a dense legacy code base will tell you, it's way harder to find the bug than it is to fix it. Often, even if you were the original author!\n\nThis feels less like \"pair programming\" from the future, and more like \"instant legacy code generation\". :cry:\n\nI think ML is good in general, but I personally feel like this is a case where more black box magic makes things worse.",

But can you imagine that situation in a much larger code base? Or even a single moderately complex function? It's well known that reading code (and understanding it) is much harder than writing it. Anybody who has had to fix a bug in a dense legacy code base will tell you, it's way harder to find the bug than it is to fix it. Often, even if you were the original author!\n\nThis feels less like \"pair programming\" from the future, and more like \"instant legacy code generation\". "

                "text": "A while back Weichang Du and I designed a spreadsheet based on intensional logic, the&nbsp; logic of values that vary over a coordinate space.\nSpreadsheets are a natural fit for &lsquo;intensifying&rsquo; because a sheet is already a two-dimensional intension, varying over the horizontal (A, B, C, &hellip;) and vertical (1, 2, 3, &hellip;) dimensions. But we can do better than just redo Excel with intensional semantics. Intensionality opens up some interesting possibilities; like user-defined operators, time varying sheets, or nested sheets.\n\nThis post is based on the IEEE Software article Du and I wrote, A Three Dimensional Spreadsheet,&nbsp;but with a different notation (to simplify the presentation).\nThe Fibonacci Numbers\nLet&rsquo;s start with a simple example &ndash; the Fibonacci numbers. Suppose we want to compute them and display them in row 1. In Excel it&rsquo;s easy peasy, we put 0 in cell A1 and 1 in cell B1; then A1+B1 in cell C1, B1+C1 in cell D1, C1+D1 in cell E1, etc. The formulas in the cells are\nA   B     C       D       E      F\n-----------------------------------\n0 | 1 | A1+B1 | B1+C1 | C1+D1 | ...\n\nand the values displayed are\nA   B   C   D   E    F\n-----------------------------------\n0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | ...\n\nNotice that the formulas in the cells are all different; although if you know Excel, you know that they are all &lsquo;copies&rsquo; of the formula in C2. Not literally copies, but functional copies. The value in cell E1 bears the same relationship to the two values on the left as C1 does to the two values on its left.\nConfused? Never mind, it all works out more simply with the intensional spreadsheet.\nThe basic idea is that we define a sheet (which needs a name, say F) by putting expressions in cells. The difference is that they are in the language of two dimensional intensions. Let&rsquo;s call the horizontal dimension h and the vertical dimension v. We need space versions of the traditional Lucid temporal operators first,&nbsp;next, and fby. (Plus prev).\nLet&rsquo;s call next.h right and prev.h left (for obvious reasons). Then we put the following formulas in the cells A1, B1, C1, &hellip;\nA   B          C                      D                       E                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0 | 1 | left F + left left F | left F + left left F  | left F + left left F  | ...\n\nThe first thing to notice is that apart from the first two, the formulas are exactly the same. Copying in the intensional spreadsheet is just that.\nAlso evaluation is just that. To get (for example) the numerical value of the cell D1, we evaluate the formula stored in D1. This evaluation will entail evaluating the formulas in C1 and eventually in A1 and B1, the base cases of the recursion. Note that this is eduction (more below).\n[It&rsquo;s been pointed out that you can get something close to this with R1C1 notation. R[-2]C is the cell two columns to the left on the same row. This notation is not as general; for example we can write left(F+left F).]\nAbsolute References\nIt should be clear that most spread sheets are easily formulated in the new notation. The only question is how to do what are known as &lsquo;absolute&nbsp; references&rsquo;, that are not altered by traditional copying. One approach is to use expressions like A2 as absolute coordinates; so that e.g. F.A2 is the contents of exactly the A2 cell of F (in the above, 1) and it gets copied as exactly F.A2.\nAs a special case, we have operators side and top that take us to the side and top of the sheet, respectively. So side F is F.A and top F is F.0.\nDefault Formulas\nThe fact that all but the first two formulas in the Fibonacci sheet are the same suggests some shortcuts. The user interface could allow us to select a set of cells and put a single formula into each of them.\nAnother idea is to allow us to give a default formula for an entire row (or column), with the understanding that putting formulas in individual cells overrides the default.\nAs another example we could define a sheet P by putting 1 in every cell in row 1, 1 in every cell in column A, and the default formula\nleft P + up P\nin all the other cells of P. The result is to make every column a running total of the column to the left. The result is Pascal&rsquo;s triangle (tilted to the left)\n---------------------\n| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 ...\n---------------------\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 \n---------------------\n| 1 | 3 | 6 |10 |15 \n---------------------\n| 1 | 4 |10 |20 |35 \n---------------------\n| 1 | 5 |15 |35 |70\n--------------------- \n\nGlobal Definitions\nOur spreadsheet design allows for definitions that apply globally. For example, if we add the global definition\nF2 = left F + left left F\nthen we can put F2 in cells C1, D1, E1 etc. We can have global user defined functions like\nleft2(X) = left left X\nand define F2 as\nleft F + left2(F)\nFunctions can of course be defined recursively; for example\nleftsum(X,i) = if i eq 0 then 0 else left X + leftsum(left X,i-1) fi\ndefines e.g. leftsum(F,10) to be the sum of the 10 values to the left. If we want to sum all the values to the left we can add the global definition\nleftsumall(X) = leftsum(X,index.h)\nwhere index.d is the coordinate in the d dimension.\nSpreadstreams\nSince we already have dimensions h and v it&rsquo;s no technical problem to allow the traditional Lucid time dimension t. The result is a three-dimensional spreadsheet which could be understood as a time varying two dimensional spreadsheet. For example, a traditional spreadsheet might display sales (S) of car models by salesman. With the time dimension we can do this for every month, starting with (say) January as month 0.\nThen we can have extra cells (along the side and the bottom) which display totals for model and salesman (for the current month). But with the time dimension we can also display percentage change over the&nbsp; last month. For example of D10 displays Bob&rsquo;s total month sales, we can put the formula\n100*(S &ndash; prev S)\/(prev S)\nin D11 which will now display the percentage change in Bob&rsquo;s sales.\nAnother example of a time varying spreadsheet is that for the relaxation method. It is used to give approximate solutions to the Poisson equation &nabla;2 P = 0. It is an iterative process where each (interior) cell value is repeatedly replaced by the average of the values above and below and on either side; for example, the value of F8 is replace by the average of the values of F7, F9, E8 and G8.\nWe can program this by placing the formula\nprev (left P + right P + up P + down P)\/4\nin all the interior cells.\nNested spreadsheets\nThe intensional approach allows another generalization: nested spreadsheets. By this we mean that any cell of the main sheet can (but not necessarily does) contain a whole sub-spreadsheet. And that any cell of the sub-spreadsheet might contain a sub-sub-spreadsheet, and so on.\nIndexing makes this simple: any cell of the sub-spreadsheet is indexed by two letter-number combinations. For example, if F8 has a sub-sheet, its cells have coordinates&nbsp; like F8.C10 or F8.H7. In the same way a cell in a sub-sub-sheet might have an index F8.H7.K21.\nNested sheets would allow a very natural way of representing hierarchical data. The top row of the main sheet could hold sales per year and month (two dimensions) and each cell could hold data of sales per month\/salesperson (two more dimensions).\nWe would need extra intensional operators which take us down one level or across to neighbouring sheets. We haven&rsquo;t worked out the details.\nDemand-driven evaluation\nThis all sounds extremely ambitious and even impractical; and would be if we tried to implement it with conventional techniques. For example, if the user can open sub-sheets on the fly,&nbsp; how do we know how many cells to allocate?\nIt is all made possible by a simple technique for evaluation of intensional systems, namely demand driven (lazy) evaluation; also called eduction.\nBriefly, it …",
