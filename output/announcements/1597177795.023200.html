Hey y'all! I'm super excited to share that <a href="https://parabola.io/blog/why-parabola">Parabola raised a series A round</a> :slightly_smiling_face: I joined Parabola earlier this year after this community helped cultivate my interests in flow-based languages. If anyone else is looking, we're currently hiring a few <b>engineers</b> and a <b>product designer</b>. Please take a look and pass along to folks outside this community who might be interested, especially the product design role!<br/><br/>According to the Whole Code Catalog, Parabola is a "node and wire" visual coding environment. We're building an automation platform that allows non-technical folks to import/export and process data for all manner of external services. We're driven by themes of tech accessibility, data ownership, and better paradigms of HCI. We find that once people understand our platform, they go wild and use it for everything. But a big challenge is helping new users understand how to use a new tool for thought in the first place! So we're currently focused on making things as intuitive as possible for ecommerce workflows, and have plans to bring our learnings to more general domains. If that sounds exciting to you, please apply!
