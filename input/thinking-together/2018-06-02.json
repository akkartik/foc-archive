Though we're in the midst of the liveness choir here, you are sure to find many outside who don't share our enthusiasm – often from those who found success despite poor visualizations.

Should have asked, \"what's that all that over the chalkboard then?\")  I suppose it's partly the curse of mastery: once you arrive you forget the scaffolding.

Though we're in the midst of the liveness choir here, you are sure to find many outside who don't share our enthusiasm – often from those who found success despite poor visualizations.  (More than one of my university math professors felt diagrams were near useless.  Should have asked, \"what's that all that over the chalkboard then?\")  I suppose it's partly the curse of mastery: once you arrive you forget the scaffolding.  Add to that an aesthetic preference for graceful proof arches with all the motivating scaffolding removed."
