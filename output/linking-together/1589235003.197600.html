Okay, here is a major, complex issue. Many of us here are creating new programming languages. These new languages require libraries, which, for maximum benefit, need to be written in the language itself. As a result, we are all reinventing the wheel, porting code written in other languages into our language. We are each creating a new universe of code that has difficulty talking to code in the other universes that others of us are creating. I can hypothesize a future of coding where you can write code in any language you want, and use libraries written in any language you want, and it all just works. Is anybody here working on that?

To me that sounds a bit like GraalVM.

I think we don't talk nearly enough about marketing, adoption, etc. We're seemingly all focussed on collecting the underpants, and that step 2 is "...", at least as far as we've seen from everyone here... aside Storyscript, I guess.<br/><br/>We might all be thinking about it, but don't feel like there's room in this community to discuss it, or that there might be some social cost. For instance, I know exactly how I want to market (ie. talk about, document, illustrate, stylize, etc) Hest when the time comes. But I don't think I'd want to talk about that here, at least not in #general.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Doug Moen</span> It's an important issue, but it has been discussed here now and then (without finding a solution of course). Not sure that this suffices to make it trivial!<br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> GraalVM is one attempt to address this issue, like other multi-language VMs (.NET for example) at a less ambitious level. They shift the problem from the language to the VM level. The VM still imposes a world view that may not fit some particular language.

&gt; I think we don't talk nearly enough about marketing, adoption, etc.<br/>After you start getting adoption, you also get feedback from users about what actually trips them up in your newfangled language.<br/><br/>Only been in the community for a bit, but it doesn't seem like we do a lot of watching how people learn to code. There's some 'observing what bugs people actually write', but probably still not enough.<br/><br/>Seeing what gets people excited, confused, motivated, etc. about current languages (especially as they learn them for the first time) is  powerful.

It's not all the simple things, only those with many clearly different but not necessarily better alternatives.

I don’t think we talk about the logo or if green is really the right color<br/><br/>Just kidding :four_leaf_clover: I don’t think we talk about what effect we actually want our new FoC project to have whether than be on the market, users, or world. For all the Bret Victor talk, if your solution were done and working what would really be different about the world? And maybe we should work backwards instead...

Turns out the logo proved useful conversation the other day.  "Let me check the url... oh it's <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/">https://futureofcoding.org/</a>."

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> thanks for the shout-out. I strongly believe the future of coding is more about the other 99% of the world instead of the 0.3% that already know how to code. Incrementally better languages are not improving accessibility to "coding"... We have to rethink this paradigm entirely which is exactly what Storyscript is doing.<br/>
