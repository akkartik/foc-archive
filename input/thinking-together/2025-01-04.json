        "text": "*\"Our tech is shaped by our need to make money\". Apps and services are discrete items because they need to be packaged for sale or hire.* These are my New Year musings. I'm curious if anyone else has thought about what influence _our need to make money_ has made on the shape of our tech. App stores definitely promote the idea of discrete units that can be sold\/hired because they make a cut of the transaction. I'm sure there's also an _I made this_ factor playing out. I guess I'm wondering what if _collaboration_ was the pervasive modus operandi? What would our tech look like then? What if we didn't need to package apps up as discrete branded units? What would the tech world look like? How would we build functionality? What if we never needed to earn anything from software? How much better could it be? What restrictions do we place on apps because we need to make money from them? And how much better would they be if we didn't need to do that? Purely from a technology angle. Even though there are loads of non-profit open source projects creating tech we are still stuck in the more pervasive paradigm of packaged units of code. How much better could we be? Of course, this is a pretty simplistic view of the world but anyone ever thought about this stuff?",

In both cases, control that was previously wielded by the vendors of software must be surrendered to the user. This invalidates a handful of dominant business models, like holding user data hostage or forcing users onto an upgrade treadmill. These movements (local-first \/ malleable software) are interesting because they started with a strong technical argument — if we change how we do things, our software will be greatly improved — and later revealed the perverse incentives that stopped things from evolving this way naturally. So, yeah, I complete agree with everything you said <@U0768BNPTEY>.",
