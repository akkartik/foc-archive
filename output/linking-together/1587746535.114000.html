This article gets to the nub of why I believe the future of software has to involve reinventing our organizations:<br/><br/><a href="https://app.spectator.co.uk/2020/04/22/the-illusion-of-certainty/content.html">https://app.spectator.co.uk/2020/04/22/the-illusion-of-certainty/content.html</a><br/><br/>Paraphrasing slightly:<br/><br/>&gt; Only in crises do organizations find a budget for probabilistic interventions. Bureaucrats and businesspeople are slaves to the illusion of certainty. Standard cost-cutting ‘efficiencies' can usually be ‘proven' to work in advance; more interesting lines of enquiry come with career-threatening unknowability. Since cost-savings are more easily quantified than potential gains, business and government increasingly provide people with more, poorer things at an ever-lower price. But studies show that people really like fewer, better things at a slightly higher price.<br/>In other words, organizations are started to "make something people want", but <em>by their very structure</em> are only able to do so for a bounded time.<br/><br/>To make something lasting, we should all be retreating from situations that permit drive-by judgement, and seeking out deeper appreciation. It won't scale, but that's ok.<br/><br/>Warrens, not plazas (<a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/10/27/warrens-plazas-and-the-edge-of-legibility">https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/10/27/warrens-plazas-and-the-edge-of-legibility</a>)<br/><br/>If you grow larger than your audience, you lose the accountability that is essential to forge your creation.<br/><br/>Cc <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Scott Anderson</span>
