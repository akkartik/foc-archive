Hi everyone! I have just posted this question to hackernews and got to the frontpage. One of the comments suggested this channel but I don't really know anyone. (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20431879">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20431879</a>)<br/><br/>I am 26, have a BSc in computers science. I did not go further to MSc, because I deeply felt my university does not emphasize the right things. Eg. we barely learned about FP and nothing on Dependent Types, but my interest was always to write the cleanest and most expressive code possible.<br/><br/>I tried to look up and search many things in the last years: OOP, Uncle Bobs Clean Code series, classic GoF Design Patterns, DCI Architecture, Prolog and Logic programming, UML, Statecharts, reading on FP &amp; Type Systems, research on Temporal Logic and model validation, TDD, property based testing, using (runtime) assertions to reason, Eiffel and Design By Contract. None of these made me happy, I always felt something is just missing. My intuition said it is closely related to logic, reasoning, and boolean "tagging" of values/objects as "properties" (how to model odd/even numbers), the support of incremental implementation of code, plus a huge one: some help/reasoning on ordering of computations: aka taming async code which might get complicated really quickly... and of course some neat IDE support for that: neat "views" to focus on different but related parts of the implemented code and study their relations with or without other logic statements already coded up.<br/><br/>2 years ago I have found a youtube video on Idris and Dependent Types from Edward Brady and I was fascinated. I've seen the "properties" part I was looking for, the holes in code and some awesome self-written definitions, awesome case split. I googled Dependent Types, I have found Agda, Coq and Idris, checked some videos about them, but I was not sure if they are what I am really looking for or is there something more. This lead me to write the Ask HN post I mentioned above, I wanted to make sure I am not missing anything before investing in learning Dependent Types.<br/><br/>After reading the comments and connecting some dots I think the main intuitions I had are addressed exactly by Dependent Types, but I am really curious about further/other ideas what are going on, plus to join to a community who might use these tools.<br/><br/>I am wondering about the jobs and the fit of Dependent Types for my personal projects. I am a game developer now (Unity), but before that I used React / React Native, I am really interested in bindings with these technologies, but maybe it is not even necessary. I'd really happy to learn about real world options, how/where to use DT to make some money.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Pezo - Zoltan Peto</span> Hi there, almost the same trajectory in the academic side and have felt this dissatisfaction myself. I totally get your itch to write elegant code and I have explored some of the things you have mentioned there. And your feeling of coming out unsatisfied with those methods is on point, because most of those fields are actively researched. As you intuited, logic is indeed the place I arrived at to finally understand what is going on.<br/><br/>I am out of my depth about the last statement of making market value capture by learning logic (though theoretically possible). But if that's not a priority I can show some ways up the abstraction hierarchy that might unite all of CS and help you probably arrive at at least one good way to express your programs elegantly (Mind you, it would be a big dump of pointers which I haven't myself untangled but shows great promise. So it would be like someone lost sharing his bits of the map he collected on his way).

I'm afraid type theory isn't a sufficient priority for me that I'd go to a new channel for it. But if y'all posted things on existing channels, I'd tend to superficially skim them. (Which is, I suspect, the worst possible way to engage with theory..)

Hi, I am sankha93. I have worked a bit on type theory - but not on the theoretical side of dependent types. I am more interested in how we can get these ideas to common languages that people use everyday. I don't know if you have looked at type level computations - they are a limited for of dependent types and have a lot of power. A recent paper that I co-authored brought type-level computations to dynamic languages (like Ruby) and we found bugs in website in Discourse etc.

Hi Pezo! This is the first time I've seen another person here mention DCI, but that's the thing that first got me thinking that something is wrong or missing in software. I think Jim Coplien has a good view of what part of that thing is though, and following his stuff led me to other things (most directly, to Alan Kay and Christopher Alexander (whose work in physical architecture inspired software Design Patterns)).<br/><br/>Anyway, I spent more than a year trying to wrap my head around DCI, like what it is <b>really</b> about, and that's opened my eyes on some things -- though I don't think DCI itself fixes anything. That started me on similar journeys to understand that OOP and Design Patterns and many other things have fallen far from what they were originally about, etc. etc. Funny thing is that "Uncle" Bob Martin understands this and explains it to some degree, but most software folk that subscribe to him (and his "clean code" architecture) wind up excited about new ways to make software more and more needlessly complex and mechanistic.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd be interested in discussing more of this with you, and hearing your take / journey, if you're interested.<br/><br/>I think most people in this community have some story or journey to tell :)

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dan Cook</span>! Thanks for your response! :slightly_smiling_face: I am glad to have a conversation on that! :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>I have seen almost all Uncle Bob episodes and read the GoF book and many other OO &amp; Design Patterns books because I was really curious what was going on with these “patterns” when started to study OO at the university in my country, Hungary.<br/><br/>OO and Uncle Bob and their debate (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtHQGs3zFAM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtHQGs3zFAM</a>) led me to DCI and Jim Coplien. The first couple times I did not get DCI, I think despite Jim tries hard he can’t explain the essence of DCI. This guy, Andreas Soderlund does better job I think. ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ebZHUixa0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ebZHUixa0</a> ). Or maybe his understanding is not proper which would mean neither is mine! :smile:<br/><br/>I really think that the nature of the problems (at least the harder=more important) we want to address through computing is “dynamic” - something which needs runtime information and runtime bindings. Complexity arises for sure when I can’t just “enumerate” all the possible states/relations “static”/“compile” time and I need to postpone some computation until multiple pieces of information are gathered together. Because of that I felt I’m just done with Class-based OO and I’ll rather focus on “compositions” (over inheritance) and runtime behaviour. At this point I thought something might still be “over there” in OO I’m not aware of, and when I first met DCI I deeply thought/“felt” this will be the thing!<br/><br/>What I have in my mind for a long time is that the same object can play multiple “roles” in multiple “contexts”. (The funny thing is that this comes from Prolog which I studied for a half year at the uni and I was amazed how flexible it is with the “relations” between “objects”/“facts?“.)<br/><br/>Furthermore these roles and contexts often need runtime information to put them together (here is the “dynamic”) but I just could not find out how to express that, I was looking for something “deep” and in retrospectively more powerful (than DCI). I really thought if that is deep that must be hard and I did not notice the elephant in the room.<br/><br/>At the same time I started to look into FP and think about the corresponding FP variant of any OO piece of code. Today I am 99.9% sure there is no feature of OO which would be superior to FP, if you are interested I might create a post on that. But basically DCI itself seems to me just a really really simple pattern: creating and (dynamically) populating data structures which do have references on other data structures which do belong together. Bam. I really think there is nothing more than that.<br/><br/>I found Andreas’ video 2 weeks ago so I am really happy to discuss this topic, in fact I have already created a tweet with a related question to Jim and Andreas.<br/>It addresses the problem of asynchronicity and parallel/concurrent computing which is the root of all evil in my code even if there is no more than 100 lines. It just blows up if I face these issues and I immediately corner myself so there is no way to refactor out myself from that horror. So these days I am focusing on these and I was wondering what DCI says about that.<br/><br/>Look here: <a href="https://twitter.com/ZoliPeto/status/1151101824595910657">https://twitter.com/ZoliPeto/status/1151101824595910657</a><br/><br/>And this was literally my last attempt with OO, since that I had some deep thinking on the topic and I am sure neither OO nor DCI have real solution for taming the complexity in software, its in FP with Types.<br/><br/>I do get and agree with many of your points: DCI as “something promising”, Uncle Bob’s half-baked solutions, OO &amp; Design Patterns as the rigid opposite of the wannabe flexible themselves.

The very shameful and ridiculous fact I’ve found with OO is that it doesnt say anything on correctness except “the thing”: <tt>Tests</tt>/<tt>TDD</tt>. LOL, OO addresses other mechanisms to solve the main issues! Very limited compared to Agda/Idris/Dependent Types/Proof assistants/God knows what else. I’m just scratching the surface with these. <span style="background-color:#ccf">@prax08</span> might know more about what is out there.

I'll bet there's a lot we could discuss that wouldn't all fit in this thread (not in any short amount of time anyway). For now I'll do my best to pick through one piece at a time in this thread, in part because of the good that comes from all the discussions here being out in the open.

Coming back to this much much later, the thing that this all brings to mind for me is how nasty it used to be to make JavaScript look like class-based OO, and how the industry was starting to figure out than function closures (e.g. over passed arguments) are much better and really all you need ... until class <em>syntax</em> was added to ES6 (with all the same problems) and everyone quickly forgot this lesson.<br/><br/>But anyway, now I see classes as a weaker clunkier model of closures.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dan Cook</span> I arrived to new symmetries. All of these below are essentially the same thing: 1. they have private state 2. can be instantiated multiple times 3. are waiting for events/messages from the outside:<br/><br/>object ~= process ~= thread ~= closure ~= function (+ its live call on the stack! - but it is ephemeral) ~= computer ~= machine<br/>and<br/>also ~= eventStream (but in HOT eventstream case state is in the subscriber or you can say in COLD case the eventstream itself has the state [of all previous events])<br/><br/>EventStreams (+subscribers) are special, because you can split the (3.) events from the (1.) private state - and manage the event part on a higher level of abstraction (via Stream operators) AND this is the only way to handle (model) parallel async computations sensibly! I’ll go with that for sure!<br/><br/>Rx for the win, cyclejs for the win, old Elm for the win (not anymore), Reactive Functional Programming ftw, etc. (Clojure &amp; Haskell has stuff for that, maybe even Scala based on my research)<br/><br/>Though, I’d like to use stuff with React Native and reuse my knowledge in the JS(TS!) world so I am focused on cycle.js these days; it has react extensions - working with React Native as well. For iOS there is ReactiveCocoa out there - I am considering that as well, because Apple seems to be so much ahead and it would be nice to program Apple Watch.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@prax08</span><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Shalabh</span>
