Except that then the thread is tied to ONE change, and each topic must have a single associated change (or set of changes), and that might be hard (a city is not a tree).\n\nMy vote would be to use issues as topic-threads, but then also have documents that list them by category and link to the issues. There are multiple ways (and reasons) to group things, so a single topic could be linked from different contexts."
