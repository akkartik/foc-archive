Hi Daniel, yes I've been doing a lot of experiments around this pattern. I haven't tried code bubbles specifically but in general the paradigm of editing a bunch of segments of connected code in "tiles" instead of arbitrary file blobs I think has potential if done right....I am a big fan of the "minimap" birds eye code view that sublime text really pioneered by executing the first very fast useful version AFAIK....recently I posted to see if they had considered something like code bubbles (I phrased it as a live UML view of the code: <a href="https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/uml-sidebar-similar-to-minimap-view/44856">https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/uml-sidebar-similar-to-minimap-view/44856</a>)
