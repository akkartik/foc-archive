A tall order, but we are already seeing wonderful power management, so much time has been spent figuring this out. Batteries are and will be user replaceable.```\n6 months is probably not realistic.

A tall order, but we are already seeing wonderful power management, so much time has been spent figuring this out. Batteries are and will be user replaceable."
