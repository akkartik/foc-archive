It feels like you have a really clear _vision_, but your _description_ of it doesn't give us much to respond to. This is why people like to share mockups and prototypes — they are more of a surface for our impressions to stand upon. People who share prototypes get better feedback. Instead, what we're doing here is more like sharing what we all think a cloud looks like.\n\n&gt; I hear complacency here.\nPlease don't belittle us.

Instead we have debated politics and feelings. Clearly we are not going to have a conversation about the substance of this idea (regardless of how the format of presentation is) instead I’m going to retire from this thread as it’s getting far to personal.

And I don’t agree that I’ve been saying people are wrong; I’m expressing my concern of shallow feedback. I want to be wrong — it’s your job to point it out, that’s the point of feedback, to collaborate on ideas, ask questions, and inspire a diversity of thought. I don’t believe I got any of that. Instead we have debated politics and feelings. Clearly we are not going to have a conversation about the substance of this idea (regardless of how the format of presentation is) instead I’m going to retire from this thread as it’s getting far to personal. If anyone wants to give critical feedback, ask thoughtful questions, and inquire about our approach I would be delighted to continue a conversation."

It just means you didn’t ignite this group’s imagination. There’s something to learn from that. You could say “well the FoC group just isn’t the audience” and maybe that’s true, but I somewhat doubt that’s the case. As was said earlier, many of these folks value something that’s further along because ideas are cheap and many of us have seen how hard it is to make that beautiful slideshow into something that actually works. I honestly think this would’ve gone very differently if instead of calling this a “prototype” you had just started a thread ruminating about a concept and then explored the space together with people rather than trying to force things in a specific direction.",

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. The message fell flat - the fact that it didn’t elsewhere isn’t a statement that this group is somehow doing something wrong. It just means you didn’t ignite this group’s imagination. There’s something to learn from that. You could say “well the FoC group just isn’t the audience” and maybe that’s true, but I somewhat doubt that’s the case. As was said earlier, many of these folks value something that’s further along because ideas are cheap and many of us have seen how hard it is to make that beautiful slideshow into something that actually works. I honestly think this would’ve gone very differently if instead of calling this a “prototype” you had just started a thread ruminating about a concept and then explored the space together with people rather than trying to force things in a specific direction."
