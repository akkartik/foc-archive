<b>Concatenative Programming Projection</b><br/><br/>2022 – <b></b>*Interleaved 2D Notation for Concatenative Programming*<b></b> – by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Michael Homer</span><br/> Some quickly enlightening demo videos here:<br/> <b><a href="https://michael.homer.nz/Publications/LIVE2022/article/">https://michael.homer.nz/Publications/LIVE2022/article/</a> &lt;&lt;&lt; THIS IS GOOD</b><br/> Landing page: <a href="https://michael.homer.nz/Publications/PAINT2022">https://michael.homer.nz/Publications/PAINT2022</a><br/> Tryable in the browser: <a href="https://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~mwh/demos/p22-2d-concat/">https://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~mwh/demos/p22-2d-concat/</a><br/> Direct link to the paper: <a href="https://mwh.nz/pdf/paint2022">https://mwh.nz/pdf/paint2022</a><br/> It's a concatenative language.<br/> It's not a stack based language. Slight differences I guess.<br/> Also questionably point free with with the values unnamed but live values still shown.<br/><br/><b>Comparison to stack based languages</b><br/><br/>★ <b></b><b>Similarities to a stack based language:<b></b></b><br/> – also no variable names<br/> – also the typical operations: dup, swap, dig<br/> – also only variables with an arity of one or more (aka functions) are shown (and literals)<br/> ★ <b></b><b>Differences:<b></b></b><br/> – There's no reverse polish notation.<br/> – Unlike in in a stack based language there's no single stack.<br/> Rather the representation make opportunities for parallel evaluation quite obvious.<br/> – Variables have no names but are still displaying their live value like in a spreadsheet (not referring to the layout).<br/><br/> :warning: <b></b><b>It seems this is actually not a language but a projections style.<b></b></b><br/> This is nice, meaning to some degree other language can potentially be projected into this representation.<br/> Well, plus-minus some issues. Syntactic sugar mostly not carrying over. Readability in other projections.<br/> Switching to a different projection one may want to give out human readable variable names though rather than assigning auto-generated ones.<br/><br/> Maybe this would be a viable additional projection target for some other languages (unison)?<br/> No clue though how this would interact with algebraic effects.<br/><br/><b>Comparison to ALDs</b><br/><b>(<b> <a href="http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram">http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram</a> </b>)</b><br/><br/><b></b><b>Relation of Michael Homers model to annotated lambda diagrams:</b><b></b><br/> ★ ALDs give same obviousness of parallelity opportunities<br/> ★ Unclear which representation is visually denser but likely not the ALDs<br/> ★ ALDs (as in the current mockups) are not pointfree. Variable names do appear both …<br/> – at the head of the function definition (and tops of let- and in- blocks) and<br/> – as annotations of the horizontal value lines (i.e. as the arguments to functions)<br/> ★ For Making the ALD code projection more aligned with Michael Homers model:<br/> – replace value names with live values<br/> – collapse let-in-blocks by substitution<br/> (live values could still be added as "syngraphic" sugar in extended value lines, I digress …)<br/> ★ flip &amp; dig (argument permutators)<br/> – They both vanish in the ALD code projection no matter their location.<br/> – They are just permuting the arguments by swapping application lines and all preceding dependents.<br/> ★ dup<br/> – only vanishes at the top level as it turns into two forks.<br/> – otherwise less trivial as it induces an unavoidable let-in block.<br/> (Uncurrying into tuples is a bad alternative as it hides away ALD circuitry, the whole point of ALDs)

Thanks, these are really useful comments & comparisons.<br/><br/>A bit of follow-up work that may be interesting is <a href="https://michael.homer.nz/Publications/PX2023">https://michael.homer.nz/Publications/PX2023</a> where it pushes the same model into a graph as well, letting the user switch between views.

This is the transition in action. It's the same model, with progressively less restriction in the text-&gt;grid-&gt;graph direction, with the text modality a typical stack language and graph a DAG (with wire-crossing, etc).

I will have to draw more connections to ALD next time I follow up on this - thanks for identifying those parallels.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Michael Homer</span><br/>I spontaneously decided to project your example to an ALD mockup to get a bit of a feeling for inhowfar ALDs are compatible with your code projection focused of concatenative code.<br/>Seems pretty good.<br/><br/>★ One nice thing with ALDs is that library functions are threated exactly the same as argument values. They come in as semi-implicit arguments via the grey collection abstraction-line.<br/>★ One annoying (but I think good) restriction of ALD is that functions (and definitions in let sections) can only ever have just one single value-line as their final output (except one cheats a bit as I've done here with memocurry :smiling_imp:).
