I recently stumbled about Spritely via this video: <a href="https://youtu.be/T8uqHCo10I8">https://youtu.be/T8uqHCo10I8</a><br/>some things that stood out for me are:<br/>•  Its goal towards a better web experience <br/>•  the agency and persona ideas.<br/>•  the Capabilities Security approach<br/>• its written in racket<br/>project website: <a href="https://spritelyproject.org/">https://spritelyproject.org/</a><br/>Any thoughts or experiences from your side? Thank you!

Love it! I’ve sent that to a couple folks before linking to the wireframes at 14:15. That and Alex Obenauer’s “<a href="https://alexanderobenauer.com/articles/os/1/">itemized OS</a>” are the closest worldviews I’ve seen to the stuff I’ve been chipping away at. I’m more interested in tools that increase people’s agency and creativity than in security per se, but Mark Miller’s <a href="https://papers.agoric.com/assets/pdf/papers/robust-composition.pdf">work</a> got me excited about how well the two aims mesh.

I agree with all their goals. I just don't see what it will do about the really wicked moderation problems for which they spent so much time castigating the current platforms. Sure, their revocable ocap system would help with direct harassment, but that's not the really tricky, toxic problem. In particular, more private communities (which, granted, were not invented by this project, just hopefully made easier) probably make disinformation worse.<br/><br/>I also object to their implicit equivocation on "context", using it in their problem statement in reference to evaluating toxicity of a phrase, i.e. roughly linguistic context, and in their demo to refer to a social context for the purpose of defining an identity. These are not remotely the same thing. I doubt this was an intentional obfuscation, but they should have been more careful. "Context" is possibly even more abstract than "love", even more so in a "context" including discussions of computer science and linguistics.

Agreed- I should clarify, I didn’t find much of Randy’s portion persuasive, and I’m personally not interested in a Spritely as a way to solve any of the tricky problems you bring up. What I’m most interested in is the user interface and underlying “itemized OS” - in particular check out the workflow at 19:30. I also loved the Mark Miller cameo at 32:00 about the “ontological crisis” issue (incidentally what <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria/">Project Cambria</a>.. the other one.. was trying to tackle).

I would also be remiss not to mention WeChat, which is kind of paving the way for these kinds of UX patterns at scale. There’s no western equivalent right now, but I think there’s enormous potential for a properly decentralized alternative. Very interesting (translated) talk from the founder here: <a href="https://blog.wechat.com/2019/03/18/what-is-wechats-dream-wechat-founder-allen-zhang-explains/">https://blog.wechat.com/2019/03/18/what-is-wechats-dream-wec&hellip;</a>.
