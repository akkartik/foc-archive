It is difficult to write, and I'm still working on it.\n• I use reference counting to manage memory. I don't know any online resources that explain how to create recursive function closures without cycles, but I figured it out.\n• I use signed distance fields and implicit functions to represent geometric shapes. That's a niche technology, and I'm doing original research and inventing new techniques to overcome some of the limitations I have run into.\n• Conal's design for the Reactive part of FRP is looks complicated to implement. I'm not working on that bit right now, but I expect to encounter some challenges when I do.\n&gt; Conditional looping typically isn’t available in shaders for example\nMy oldest test machine has a 2010 Nvidia GPU: the GPU driver will accept `for` loops with a compile time bound on the number of iterations, but it will not accept `while` loops, so a subset of the Curv language doesn't work on that machine. Modern GPUs have no problem with looping, and loops are required for general 3D fractals and noise based procedural modelling. My eventual plan is to drop support for GPU hardware that predates 2012, and migrate to a modern, cross-platform GPU API (probably WebGPU).",
