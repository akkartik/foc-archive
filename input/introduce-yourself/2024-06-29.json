I am Piotr generally electronic\/software engineer (I guess this would be computer engineer) extremely interested in building experimental software and tools. I spend a lot of my time delving into Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence topics, which you can see on my github: <https:\/\/github.com\/PeterWaIIace>\n\nHowever, I came here to share my largest project so far called *EyeGestures*. It is *python* (for now) *library* enabling engineers to build gaze-driven interfaces just by using built-in webcam (so you can make your own gaze tracker or eye tracker in seconds now - no need for expensive hardware nor license!). No servers required, everything runs locally: <https:\/\/github.com\/NativeSensors\/EyeGestures>\n\nHope you will enjoy, and look forward to chat with you all!",
