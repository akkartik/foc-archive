With index cards, the ID had to be structured to make finding the card as easy as possible. Any digital pointer does better than that. Which is why many digital versions (e.g. Roam, Org-Roam, TiddlyWiki, ...) just use the title as the ID. Hierarchies can then be achieved via transclusion, or lists-of-links, etc. But in my understanding of Zettelkasten, hierarchies are optional and certainly not a central feature of the method.",
