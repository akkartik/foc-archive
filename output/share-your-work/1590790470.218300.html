I'm working on some approaches to extract sub-page/window frames out of existing apps. These frames would then exist as separate windows locally which you could arrange however you prefer, and can also be shared with other people, snapshot for archiving, etc. It would be a huge help to hear what people might want to use this ability for, so I recently tweeted to collect some feedback. Happy to have replies in a thread here or on Twitter, whichever you prefer.<br/><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/jryans/status/1266166240114020352">https://twitter.com/jryans/status/1266166240114020352</a>

I’m going to give different feedback than you asked for. Not so much how would I use this, but what is table stakes for me using this. I have a strong emotional reaction to this idea (or my understanding of it).<br/>[Non-quote to collect my scenario:]<br/>&gt; I picture a rectangle select happening on an app or a web app, and then having a rectangle primitive that I can work with (maybe it’s a window on its own, maybe I combine it with other stuff). This seems like it could be super powerful. But that is not my dominant reaction. My reaction is dread. Dread for the moment I go to scroll and my scroll gets picked up by the wrong layer and now my widget is broken. And then I spend hours/days/weeks looking for a solution to this, only to discover that the app designer is handling scroll events in a way that makes it impossible. <br/>I assume that something like this would be finnicky and fragile. I think making it <b>not be</b>, and <b>convincing people</b> that it’s not going to be is an important problem. I think remixing apps is an important goal to work towards, but I personally would have a high bar for robustness.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jared Windover</span> Thanks, happy to have feedback of any kind. :smile: Yes, I agree it's important to ensure it's a robust experience so that people can trust that these frames will behave as they expect. I think it could be quite an enabling, powerful tool / primitive, but only if you can be confident it will work the way you expect when first extracted and remain working thereafter.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Garth Goldwater</span> Ah cool, thanks for sharing this! :smile: I'm also interested in such techniques as well: further into the future, I can imagine going beyond just extracting frames from apps towards wanting to manipulate and modify them, which becomes much easier when you can detect the structure of the data on the page. I'll reply on Twitter with a bit more.

Are you guys are talking about extracting and scraping data from websites which is a very common task nowadays, Because companies don’t want to give access to their underlying data bases but The correct probing of their website you can get them to spill a lot of their data. and then you can reconstruct the data structures that generated the website. I will caution you that some of the big boys in the business such as Facebook spend a great deal of their time obfuscating the graphics and texts that are on their webpages so as to make it as difficult as possible to scrape. Facebook goes to perverse levels of obfuscation and concealment to the point where they even hide their crappy Little user interface icons, and they’re not even drawing them as JPEG’s or PNG’s from a link location. When you have engineering devoted to blocking people using the information programmatically So as to induce people to enter contractual relations to obtain the data directly such as Facebook does, you are techniques will hit  these kinds of barriers.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@J. Ryan Stinnett</span> yep—that was exactly my comment on twitter about <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Geoffrey Litt</span>’s wildcard: <a href="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/">https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/</a>, which lets you make exactly those modifications. this is just a simple way to make data adapters for it using the mouse instead of code<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@magicmouse94937</span> for the record, that’s exactly what i’m talking about! so far the code also works on facebook (don’t have time to redact all the personal data, so no video) and almost works on twitter (at least for text content extraction). one upside is that the technique works as long as they maintain a tree structure in the dom that mirrors their presentation objects. it doesn’t really care about class names or the data types of things. just makes it easy to identify normalized relationships—give me every element that’s at the same position with respect to its local tree, if that makes sense.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Garth Goldwater</span> Right, that’s the sort of thing I was hoping to see in future work at the end of my Wildcard review: <a href="https://malleable.systems/blog/2020/02/29/wildcard-review/">https://malleable.systems/blog/2020/02/29/wildcard-review/</a> I think it could be useful for any systems that want to act on page structure while avoiding the need for lots of site-specific code.
