Invariably there are formulas with exponents or multiplicative factors that are super influential to the results.

In the climate models this is a huge problem; they have matrices of training data that guarantee it looks really accurate when in reality they are using polynomial curve fitting to match the data without a real model. The other sleazy trick the climate people use is to \"adjust\" the data.

If you don't measure temperature at the same time of day it is fairly hard to fix it. You can hide a lot of bad things if your program is big enough, and the climate people have huge datasets, which prevents outsiders from checking their work in any reasonable amount of time. There has been so much data fudging it is embarrassing. The temperature of the earth is a strange thing to quote; at any point in time there is a 100 deg range of temp on the planet.  Virus simulations are way easier. If you have population density factors, along with \"packing factors\" in terms of how much people are squeezed together, and \"air recycling\" factors that would help. Also the number of days over 100 deg F, plus days above 80% humidity (above 80% humidity the virus' stick outside loses ability to stick, like a post-it note). Just in New York state alone you an see the huge difference between NYC and upstate NY which is very rural. The rural environments have healthier people, more outdoorsy, etc. You could build a simulation and tune the parameters so it matches the cases way better than the simplistic, wildly inaccurate model that Neil Ferguson used to change UK's whole policy. Groups who generate inaccurate models should be punished, and the teams with good models should be rewarded. There needs to be some accountability in computer modeling, esp. if the population is going to obey them with blind faith.",
