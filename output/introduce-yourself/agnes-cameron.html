hello, i’m <a href="https://agnescameron.info/">agnes</a> — I work as a technician and a lecturer at university of the arts london’s creative computing institute, and also work on games/writing/art-related things.<br/><br/>I spend a lot of time thinking about how people develop a sense of agency in relation to technology. I recently came across the tadi web ‘slippy mindset’ page + thought it was a great articulation of something I often try to get across in my teaching and technical work — that there’s always more than one way to do something.<br/><br/>I’m also really interested in collective knowledge structures and tools for describing/realising them — I’ve run a reading group for a few years now called the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fXfCHIDHeX1qqdZPSkj2chz0AVdvBR4-46-U87hM0sc/edit">Knowledge Arrangement Reading Group</a> (it’s an open group if anyone here wants to join) + am also an enthusiastic (if intermittent) wikipedia editor.<br/><br/>right now, I’m doing a <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/become-a-2024-bellingcat-technical-writing-fellow/">technical writing fellowship</a> with Bellingcat around diverse satellite imaging indices, thinking a lot about ‘meta-methods’ for thinking about imaging as a physical process. I’m also just starting a research project around developing knitting software, and also learning to make DIY synths (in the autumn I’m going to run a ‘circuit diagram reading group’ at the CCI where we make synthesisers together from scratch).<br/><br/>I think it’s really cool that this space exists! If anyone is based in london and wants to come visit the CCI / hang out and talk about coding things lmk :slightly_smiling_face:
