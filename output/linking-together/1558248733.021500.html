Interesting to see the term executable specifications brought up. One of the major use cases for Glamorous Toolkit is exactly this one. We found that, like <span style="background-color:#ccf">@magicmouse94937</span> is saying, we need a complete platform underneath combined with an expressive user interface. In our case, we use the Pharo language/runtime as the underlying platform.<br/><br/>The idea of a specification is that it is simpler to understand than the real system. Now, if the specification is executable, what is the difference between that and a real system. Our answer is that there does not need to be one. However, various technical considerations might impose differences, such as having only certain languages supported in the target deployment environment.  Even in this case, the specification can replace the documentation and can be traced to the actual implementation, too.
