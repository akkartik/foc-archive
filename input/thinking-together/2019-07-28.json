If you are aware of new \"older events\" later (it is weird to write this :slightly_smiling_face: ), they are not included in the revision tag T1. If you want to consider them you need to create a new tag T2. As an offline first system, you could never know what happens concurently, and you can only identify version on events you have heard about. So all this allow to identify versions without ambiguity, considering the full and complete history of the events log, with such a tag you can reconstruct a \"past\" state. But of course it says nothing on the meaning of a particular tag, i.e. there is no meaning in it for stuff like \"this is the stable version at the moment\" (as you mentionned).",

As an offline first system, you could never know what happens concurently, and you can only identify version on events you have heard about. So all this allow to identify versions without ambiguity, considering the full and complete history of the events log, with such a tag you can reconstruct a \"past\" state. But of course it says nothing on the meaning of a particular tag, i.e. there is no meaning in it for stuff like \"this is the stable version at the moment\" (as you mentionned)."
