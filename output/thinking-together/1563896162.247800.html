And the other question is, how do you distill the principles of designing coherent software into something that can easily be explained and taught? I think this is a vital component missing in almost all software education.<br/><br/>I already have some of these figured out, or at least I've been thinking about it and observing it in practice for years. It's somewhat hard to explain without visuals, but essentially it's about making your code match closely with the user mental model, and reducing the gap between code and running program.<br/><br/>Some of it is related to Bret Victor's "Learnable Programming" and "Magic Ink", but Jim Coplien's work is actually what got me thinking about this stuff to begin with. I recommend watching his "Reflections on reflection", as it ties a lot of this together (and draws parallels between Alan Kay, Christopher Alexander, Piaget, etc.): <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Reflection-OOP-Social/">https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Reflection-OOP-Social/</a>
