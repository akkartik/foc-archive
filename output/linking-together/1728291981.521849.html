This document serves as an overview to the<a href="https://stlab.adobe.com/group_<em>asl</em>_overview.html"> Adobe Source Libraries (ASL)</a>. The goal of ASL is to develop the technology necessary to construct commercial applications by assembling generic algorithms through declarative descriptions.<br/><br/>The first two significant libraries in ASL are known as the property model library (Adam) and layout library (Eve). They are components for modeling the human interface appearance and behavior in a software application. The property model library and layout library are described along with related libraries.
