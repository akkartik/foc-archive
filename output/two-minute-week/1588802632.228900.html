I've had my hands full with <em>other</em> stuff for the past few weeks, so Hest progress has been slow (as seems to be my lot, sadly). I guess this is what you get when you start messing with the timeline. Don't mess with the timeline!

I <em>love</em> the dramatic pause in the very beginning where you drop down an octave. :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: It had a surprisingly fun bit of tension to it - i_s he really going to hit that note?_

A few weeks ago, I watched a ton of the videos you have up for LunchboxSessions and I was really impressed with what you folks have out there. It's such a great idea! Certainly sparked my curiosity into what the process of creating those simulations/models must be like. I'd be really curious to learn more about that sometime. It also firmly grounded your design of Hest to me. :slightly_smiling_face:

That was delightful.  Now for the real question and most important question: are Hest path defined by Hest points?  Because if they are, you are about one inch away from awesome.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@William Taysom</span> as in.. is a path object just the composite of an infinite series of point objects? Or do you mean.. are the bezier anchor/control point objects also the same kinds of things as the colourful data point objects? Or something else? Not sure what "defined by" means in your usage.

I mean the control points.  Imagine a three paths, say, loops.  Put a point on each.  Connect each of those points to make a new time-varying path.  Then points on that path could trace out especially rich trajectories.

I think this is what you have in mind. This is from an older prototype, back when I was rendering colorful trails behind moving points. It's a (sloppy, by-hand) geometric implementation of the Bezier curve algorithm.

This isn't particularly useful (yet?) as a <em>programming</em> construct, but might be useful for building animations — it should make it easier to set up certain kinds of forward kinematics.<br/><br/>Really, it's not something I've <em>designed</em> in the model. It just emerges from exactly what you'd expect — a "point" is just an object with an explicit <em>position</em>, and an "edge" is just an object with a collection of points, and you can convey a point along an edge. That's all the model cares about. Everything else is just rendering, or aesthetic implementation choices.

It's very interesting to think of the curves as <em>defining</em> time. When you pull a point off it's going <em>outside of time</em>. Moving time backwards no longer includes that point. It's like it never existed. Whoa. An editable undo tree. What else could it be good for?

One as yet unimplemented plan is that abstraction will come from building "symbols", which are a collection of graphics / logic wrapped up into an isolated unit with a clearly defined interface — typical patcher stuff.<br/><br/>Each symbol instance will need its own sense of time. When looking at a particular instance, all child instances will execute "infinitely fast" to simulate continuous time semantics. All parent instances will execute discretely, only when necessary to satisfy the needs of the currently observed instance.<br/><br/>The GUI, including things like pulling a point off an edge, would be the ur parent of the simulation hierarchy. So if it were possible to run time backwards <em>outside</em> the GUI level, your editing interactions would gradually be undone, and that pulled point would hop back onto the edge where you pulled it off, right at the moment that you had pulled it (since the flow of time of the points-and-edges simulation is happening <em>inside</em> the GUI).<br/><br/>Not sure I'll end up going with this plan, though. I have stack of imagined "it would feel nice to <em></em>__" experiences that guide my development. I'm trying each of them, keeping the ones that feel most simpatico. So we'll see!

Also —<br/>&gt; Moving time backwards no longer includes that point.<br/>Maybe. Some rewind strategies I've played with have this behaviour. Some don't. Still trying to find the approach (likely a hybrid of strategies) that feels nicest to use.

&gt; The major problem encountered in time travel is not that of accidentally becoming your own father or mother. There is no problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a broadminded and well-adjusted family can't cope with. There is also no problem in changing the course of history; the course of history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; No, the major problem is quite simply one of grammar, and the main work to consult in this matter is Dr Dan Streetmentioner's <em>Time Traveller's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations</em>. It will tell you for instance how to describe something that was about to happen to you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping forward two days in order to avoid it. The event will be described differently according to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own natural time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the further past and is further complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations whilst you are actually travelling from one time to another with the intention of becoming your own father or mother.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Most readers get as far as the Future Semi-Conditionally Modified Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up: and in fact in later editions of the book all the pages beyond this point have been left blank to save on printing costs.<br/>-- <em>"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"</em>
