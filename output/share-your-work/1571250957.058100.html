Hi all, just launched some new features at <a href="https://storyforj.com/">https://storyforj.com/</a> .... AND we're now in public beta (this means you can sign up and try the platform out). If you're looking for something analogous to a stateful interactive doc or non-linear presentation this would be the tool for you.<br/><br/>Anyways, would really love feedback on the tool itself, and the way we're describing ourselves. We've described ourselves as a "simple app builder", "micro-experience creator" and "interactive presentation" before. It seems that in FoC land it's actually quite difficult to describe to end users what you're building. We've found that a seemingly straightforward descriptions like "app builder" to us, often means nothing to an end user.

&gt;No graphic designers, engineers, or videographers were harmed in the making of these documents. In fact, they werenâ€™t even involved.<br/><br/>hahahaha good one!<br/><br/>I really like it! Is it just a site or can you export it as instagram stories maybe? also, is a mobile app in plan? this would be great on mobile too!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ian Rumac</span> thanks! :slightly_smiling_face: I could see it working out in a mobile app as well. One of our pillars is definitely portability of the format. Letting people distribute these apps as a link (or eventually bundle of HTML files, images, etc) is really important to us. In fact, we hope to let people effectively build progressive web apps with these documents/apps at some point.

Hey Parris, some quick first impressions: I find this line to be kind of confusing: "Old document creators print to paper. This one publishes to phone.". People are already pretty comfortable with docs being online, so not sure the paper reference works.<br/><br/>Maybe something more like "Don't just write a doc, tell a story" (prob not good either, but just a thought).<br/><br/>I like the second paragraph except for "documents should be the next best thing to a conversation.". Don't really know what that means.<br/><br/>Animated GIFs are a nice touch. This looks really slick and I can totally get why someone might use this instead of a Google Doc if they're trying to present or persuade.<br/><br/>I do like the comparison to docs (or maybe slideshows?) over calling it a "simple app builder" or "micro-experience creator". Lots of people make docs/slideshows, probably no one is thinking "I want to make a tiny app".
