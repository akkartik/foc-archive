[Dependent Types][Temporal Logic][Model Checkers]<br/><br/>The complexity of Asynchronicity &amp; Concurrency lead me to the formal expression of time related logic: Temporal Logic (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic</a>) There are multiple temporal logics with different level of usefulness. (Check Temporal logics section.) I really want to solve harder problems and express deeper relations, so it seems to me what Iâ€™d need is CTL at least (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation_tree_logic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation_tree_logic</a>).<br/><br/>I thought I might want to model my software (any kind of app!) and prove it is working as intended using CTL (or other more expressive TL) in Agda/Idris (Coq/TLA+) and then make a similar implementation in another language.<br/><br/>Eg. there is an LTL implementation in Agda, but I did not find similar things for CTL.(<a href="https://github.com/xekoukou/LTL">https://github.com/xekoukou/LTL</a>)<br/><br/>What do you think, is it a good idea to express my model using (C)TL in Agda/Idris, or I should use a more dedicated piece of technology for that problem? Is there a limit in case of Agda/Idris for that in theory?<br/><br/>Any resource is appreciated!<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Sankha Narayan Guria</span> <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span>

This is interesting. I don't have much experience with Agda/Idris. I have heard they are great tools - but the proof burden is high and modelling a real software is often challenging. It would definitely doable though. It would be great if you can share your experiences.
