What we can and do now wasn't even possible in 1996 so I don't even know how to compare...\n\nI suspect the original tweet was (secretly) referring to Webpack, Babel and other pretty crazy tools to process JS and stuff which you didn't have and didn't need in 1996. But the funny thing is... you still don't need them to build Web apps in 2021 that weren't even possible in 1996. Yep, even using modern frameworks, JS and CDN.

But the funny thing is... you still don't need them to build Web apps in 2021 that weren't even possible in 1996. Yep, even using modern frameworks, JS and CDN. Babel\/Webpack\/whatever are just "
