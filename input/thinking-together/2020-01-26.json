So if the word in your program in some language was 3.14, the parser might assign it to the type *π* which extends from float which extends from numeric which extends from any. So in a type cube visualization it me be a stack of tiles with 3.14 on top, underneath would be a tile with *π,* then float, then numeric, then any. So the stack would be 5 tiles high. Now if your language didn't have the concept of numbers at all and perhaps was just strings, that stack would only be 2 high (3.14 and any). So the \"height\" is an approximation for the amount of meaning in a program.",

                "text": "The fact that we can experience one temporal object a multitude of times implies that the temporal object is not merely remembered through primary retention; in fact, the very idea of perceiving the exact same temporal object numerous times implies some kind of technical reproduction e.g. a recording device (either analogue or digital). Thus, Stiegler’s main line of argument suggests that as we can experience a melody multiple times, and our experience of that melody changes depending on the multitude of times we experience it, we must therefore have a form of technical retention, or ‘tertiary retention’ in which the repeatability of a temporal object becomes possible. Our primary retention is also therefore dependant on both the secondary and tertiary forms of retention. By Matt Bluemink.",
