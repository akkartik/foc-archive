I’m deeply interested in how developers understand and navigate the dynamic aspects of software—whether it’s debugging, running tests, deciding where to write tests, or ad-hocly writing `console.log`!\n\nRecently, I analyzed a dataset of accidentally pushed `console.log` statements on GitHub (e.g., `console.log(\"here\")`, `console.log(\"is this code running\")`) [<https:\/\/2025.msrconf.org\/details\/msr-2025-technical-papers\/7\/Learning-from-Mistakes-Understanding-Ad-hoc-Logs-through-Analyzing-Accidental-Commit|paper here>] . We hope this dataset and our methods can provide valuable insights for language designers, programming tool developers, and library maintainers—like you—on the challenges developers face in understanding run-time behavior. If you’re attending MSR or ICSE this year in Ottawa, come say hi and check out my talk!\n\nI’m also working on a tool to help developers better organize and make sense of interleaving log outputs from asynchronous and parallel programs. I will definitely  share more about it soon in the share-your-work channel.\n\nShoutout to all the amazing work shared here—I’m excited to read your ideas and get inspired!",

We hope this dataset and our methods can provide valuable insights for language designers, programming tool developers, and library maintainers—like you—on the challenges developers face in understanding run-time behavior. If you’re attending MSR or ICSE this year in Ottawa, come say hi and check out my talk!\n\nI’m also working on a tool to help developers better organize and make sense of interleaving log outputs from asynchronous and parallel programs. I will definitely  share more about it soon in the share-your-work channel.\n\nShoutout to all the amazing work shared here—I’m excited to read your ideas and get inspired!"
