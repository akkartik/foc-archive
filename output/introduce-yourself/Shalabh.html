Hi Everyone,<br/><br/>It was great to meet some of you today at the SF/Dynamicland meetup. While I've<br/>been on Slack for a bit, I never posted to introductions so here it is.<br/><br/>I'm a software engineer professionally and over time I've grown increasingly<br/>dissatisfied with the general state of affairs. It was all fun and games for a<br/>while, but then I started watching Alan Kay videos :smile:. While digging into<br/>historical ideas and banging my head against what seem to be a hard ceiling in<br/>many of the tools and systems we use, I've arrived at the position that there is<br/>a large space of possibilities that has been left unexplored while we continue<br/>to incrementally hammer away at the entrenched systems. I believe big leaps can<br/>only happen if many established fundamental ideas are changed or replaced. For<br/>instance, we store and share <b>information</b> by encoding it in a<br/>non-introspectable, very low level medium (aka files) that also loses its<br/>connections to related information, history and identity. We then redesign these<br/>features over and over in various ways in different contexts. Programs as text<br/>files is another poor representation. We re-implement the same functionality and<br/>schemas in different siloed processes and services. It seems our language for<br/>interconnection and scaling up is really poor. Much of programming deals with<br/>stuff that isn't really computing anything but just dealing with represenation<br/>changes (e.g. parsing - doesn't change the information content). Worse, this<br/>type of represenation shuffling code is tightly intermingled with the computing<br/>code. We sit in front of powerful computers, and simulate them in our heads -<br/>humans are simulating the general purpose simulator.<br/><br/>So what's an alternative? I don't know but perhaps creating a new<br/>PL/DB/framework to fit in a PL/DB/framework shaped hole in the current mess may not<br/>help. We need to explore ideas that are holisitic, ground up rethinking of what<br/>computing is, how the space is partitioned into concepts and artifacts (note<br/>files/filesystems, OS processes, databases, 'programs', compilers etc. are all<br/>means to an end, serving the users achieve some of their goals - what are the<br/>goals and what other ways can they be expressed?). How does something like this<br/>'alternative substrate' or 'new material for computing' fit onto the existing<br/>world? It doesn't, but my interest is more of a research exercise - how can it<br/>be done, what would make it complete and self sustaining? If we have some good<br/>ideas, we can prototype. Since this is broad and can go in all directions, I've<br/>been writing to try and clear my thoughts and keep moving forward in some way.<br/>If you're interested take a look at <a href="https://shalabh.com/programmable-systems/">https://shalabh.com/programmable-systems/</a>
