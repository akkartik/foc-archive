Hello there! My name is Pine and I'm an engineer at Microsoft working on VS Code. I have a short blurb about myself here: <a href="http://blog.matsu.io/about">http://blog.matsu.io/about</a>. I'm not sure how I ended up here, maybe because of the Bret Victor fan club thing, maybe because I sit below the TypeScript team room and Mr. Hejlsberg's influence seeped through the ceiling, or maybe because of the actually really good podcasts by Steve â€” anyway, nice to be here :stuck_out_tongue:<br/><br/>In my work I maintain the HTML/CSS Language Servers in VS Code, and for fun I'm building the Vue Language Server (<a href="https://vuejs.github.io/vetur/">https://vuejs.github.io/vetur/</a>). I feel Language Server Protocol is one of the interesting/new area of focuses in the language design/tooling space, and I'm exploring with programming tools that complement programming languages &amp; enable new paradigms of programming. I see many interesting conversations and links floating around, and I look forward to joining the discussions!<br/><br/>I'm based in Seattle but would travel to London/Tokyo/NYC soon. To borrow the tweet from ep35, if you are inspired by the Bret Victor talk, or the topics of LSP &amp; programming editors/tools, I'd love to meet you over coffee. Coffee is on me :wink:
