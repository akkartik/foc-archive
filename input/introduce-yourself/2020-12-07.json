I just found this community through Ivan Reese's twitter and it's so cool that there other people interested in these kinds of things! I'm always thinkering with new ways of doing things in computing too. Recently what I've been working on is a sort of mechanical programming language called MockMechanics <https:\/\/mockmechanics.com\/>. With no code you can create musical instruments that actually play, environments that you interact with and even full blown games, for instance I implemented tetris from scratch in a very short time. All these machines I've built can be seen in my channel on youtube <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/MockMechanics>. And I'm always looking at what else I can do with this system, just yesterday I implemented the bubble sort algorithm, here is a preview <https:\/\/mockmechanics.com\/mechanics\/bubble-sort.mp4> and I'll do a full build video about it soon. Anyway, I just wanted to say hi, and if anyone wants to give MockMechanics a try or talk about it (or other things) I'd be happy to.",
