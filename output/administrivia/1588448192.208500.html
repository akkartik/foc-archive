We have subject-specific channels that are hardly used (I would call these "ghost towns"):<br/>• #category-theory <br/>• #of-music<br/>• #research-center <br/>• #robust-computation <br/>We also have subject-specific channels that, while not thriving, get at least a few posts a month:<br/>• #of-end-user-programming <br/>• #of-graphics<br/>There are a bunch of folks (myself included) who have voiced a preference for keeping channels to a minimum. So if we're going to create a new channel, it'd be nice to (A) do our best to make sure it sees regular usage, and (B) have a plan in place for closing it down if it doesn't.<br/><br/>So here's what I propose doing:<br/><br/>1. Archive all the ghost-town channels.<br/>2. Create a #functional-programming channel, since that's a popular enough topic that it may see a good amount of usage. #category-theory discussions can probably happen here, too.<br/>3. Post in #thinking-together letting people know about the change.<br/>4. Revisit this in the future, and close #functional-programming if it's also become a ghost town.<br/>Let me know what you think.. <em>by replying to this post :)</em>

On a more personal note — I don't mind at all seeing stuff about Conal or FP in #thinking-together. I think it's great. So <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Doug Moen</span>, by all means, please keep posting!

Granularity is always tricky.  When I first took to Lisp, I thought the aversion to name spaces would be more of a problem than it ended up being.  Likewise with conversations here.  Perhaps the deciding factor could be: would someone want to subscribe to X channel but not Y channel.  For my part, I mostly want to subscribe to all the channels, yet I get value out of having them.  So that's not it.  Here it is: for me different channels have slightly different etiquette.  Partly that's captured by a topic, but I think it's more about the kind of conversation that tends to happen there.

i think one thing to keep in mind is how successful (at least to me) #two-minute-week has been by enforcing a topic constraint that both keeps things focused but (more importantly IMO) gives people a clear boundary of things that are ok to post even if they’re half-baked: one feeling that i at least have that stops me from posting more is simply a concern that what i’m saying is trivial or incomprehensible, and a really clear context of the type of content expected in a channel might make it easier to participate without feeling like one might be committing a faux pas

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Garth Goldwater</span> I think that's an excellent point, and pairs nicely with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@William Taysom</span>'s thought about different etiquettes.<br/><br/>I think a good idea for a channel would be something like #beginners or #newcomers, where you can post very basic questions/thoughts and there will be very strict guidelines in place about not dunking on people. I think that'd help new people have an inroad to the community, whereas diving straight into #thinking-together might be too intimidating.<br/><br/>The flip side of that is the flame channel, which.. well, my thoughts are <a href="1588430669.192800.html#1588449175.216700">here</a>.<br/><br/>So yes, in broad terms, I'm fond of channels that define new <em>ways</em> for us to interact, like #two-minute-week, #, and #share-your-work.<br/><br/>So I think we should probably have a moratorium on new subject-specific channels, unless and until we find the volume of discussion about a subject becomes overwhelming in #thinking-together.

Like in personal productivity or note taking, categories based on topics always seems like a clever idea because it comes so naturally to us, but mostly isn’t that useful. It’s better to categorize by context. Maybe that is true for Slack channels also… #two-minute-week, #, and #share-your-work seem to be excellent examples.
