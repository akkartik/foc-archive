For my first version, which is supposed to permit easy construction of multiplayer games, i am doing centralized tracked mutable state, with automatic sync during screen refresh. I don't want to try doing a real time first person shooter, because that requires full duplex communication, and for that i would prefer to have UDP packets, and unfortuantely web browsers ban UDP, you have to use TCP, which is slower and wasteful with all the ACK packets. I come from the telephony world where all the voice packets are UDP and it works great. So efficient.
