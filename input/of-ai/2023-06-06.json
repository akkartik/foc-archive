The given information suggests that the mom ran to catch the blue bus, implying she might have left the school bus. So, we can conclude that there are:\n• 3 people on the blue bus.\n• 5 children on the yellow school bus.\nAs for the total number of people involved, we have accounted for 3 people on the blue bus and 5 children on the yellow school bus. However, we don't have enough information to determine the number of people on the blue bus after the mom ran to catch it.",
