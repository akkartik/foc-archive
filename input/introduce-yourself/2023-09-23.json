I did well with programming in high school but didn't take it up as a profession until college. I started with graphic design, then moved into web design, front end, backend, and devops. I enjoy building with others, and love to see how people are continuing to use programming\/the Internet as a creative medium. Other interests: cooking, reading, and writing content that past me would have found helpful "
