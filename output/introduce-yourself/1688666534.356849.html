Hello all, greetings from Quadra Island, BC. I've been listening to the podcast for a little while now, and slowly working my way backward from what's current. Professional life started with mostly Unix-like systems, plenty of server-side web tech, from CGI onwards. I've morphed into infosec consulting of various flavours for the last 16 or so years, but still messing about with software where it helps me scratch some itch. Lisps and functional languages are recurring themes.<br/>Outside of work, there's walking our dogs on the shores of paradise, and volunteer work as a firefighter. Who needs sleep?
