This year I’m helping organize <a href="https://liveprog.org/">LIVE</a>, the Workshop on Live Programming. A lot of folk here in FoC are working on projects related to liveness… I encourage you to consider submitting your work!<br/><br/>(Here, “live programming” means “getting immediate feedback on the behavior of your program even while you’re programming it”. That includes “Learnable Programming”-style interfaces, spreadsheets, notebooks, REPL-y stuff, interfaces for live performances with code, many interfaces for making art with code...)<br/><br/>LIVE is an academic conference, but it’s attracted great work from people both in and outside the academy. Submitting a project to LIVE might be an opportunity to communicate about your work in a new way and get thoughtful feedback on it from a new community. (We have some tips for non-academics in our <a href="https://liveprog.org/#faq">FAQ</a>.)<br/><br/>The submission deadline is <b>July 7</b>. The workshop will be some day TBD <b>October 20-25, 2024 in Los Angeles</b>.<br/><br/>Feel free to DM me if you have questions or concerns; I’d be excited to help out. :pray:
