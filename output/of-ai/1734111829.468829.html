we just got Devin, pretty slick slack based workflow. Still teaching it we use python 3.10 but it seems like its quite useful for dependabot alerts. I am seeing if it can do a decent refactor or not.

holy smokes I am blown away by Devin. I can truly parellize.<br/>-I patched dependancies<br/>-refactored a part of the code base to a functional Result style<br/>-added an openAPI generator<br/>-fixed a batch script<br/>in about 30 mins, 15 mins was while walking home and just over slack. I have not pushed it much yet, the refactoring was impressive though. But all were following established patterns in the code base, but it started with the wrong version of python and kept triggering formatting warnings, but it has upgraded its knowledge base and now is quite adept at using our "just" tooling. Its onboarding fast!

Had a few days with Devin, and I think the killer feature is that is synthesises closed loop programming plans. E.g. try to accomplish X this until the tests pass. Which means it converges to verifiable implementations, not an off-the-hip guess.
