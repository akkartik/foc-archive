I don’t believe I’ve ever intro’d myself, so here goes! My winding path:<br/>1. First love was reading &amp; language - hundreds of books while homeschooling (up to 8th grade)<br/>2. Puzzles were my jumping off point into math (which I’d hated). Joined the math team and got shown how to program a TI-83, got hooked on ‘game’ programming. The ease of getting pixels on the screen has haunted me ever since.<br/>3. Undergrad at Penn in bioengineering: not the best choice of major (should have done CS/CompE), but developed appreciation for the resilience/scalability of biological systems compared to mechanized tech, as well as alt forms of computing (e.g. biomolecular logic gates)<br/>4. A bioinspired robotics class followed by a WONDERFUL intro to mechatronics intro’d me to electronics &amp; microcontrollers and connected a bunch of dots. The ability to turn ideas into real devices was heady. <br/>5. Switched to masters in robotics and did a capstone project with very talented partner. Designed a system to connect assistive inputs for people with disabilities to game consoles motivated by observations growing up with my bro. Also led to a neat collab with a rehab robotics lab using gaming for stroke rehab. Decided it was worth trying to make exist in the world &amp; entered the spooky realm of entrepreneurship.<br/>6. Have pretty much nailed the liminal space between success &amp; failure - much progress made, still no product. In the process, discovered Bret Victor, the FoC slack, Alan Kay, etc &amp; have had my mind repeatedly blown while mining computing history. The more I’ve learned, the more I’ve come to see accessibility and FoC as twin issues best tackled as a pair. Finally had some breakthroughs based on an NSF Phase I SBIR grant, &amp; am reformulating the system around proper computing atoms (h/t Alan Kay) vs a glorified config system. Feeling good about our odds if Phase II funding comes through.<br/>My thoughts have crystallized quite a bit over the past few months, and I’m looking forward to good conversations here and progress to report. Feel free to reach out; I enjoy and benefit from verbal sculpting. An emerging primary viewpoint is programming as modeling &amp; simulation (i.e. proper “science”).

I love how “the FoC slack” is between Bret Victor and Alan Kay :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
