It is about (drum roll) ... ... ... COVID-19! :mask:\nIn fact the article nicely explains the spread of the virus and the effects of collective actions on it. With lots of tunable simulations, as usual. It helps me a lot reasoning about all this. In fact I was lazy until now :sleeping: and did not try to truly understand what is going on. So thanks, Nicky. :thumbsup:\n<https:\/\/ncase.me\/covid-19\/>",
