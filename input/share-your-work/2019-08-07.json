At the risk of taking this a little too meta, and because I am currently thinking a lot about thinking, I can’t help but add a few random thoughts:\n\n(A) I don’t think the three objects in the original diagram are conceptually on the same layer. Trying to analyze differences between them, I see manifestations in the real world (both brain and electrical circuits) and abstract models (do both lambda calculus and Turing machine fall into Formal Computation?). Our brain copes with all of them, and likely has its own abstract model which is different from the ones in Formal Computation.\n\n(B) That, however, could also lead to the conclusion that maybe all three objects are in fact on the same conceptual level and just represent three different mental models optimizing for different goals by abstracting (removing) certain limiting properties: the machine model optimizing for physical implementation giving up formal simplicity (beauty) for pragmatism, the formal model(s) optimizing for a simple logic representation giving up real-world constraints (e.g. computation time), and our own mental model optimizing for understanding and applicability giving up clear deterministic rules and algorithms and replacing them with meta-cognitive constructs we don’t understand (yet).\n\n(C) When I try to put things in a visual diagram, I usually think a lot about patterns in the relationships between the objects I want to combine. As already discussed above, I also immediately thought, “are we looking at a continuum here, with objects marking certain points on that spectrum?” The extremes could be something like _physical manifestation_ and _logical manifestation_, or perhaps even bolder _concrete_ vs. _abstract_? But then what insights would this perspective really offer on top of what we already know?\n\n(D) The next thing I’d try is to look for a fourth object — are we possibly looking at a 2-by-2 with two distinct dimensions, and are just missing one element? That often works surprisingly well (and gave us a whole industry called “consulting” ;-)\nIf we keep the _physical_ vs. _logical_ dimension from (C) and try to add another one, what could be it? If we want to take the route towards adding “Worldly Goals” as the 4th object, then there is something about both the brain and the world that’s much less specific\/defined\/known than computation and hardware. I think that is partly what <@UC21F8Q48> expressed with “The machine just doesn’t care.” So maybe a _care_ vs. _don’t care_ dimension, where our brains and the world look for purpose to apply hardware and computation to?\n\n(E) Riffing off of (D) maybe it’s about mind vs. machine? A mind driven by purpose trying to understand and control a machine that just executes computations? Then a possible answer to the initial question “Why is programming hard?” could perhaps be “because we are having a hard time encoding purpose into a system that has defined away any purpose”. Which also makes me suddenly realize that I have to re-think my stance on AI…\n\nJust thinking out loud here… maybe it inspires some new paths.",
