        "text": "An update on moving away from Slack.\n\nI've talked with a bunch of folks here and elsewhere, explored Zulip and Discourse hands-on, an looked around for other alternatives.\n\nThis has given me a renewed appreciation for Slack. The way we use it, it sits in a unique spot in the space, something between a forum and a chat.\n\n* The medium\/format of Slack, plus our cultural norms, encourage people to make substantial posts which then foster lively discussion. It feels like a forum.\n* Everyone see new posts instantaneously; heck, you even see typing indicators and online\/away status. It feels like a chat.\n* When looking at the top-level of a channel, you see the full content of each message, with a count of replies. It feels like… a blog index?\n\nThere's WYSIWYG text editing, unobtrusive persistence of drafts, polished clients for every platform. The information hierarchy is clear: channel -&gt; post -&gt; reply. Slack is, by and large, rather nice.\n\nSlack is also an enterprise-bootlicking product suffering from continual <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Enshittification|enshittification>. They're holding our history hostage. There are effectively zero moderation tools. User signup is flaky. The client is like an extravagant slice of cake — rich and thick to a fault. It's a service that runs over the internet, but it's not part of the web. It's not meaningfully extensible — there are \"bots\" and data exports, but they're basic and begrudging. It's siloed. It's proprietary. It's not the least bit malleable. Slack is antithetical to the ethos of this community. We champion the agency of individual people and wild experimentation. Slack, by design, opposes those.\n\nWith every alternative product I've explored, a few of these issues are addressed, but comparatively more of the nice qualities of Slack are absent.\n\nI use Discord all day every day. It's like Slack but slower (\"Installing updates 1 of 5\"), buggier, bloated with features and ads (\"Get Nitro\"). It also makes novel but awkward design choices. For instance, to start a thread of replies to a message, you must name the thread. That's a friction point. It allows some flexibility, in that you can start more than one thread for a single top-level post. But I'd argue that it is strictly worse than having a single linear thread (like Slack) or a single tree of replies (like a mailing list \/ forum). And besides, it's just as bad as Slack, or worse, in every way that presently pains us, except the boots being licked are gamer boots.\n\nThe organization behind Zulip is lovely. They're principled, self-sustaining without VC, focused on building a great product for their users. But, that product leans heavily into ephemeral chat, and suffers from a famously clunky user interface. Beyond just playing with the product, I spent some time in their Github (yay open source) looking at issues and discussions, and I don't see signs that they'll be able to fix the UI — it's hard for them to make even small styling changes, let alone restructure the information design.\n\nDiscourse is… fine. It's a little bit more chaotic, a little bit more clunky, a little bit more web-y, a little bit more bloated. It has way too much structure, with a visual hierarchy that doesn't map to the conceptual hierarchy. Like our Slack, it aims to be a hybrid of a forum and a chat, but it does that by offering both separately rather than synthesizing them into a compelling hybrid. If the community had started on Discourse, I think we'd be less unhappy with it than we are now with Slack, but I still think we'd be unhappy.\n\nBut the most charming alternative, and hands-down my favourite path forward… will take a bit of explaining.\n\nIt's the <https:\/\/forum.merveilles.town\/|Merveilles forum>. It's brutally simple. Spartan! But it's tasteful. It's immaculate. Crucially, a member of the Merveilles community built and maintains the forum software, taking a decidedly <https:\/\/cblgh.org\/cerca\/|principled> approach. This forum is a reflection of the community it homes, because it was built by and for that community. (See where I'm going with this?)\n\nAll the off-the-shelf options — Zulip, Discourse, Mattermost, Discord, IRC, phpBB, Mastodon — they'd let us _get away_ from Slack. We could pick one that had some nice features. It'd be a pain in the butt to move, and a blast of fresh air to settle in. But even if we self-hosted, we'd still be held hostage — by _product design decisions_. Every one of these products and services makes a set of tradeoffs to satisfy as many customers as possible. None of them expect their customers to be like us — champions of individual agency and wild experimentation.\n\nI believe the only way to move _up_ from Slack is to build our own thing. To take the Merveilles forum approach — be brutally simple, but tasteful. Figure out what core design decisions reflect our values; build some situated software just for ourselves. Design a final form that we'd like it to have, build the minimum viable version, and grow it from there slowly. Treat it like a collaborative project, accepting contributions from our members, but led by one or a few core people who are committed to putting in the work. Favour technical openness — open source, public data, protocols — so that anyone can hack on top.\n\nBuilding our own thing would be a stupid amount of work. Someone (maybe not always the same person) would need to continually invest time and energy. It'd more likely fizzle out and die than become a viable escape from Slack.\n\nBut if it does succeed, I think it'd be better for us than any of the other Slack alternatives.\n\nSo I propose we explore this option. Build it ourselves. If we manage to build something compelling, we move away from Slack onto that. If we don't, we stay on Slack, and wait for the situation to change further (either something better comes along, or Slack gets even worse and we _have to_ jump ship.)",

It's not meaningfully extensible — there are \"bots\" and data exports, but they're basic and begrudging. It's siloed. It's proprietary. It's not the least bit malleable. Slack is antithetical to the ethos of this community. We champion the agency of individual people and wild experimentation. Slack, by design, opposes those.\n\nWith every alternative product I've explored, a few of these issues are addressed, but comparatively more of the nice qualities of Slack are absent.\n\nI use Discord all day every day. It's like Slack but slower (\"Installing updates 1 of 5\"), buggier, bloated with features and ads (\"Get Nitro\"). It also makes novel but awkward design choices. For instance, to start a thread of replies to a message, you must name the thread. That's a friction point. It allows some flexibility, in that you can start more than one thread for a single top-level post. But I'd argue that it is strictly worse than having a single linear thread (like Slack) or a single tree of replies (like a mailing list \/ forum). And besides, it's just as bad as Slack, or worse, in every way that presently pains us, except the boots being licked are gamer boots.\n\nThe organization behind Zulip is lovely. They're principled, self-sustaining without VC, focused on building a great product for their users. But, that product leans heavily into ephemeral chat, and suffers from a famously clunky user interface. Beyond just playing with the product, I spent some time in their Github (yay open source) looking at issues and discussions, and I don't see signs that they'll be able to fix the UI — it's hard for them to make even small styling changes, let alone restructure the information design.\n\nDiscourse is… fine. It's a little bit more chaotic, a little bit more clunky, a little bit more web-y, a little bit more bloated. It has way too much structure, with a visual hierarchy that doesn't map to the conceptual hierarchy. Like our Slack, it aims to be a hybrid of a forum and a chat, but it does that by offering both separately rather than synthesizing them into a compelling hybrid. If the community had started on Discourse, I think we'd be less unhappy with it than we are now with Slack, but I still think we'd be unhappy.\n\nBut the most charming alternative, and hands-down my favourite path forward… will take a bit of explaining.\n\nIt's the "

Figure out what core design decisions reflect our values; build some situated software just for ourselves. Design a final form that we'd like it to have, build the minimum viable version, and grow it from there slowly. Treat it like a collaborative project, accepting contributions from our members, but led by one or a few core people who are committed to putting in the work. Favour technical openness — open source, public data, protocols — so that anyone can hack on top.\n\nBuilding our own thing would be a stupid amount of work. Someone (maybe not always the same person) would need to continually invest time and energy. It'd more likely fizzle out and die than become a viable escape from Slack.\n\nBut if it does succeed, I think it'd be better for us than any of the other Slack alternatives.\n\nSo I propose we explore this option. Build it ourselves. If we manage to build something compelling, we move away from Slack onto that.

I had a good experience with <https:\/\/github.com\/ivanreese\/2222|this game project > recently. Having seen what Mariano and Kartik did with slack history dumps, and how people write TUIs for basically any service with a decent API, I feel like a pragmatic, ruthlessly minimalist approach to system architecture might allow for a sort of ... um... \"marketplace\" ... of implementations for each of the pieces. (Sorry, threw up in my mouth a little.)\n\nLike, we wouldn't want the project's success to hinge on people coming out of the woodwork to fill the gaps. But rather, if someone wants to put their FoC money where their mouth is, they could rebuild part of the system in their own way and show how and why their FoC vision kicks ass.\n\nThis sort of opportunity for people to build stuff and demo it has been missing here. People build stuff, but it's all different kinds of stuff serving different purposes. That makes it hard for bystanders to understand and appreciate, or integrate with. Then there are things like TodoMVC, but they're soulless and vapid. (Sorry.. I really dislike TodoMVC for some reason. Need to unpack that. Anyone know a good group for commiserating about software?)\n\nIf we built a community hub as, like, a handful of nicely isolated pieces, each requiring a few hundred lines of JS to do a bare-bones MVP... I think people might play in that space.",
