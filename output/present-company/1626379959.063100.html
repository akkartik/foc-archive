Hey everyone,<br/>I lead the architecture and UX design for our product at <a href="http://story.ai">story.ai</a>, and we’re developing a text-oriented low-code platform in alpha-testing. We have two customers we’ve built bespoke automations for using our editor and runtime.<br/><br/><b>We would like to help you automate a task that is currently a pain in the butt that you might turn towards something like Zapier for.</b><br/><br/>Perhaps your current choice of services have a limitation you can’t get around, and you think it would be possible to fix with a more flexible tool. <b>We are open to building exactly the integrations you need, even if they are a bit obscure</b>.<br/><br/>Any help in this regard would be invaluable to validate use-cases for our current product. :heart:<br/><br/>I’m open to answering questions, and if you’re interested in us building you something, DM me :slightly_smiling_face:

This post might also be appropriate for #share-your-work or #of-end-user-programming, but I figured this is the channel for dumping “everything else” including stuff like job postings.
