I know of no other system trying to solve that problem. I'm not saying a better one couldn't be created but I think maybe people who think it's a simple problem because they use some other UI framework that makes them productive may not have actually considered the full problem being solved?\n\nJS has it's issues but if you just consider it a compiler target then you can ignore it the same way I generally ignore that all my other code is translated into x86.\n\nI know some people are looking forward to WebAssembly and hope to just render their own UIs as pixels on a canvas. I probably used to be one of those people having come from games but now I realize that having everything be in HTML enables so many other uses cases from ad blocking to translation plugins to password managers that don't need any cooperation from the sites themselves. Something what wouldn't work if everything was a custom solution drawn in pixels.\n\nI'm also not convinced yet that programming can be made all that much easier. I believe it can be made incrementally easier but I believe, at least at the moment, that it's just actually hard.\n\nAny non trivial piece of software has 1000s of decisions that need to be made and they aren't made easily and they form complex interactions. Solving all of them is just plain hard, not because programming is hard but because the problems themselves are hard. Maybe hard is the wrong word. There's lots of work to be done and I'm not yet convinced that work can be abstracted away into simple.\n\nIf all I want to do is make commercially viable competitive Todo App I still have 1000s of decisions to make. How large can a todo be? Are Todos just text or are they rich text? Can the user embed media? Pictures, Video? Audio? Documents? PDFs? How is this media stored? Do need to track storage so I can charge for it? How do I make sure people don't just use it as a dumping ground for file sharing? Do todos have revisions? Can I view the revisions? Do the media have revisions? Can I view each revision of media? Can Todos be shared? If I share it with someone can they share it with someone else? Can I revoke the sharing? Can they copy the Todo to their own Todo list? Do I need groups so I can auto share all my Todos with my co-workers but not with the general public? Do I need per group admin settings so some admin can set group policies? Can their be more than one admin? Can any admin add more admins or are there different kinds of responsibilities? Can todos be deleted permanently? Are there any legal responsibilities of todo deletion\/retention\/right-to-be-forgotten. Can you make your Todos publically viewable? Do todos have tags? Titles?

Can an admin reassign a set of todos to someone else (person leaves, their todos need to be give to others). Does a customer enquiry generate a Todo? Do todos have multiple levels of completion, person A claims it's done, person B verifies it's done.\n\nI doubt that's actually 1% of the things that need to be decided and implemented and I guess I don't yet see how to make that so simple anyone can do it easily.",

        "text": "In the Beads language we do not allow closures, as they create a weird hybrid of code + data that is not statically checkable. You will never be able to prove code correctness if you allow such weird dangling things. Closures although highly convenient for solving callbacks where you want to retain local data are quite evil, because looking at the code you cannot tell how many closures exist at any one point, thus creating great ambiguity in the code readers' minds. Closures were invented inside Actionscript 2 (which is the source material for JS, which was a direct, almost verbatim copy of AS2 at the time, including weird library quirks like the date function returning the day 1-based, but the month index 0-based. ). AS2 used closures all the time because otherwise it was super inconvenient for the AddEventListener callback functions, which inevitably need to reference some local variables telling the system where to put the data. Closures have been adopted so strongly by people like Crockford, that they program almost entirely in a meta-programming manner by generating a whole series of functions at the start of a program by customizing various functions. Makes it hard to debug unless your debugger can show the contextual variable values.",

You will never be able to prove code correctness if you allow such weird dangling things. Closures although highly convenient for solving callbacks where you want to retain local data are quite evil, because looking at the code you cannot tell how many closures exist at any one point, thus creating great ambiguity in the code readers' minds. Closures were invented inside Actionscript 2 (which is the source material for JS, which was a direct, almost verbatim copy of AS2 at the time, including weird library quirks like the date function returning the day 1-based, but the month index 0-based. ). AS2 used closures all the time because otherwise it was super inconvenient for the AddEventListener callback functions, which inevitably need to reference some local variables telling the system where to put the data. Closures have been adopted so strongly by people like Crockford, that they program almost entirely in a meta-programming manner by generating a whole series of functions at the start of a program by customizing various functions. Makes it hard to debug unless your debugger can show the contextual variable values."
