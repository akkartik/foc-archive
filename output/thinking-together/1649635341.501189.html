Has anyone heard of anyone trying to build end-user-modifiable apps with Electron? For those who are up for working in JS, it seems like you could have the same Electron app both run code and allow you to edit the code that's run in-app. Could even use VS Code's editor.

I mean, the project that birthed Electron — the Atom text editor — was designed to be modified by the user in a <em>bunch</em> of ways, depending on their technical ability and interest:<br/>• download plugins to add readymade behaviour<br/>• make new plugins by coding against the high-level APIs, or by directly manipulating the DOM<br/>• add custom keyboard shortcuts<br/>• add custom scripts (that can be run by shortcuts, or on events)<br/>• add custom CSS<br/>This might not seem so special, but today, <em>even after they worked to drastically narrow the extent to which you can mess with Atom's rendering (for the sake of perf)</em>, it's still wildly more customizable than other Electron-based apps, including VS Code.

That's cool to hear. More specifically, what I'm referring to (and these things tend to be hard to describe precisely) is an app where its code is available for modification within the running app while it's still running. It doesn't sound like you described Atom as working that way.
