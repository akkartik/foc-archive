The above link reminded me a lot of the <a href="https://interfaceingame.com">Interface In Game</a> gallery, which I believe has not been linked here before. Together, these two galleries are a fantastic resource for exploring various GUI <em>moods</em>.<br/><br/>HOWEVER â€” there's a big gap here, and it's especially striking for this Interface In Game link. You can't actually touch and use these interfaces yourself. So you don't get any sense of how they feel (and in many cases, how they animate, how they sound, etc).<br/><br/>On the other hand, that constraint might be a good thing. Rather than being confronted with something so visceral that you can't help but take it as a complete, singular thing, by only getting a visual of the GUI you have just the taste of it in your mouth. You have to (and <em>get</em> to) fill in that big gap with your imagination.

To my point, one of my favourite game GUIs is <a href="https://interfaceingame.com/games/death-stranding/">Death Stranding</a>. But just looking at screenshots, you don't really get any sense of what makes it so interesting.
