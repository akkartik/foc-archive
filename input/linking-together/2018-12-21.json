It forces me to switch back and forth rapidly between vastly separated areas, either with my eyes or with my eyes and mouse\/keyboard. It’s tricky or impossible to get a view of all the elements I am working with at the same time.\n\nWhen in “designer-mode” I often resort to diagramming (either paper or virtual). A diagram lets me position the elements the way I’m actually thinking about them, with closely related elements close to eachother and less-related elements farther apart. If an element has several closely related elements, it’s easy to draw them adjactent to eachother, whereas this wouldn’t be possible if they had to be in a flat list.\n\nIn an era of 3D virtual spaces and 3D printing, I find it ironic and aggravating that the typical programmer doesn’t even get a 2D, let alone 3D, view of their environment, but is still held down to 1D list-ual views! lol",

It forces me to switch back and forth rapidly between vastly separated areas, either with my eyes or with my eyes and mouse\/keyboard. It’s tricky or impossible to get a view of all the elements I am working with at the same time.\n\nWhen in “designer-mode” I often resort to diagramming (either paper or virtual). A diagram lets me position the elements the way I’m actually thinking about them, with closely related elements close to eachother and less-related elements farther apart. If an element has several closely related elements, it’s easy to draw them adjactent to eachother, whereas this wouldn’t be possible if they had to be in a flat list.\n\nIn an era of 3D virtual spaces and 3D printing, I find it ironic and aggravating that the typical programmer doesn’t even get a 2D, let alone 3D, view of their environment, but is still held down to 1D list-ual views! lol"

Something like that.\n\nIn this metaphor you could use the Z axis or tab for the history of a function, with keyboard shortcuts to say \"show me the entire layout at the current version of this card\" and \"undo that\". Might address the occlusion issue with 3D UIs.\n\nHaving lots of cards on screen may also help with the issue of hyperlinks you point out: clicking on one maybe only moves or pushes out one card, keeping the rest fairly stable visually. Does that seem helpful at all?",

Kinda like a cross between Prezi and this mockup tool a coworker of mine uses. InVision? Something like that.\n\nIn this metaphor you could use the Z axis or tab for the history of a function, with keyboard shortcuts to say \"show me the entire layout at the current version of this card\" and \"undo that\". Might address the occlusion issue with 3D UIs.\n\nHaving lots of cards on screen may also help with the issue of hyperlinks you point out: clicking on one maybe only moves or pushes out one card, keeping the rest fairly stable visually. Does that seem helpful at all?"
