Any fans of tiling window managers here? That's tiling window managers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager</a>) in contrast to stacking window managers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacking_window_manager">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacking_window_manager</a>). I've read a bunch from people who love using them around online. But I haven't found anyone who can convincingly describe why they prefer them. Most people talk about how they are easier to control from the keyboard, but that seems to stem from them being customizable, not from them tiling windows. I.e., what differentiates a tiling window manager is that for example if you have two windows next to each other, and you make one of them larger, it will simultaneously make the other one smaller. I'd love to hear from people who prefer tiling windows over stacking windows what they consider the advantages to be.

Hi Roben, I use a tiling window manager (i3). The main thing I like is that default is to make everything visible on a workspace and use up all the available space. Consider the stacking window manager screenshot above where the file manger and minesweeper obscures the program manager. Further there are large chunks of spaces just left unused. If you often use 'adjustable aspect ratio' apps (e.g. terminals, editors browsers etc. work at different aspect ratios and sizes, maybe not minesweeper or clock), then filling up the screen and making all information visible is great. It doesn't matter if there's a shortcut in stacking WMs to snap to left-50% or right-50%. In i3, if I launch two terminal windows they're already snapped left and right taking 50% space each by default, no other shortcuts required. The automatic tiling is the main thing I like.

Great summary, thank you! Summarizing everything, it seems the advantage is keeping everything visible automatically, and in specific, it's less keyboard shortcuts to keep make new windows and keep them visible than with a stacking window manager.
