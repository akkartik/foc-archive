:wave:  Hello! Was just recommended this channel by another member who highly recommended it and I thought it was cool.<br/><br/>I'm a software engineer who recently co-founded a product called Merit (<a href="https://www.get-merit.com/">https://www.get-merit.com/</a>) which connects folks in software teams to senior leaders to grow their craft and career. Before that I built a diversity recruiting platform called Jopwell and led engineering as the CTO.<br/><br/>We use NodeJS, Mongo, and React at Merit, which switches between feeling super hacky :see_no_evil: and super effective :smile: . I'm excited to be in this slack group and learning from folks here!
