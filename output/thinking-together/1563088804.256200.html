I'm starting to doubt that named/non-positional params + first-class functions would even be a real problem, since in many cases where you're passing functions as arguments they need to be bespoke anyway and so the "wiring" of names comes for free as you're defining them. Agree or disagree? How often does one pass a premade library function as an argument? It's hard for me to predict how often this would come up without writing real code under this constraint. I wonder if there's some way to measure this in real code bases.
