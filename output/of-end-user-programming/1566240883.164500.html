If there was a change I would make to the term it would be to drop "end-user". In the world I want to aim for there's no sharp difference between programmers and end-users. It's just a continuous spectrum of different people having different interests. X may take a little more time to make a change than Y, but there wouldn't be a stark binary distinction between experts and non-experts.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the current term benefits from being rooted in the world we have rather than the one we want. So the name is mostly fine.
