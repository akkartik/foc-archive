:wave: Hey there, I’m Justin. I found Future of Coding accidentally when I was searching for something from <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span>. I have <em>so many</em> hours of podcasts to catch up on now, and it looks like there’s a ton of interesting content here too!<br/><br/>I’ve long thought (like so many others here I’m sure) that programming (and software development in general) should be easier, and that’s probably why I joined Zapier a little over eight years ago. :smile: I think we’ve done a pretty good job taking what once was a pretty difficult task of integrating multiple APIs and made it approachable for normal folks. But I’ve always had an itch that we should know more about which programming concepts are easier and which ones are more difficult. Especially since we’ve become more like a programming language over time, by adding things like branching, looping, and functions.<br/><br/>So this year, I was lucky enough to take a break from my job as engineer/architect and spend most of my time researching end-user development. The business goal is ultimately to make Zapier easier to use, either by learning how to improve our core product or add on other products. But I’m also personally interested in trying to make a small dent in this space.
