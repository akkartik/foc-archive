&gt; Clearly this OOP/Message passing hybrid was a complete dead end.<br/>Not at all. Self introduced the idea of object oriented programming using prototypes and delegation, instead of classes, and it was highly influential. Prototype-based OOP was the basis for Javascript and Lua. Javascript is the world's most popular language, and Lua is also highly successful. The JIT compilation techniques and the generational garbage collector pioneered by Self are the basis for modern Javascript implementations. The 1987 Self paper by Dave Ungar and Randall Smith was selected as one of the three most influential OOPSLA papers presented between 1986 and 1996.
