By default, cells snap into each other like a block-based editor, but can be pulled apart, revealing a wire when more space is necessary or flow is better demonstrated. Cells usually contain textual “formulas,” which preserves the density of text and makes it easy to edit complex expressions with few actions.

Splitting control out vertically, allows you to quickly “read the spine” and get the main idea of what’s going to happen.\n• With the connected cells, we get the structure of block-based editors and can make it clear where actions can be performed. This also enables a primarily locate and act flow.\n• Rather than pure text, we can progressively disclose the internals of the cells, including showing slots only when they’re part of the flow",

These node assemblies are all about the micro flow, but how you view\/navigate\/locate\/act on the whole system is something else entirely. It actually has a lot of parallels with micro\/macro in RTS games."
