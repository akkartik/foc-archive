Hello, friends! My name is Mark, and I've been vaguely noodling on the future of building webapps for the past few months. I am delighted to have discovered this community! I'm a frontend developer by trade. I currently work as an engineer in residence at a VC firm, kicking the proverbial tires on new tech platforms and frameworks. Previously, I was an early engineer at Slack and, in the ever-receding distance of my memory, at Twitter as well.
