They had built the industry-leading notation package and were fired en masse. They started the blank page redesign as the leading experts in the field already. The workflow and mental model they developed with an opportunity to start over are different enough that it's difficult to interoperate either as a user or from a document\/file format POV that it's hard to imagine it working in a document-centric world without a huge loss of fidelity (and it's interesting to me that Raskin specifically calls out music notation as a great use case for that vision)",

They had built the industry-leading notation package and were fired en masse. They started the blank page redesign as the leading experts in the field already. The workflow and mental model they developed with an opportunity to start over are different enough that it's difficult to interoperate either as a user or from a document\/file format POV that it's hard to imagine it working in a document-centric world without a huge loss of fidelity (and it's interesting to me that Raskin specifically calls out music notation as a great use case for that vision)"
