Hiya. I'm an entrepreneur partner of Ville's and the chief architect of ValOS base infrastructure. I'm more than happy to share deeper technicalities of the stack, but glad to leave Ville do most of the talking.<br/>I'm a generalist and a systems builder (with all the good and the bad that comes with it), and for me ValOS is an 'exercise' of pushing the envelope of 'Distributed CRUD Event Sourcing' on several fronts as a basis of interactive content sharing and execution environment. The vision crystallized already back in late 2016 and we were able to bootstrap our own IDE 'Zero' for developing itself in late 2017 - this is the point were it ceased to be an exercise but a real thing. While the design has always centered around the base technologies of JS, HTML5 and CSS (and always will be!), the underlying paradigm is quite different. This has meant having to reinvent more wheels than we'd like. But we're on the doorsteps of having a fully functional development ecosystem with all the necessary components in place. So even I am sticking my neck out and not have Ville do all the networking... :stuck_out_tongue:
