Hey folks, I'm Jasim and for a long time I thought that programming was just expressions, mutation, loops, and i/o - and you had it all. "Give me a Turing machine and I shall move mountains" or something like that.<br/><br/>But one day I had enough - a Javascript framework I used at work was not performant, yet I couldn't dig down because its abstractions were opaque and non-programmable. And it was making it difficult to do my job, causing real stress. But I couldn't put my hands on what was actually wrong. Was it my lack of understanding, or had it to do with the tool itself? To get to its root I had to understand programming at a meta-level and that rabbit hole took me into CTM by Peter Van Roy, who describes it thus:<br/><br/>&gt; We define programming, as a general human activity, to mean the act of extending or changing a system's functionality. Programming is a widespread activity that is done both by nonspecialists (eg: consumers who change the settings of their alarm clock or cellular phone) and specialists (computer programmers, the audience for this book).<br/><br/>I see the <em>future of programming</em> as this infinite game were things that previously needed specialists keep moving into non-specialist territory, yet the field keeps growing and constantly keeps giving birth to new specialisations.<br/><br/>And I'm working on a product at a distant proximity to this: a tool for UI designers that makes their designs live by providing clean &amp; precise HTML and CSS as they design. It is called Protoship Codegen and is at <a href="https://protoship.io">https://protoship.io</a>.<br/><br/>I tweet at <a href="http://twitter.com/jasim_ab">twitter.com/jasim_ab</a>, where I mostly advocate for the mainstreaming of Typed Functional Programming, am a regular listener of the podcast, and am excited to meet you all!

I really like that framing, where you have us "future of coding" people trailing the state of the art / bare metal, into infinity

Very cool product! Is it a machine learning thing? I'd be curious to hear how you'd compare/contrast it with Webflow

Hey Steve, Future Of Coding is the kind of podcast I wished existed a long time ago, and it is even better to find a warm community around it. Thanks!<br/><br/>We do ML (ReasonML), but not Machine Learning :slightly_smiling_face: Two reasons:<br/>1) we learned the hard way that heuristics makes the product unusable. If the results are not predictable, users have a hard time building habits around it. We want a 1:1 cause/effect relationship between the design and the output.<br/><br/>2) many attempts in this space treat ML as a blackbox - take an entire design and feed it into an algorithm and hope for good results. We're generating code that can be put in use for building complex web applications, not just websites. This means the generated code should aspire to be as perfect as possible, and programmers should be able to grok it immediately. There are areas were ML will be useful in a fine-grained manner; a scalpel than a hammer, but at the moment we're able to produce great results with a good old fashioned expert system.

Webflow helps designers design directly on the web (huge fan of the product and the team), but it starts at content-centric websites (landing pages etc.) and is moving towards specialized applications with CMS and E-Commerce. We're for the cases where UI designers design complex web applications and they need to put them into production by integrating into their production codebase.

I agree with Steve, I really like your framing. It's probably applicable to the progression of technology in general: the democratisation of complexity/new abilities/...

Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andrew Reece</span>. I think in programming lingo we think of this as increasing the level of abstraction, but I like the people-centric aspect of that definition. I think I picked it up from an a16z podcast where the guest defined the success of their software in how it affects actual job descriptions of people, thus having a tangible effect on their actual lives.

The lens of considering the effect on people (vs a tech-first approach) was one of the big takeaways from my ergonomics/human factors course. It's surprising how unintuitive it is for many/most/all(?) designers! (That's not intended as a pejorative btw, more a musing on the human condition.)<br/><br/>I've started to flesh out some of my thoughts on what we often call 'levels of abstraction' in the last few posts in #thinking-together - re its subcategories and the distinction between 'more' and 'better' abstraction - so I'll avoid repeating myself here :stuck_out_tongue: .<br/>(also, sorry, I assume that 'a16z' is an abbreviation like 'i18n', but I don't know what it stands for..?)

That's great, I'll comb through #thinking-together. Sorry about the acronym, it stands for Andressen-Horowitz. They were big backers of Eve (<a href="http://witheve.com">witheve.com</a>) and have an investor's interest in the future of programming.

Ah cool, thanks for elaborating! I wasn't aware of their podcast. That sounds like another useful lens to add to the collection.
