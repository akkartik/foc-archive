I had a lovely call with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> a few weeks ago, and he was kind enough to let me record it and release it as the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/new-physics-with-99281699">patreon bonus podcast episode</a> this month. We'd been DMing about <a href="../thinking-together/1704143837.966519.html">this post</a>, keen to exchange our thoughts on a (new?) subtle kind of idea: those that can only be expressed (or received) by designing (or playing with) an interactive system. For instance, there's a subjective experience of interacting with a system, and I posit that this feeling engenders a kind of meaningful thought. So we set out to talk about this, and of course about some related things too (such as "the new physics" that exist inside the computer). Lots of fun. Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> for the chat, and for letting me share it as <em>boco</em>. And thanks to all of you who support our effort to make the best, weirdest, most interesting podcast we can. Look forward to the next main episodeâ€¦ with a real <em>subjective experience</em> of soon-ness!
