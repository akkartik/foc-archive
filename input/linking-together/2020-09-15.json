I find it always interesting how many different ways to seemingly similar topics exist. So in one way it encourages me that I see more and more people resonating with the vision of a decentralised information architecture. On the other hand it also seems a bit strange (at least to me) when a single person comes to great lengths and depths without collaboration (that is without active collaboration) from other people. \nI think there are many such attempts and many failed but. some succeeded to a certain degree. For me personally the most interesting effort with certainly a lot of traction already is web3. <https:\/\/youtu.be\/l44z35vabvA|https:\/\/youtu.be\/l44z35vabvA>\nI hope to see lots of interesting experiments in that space. I would love to see some form of collaboration between infocentral and other FoC single person efforts in a more direct manner. It seems to me that everyone can think up the brightest future scenarios but oh god beware if contact to other human beings with different opinions is needed in the processes of creating something better for the future :sweat_smile: so I’m looking forward in engaging in discussion on how things could further proceed from here. There is so much room for improvement:)",
