For those that are intrigued by <a href="https://gtoolkit.com">Glamorous Toolkit</a>, perhaps the following talk can be interesting:<br/><br/>Wednesday, April 24, 8pm CET<br/>UK Smalltalk User Group<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">What exactly is Glamorous Toolkit?<br/><br/>To some people Glamorous Toolkit is a Pharo environment. To others it's a knowledge management system. Others might see a code analysis platform, a data visualization or an API browsing tool. Yet others see the graphical stack with its interactive editors. Glamorous Toolkit is all of these. But it's really also none of these. These are merely examples of the many forms the environment can be molded to. And there can be many more. Glamorous Toolkit is primarily an environment that makes it possible to create many experiences seamlessly and contextually. This then leads to a new way of programming that we call Moldable Development.</pre><br/>Join remotely here: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ukstug/events/300575234/">https://www.meetup.com/ukstug/events/300575234/</a>
