'Relations' map more consistently between human concepts and computer implementation, are simpler (and so are easier to debug), and typically faster to do computations with.\n2) Relatedly, it's generally a good idea to lay out data similar to a normalized relational database - this kept making me think of Eve (<@UEBG0NPDK> were you at all aware of\/influenced by the DOD 'movement'\/approach?)\n3) 'Existence-based' programming (see the chapter of a similar name) reduces a lot of boilerplate noise and eliminates-by-design the possibility of a few classes of errors\n4) A mixture of queues and hook\/subscription\/reactions slot in nicely with the paradigm. This leads to easy concurrency with effective immutability without the mental and CPU overhead of mutexes.",

'Relations' map more consistently between human concepts and computer implementation, are simpler (and so are easier to debug), and typically faster to do computations with.\n2) Relatedly, it's generally a good idea to lay out data similar to a normalized relational database - this kept making me think of Eve ("

I'm sure systems exist to make things look more like the former but under the hood act like the latter. In fact [Unity's Entity Component System](<https:\/\/unity.com\/unity\/features\/job-system-ECS>) is one such system.\n\nBut usage is still far more involved than the more obvious method.\n\nIf I'm not making sense what I'm trying to say is that organizing around perf is mostly a topic for experienced programmers.\n\nAnother maybe good example is three.js, it started with Vertex objects, each object holding 3 values. You'd make arrays of them then make Face objects and add Vertex objects to do those to make polygons. That's arguably the most obvious idea and when three.js was mostly a software renderer it worked.\n\nBut then as they added WebGL they ran into the issue that the GPU needs the data all laid out in nice parallel arrays so they have this issue where they currently have 2 paths.\n\nPath 1, the old path, Use Vertex and Face, and then the library has to convert to a GPU friendly format anytime data is changed.\n\nPath 2, build GPU friendly formats directly, no intermediate format.\n\nThe problem with Path 2 is for inexperienced programmers they have to deal with data as individual numbers in an array. In other words, to a specific vertex in path 1 could be as simple as\n\n```\nconst vertex = vertices[vertexIndex];  \/\/ easy\n```\n\nwhere as the GPU friendly way is more like\n\n```\nconst offset = vertexIndex * stride;\nconst x = vertices[offset + 0];\nconst y = vertices[offset + 1];\nconst z = vertices[offset + 2];\nconst vertex = new Vertex(x, y, z); \/\/ because you want access to vertex methods these 3 values need to be assign a type.\n```\n\nThat looks trivial to an experienced programmer but not to a beginner.\n\nAnyway, there are probably ways to solve that type of issue and give both perf and easy to follow code for a beginner but I haven't seen any.",
