Heya all,<br/><br/>Just found this community through weird youtube->todepond->twitter->ink&switch swirl of events. I am Piotr generally electronic/software engineer (I guess this would be computer engineer) extremely interested in building experimental software and tools. I spend a lot of my time delving into Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence topics, which you can see on my github: <a href="https://github.com/PeterWaIIace">https://github.com/PeterWaIIace</a><br/><br/>However, I came here to share my largest project so far called <b>EyeGestures</b>. It is <b>python</b> (for now) <b>library</b> enabling engineers to build gaze-driven interfaces just by using built-in webcam (so you can make your own gaze tracker or eye tracker in seconds now - no need for expensive hardware nor license!). No servers required, everything runs locally: <a href="https://github.com/NativeSensors/EyeGestures">https://github.com/NativeSensors/EyeGestures</a><br/><br/>Hope you will enjoy, and look forward to chat with you all!
