Hi, this week a text-only update : the goal I had this week was to implement a more real-life use-case and use that to improve and extend the editor. What better in this covid-19 period then a small dashboard to show world-wide covid-19 statistics using a countries dropdown and sub selection by province if there are any,  and show that in a chart. I use <a href="http://api.covid19api.com">api.covid19api.com</a> to retrieve the data. I added some tasks/node-types to filter/sort/group/select the data that is being retrieved. Since the flowrunner that I build is payload based, it’s all about manipulating/adding properties to the payload each node receives using these new tasks. The payload is a simple javascript object in the web-playground implementation of the editor.<br/>The output is shown in a chart using a chart node that uses the echarts npm package and it is also configured by adding the full json configuration to the payload and filling the data based on the input payload.<br/>Functionality of this “covid-19 dashboard” is still limited, but I will extend the current flow with more functionalities like selecting start and enddates. You can see the current flow in the image.

This is the ui-view of the flow without all the nodes that manipulate the incoming data/payloads :

My example might seem simple from the outset, although it is still simple if you would compare it with real real-life use-cases, but it surfaces some issues. When I choose US as country, no data is shown or only after quite a long time. The reason for this is that the flowrunner currently reruns the flow each time you choose a value in that dropdown or other form-controls. When not a lot of processing is needed, you dont notice the problem this causes. But because US has a lot of data, it is very much noticable : network calls are being rerun and a lot of data needs to be processed. The network calls itself also takes some time offcourse, which in this case I got litte control over. I am going to work on a solution to solve the problems on the flowrunner side. An idea is to be able to rerun a single node in a flow with its last payload that it received from an input-node.
