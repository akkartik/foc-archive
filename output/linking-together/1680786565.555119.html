The last couple podcasts connecting with <em>programmer</em> productivity reminded me of this article trying to trace software's impact — or not — on overall productivity. It's main claim is that software, so far,  has not had the expected impact on overall productivity, and that the challenge is that it is <em>hard</em> and <em>expensive</em> to model the real world within the constraints of programming. (Maybe you read it differently!) It seems to me that this is one big challenge with end-user programming, too: many people don't want to think beforehand about all the exceptions to a rule that happen in real life, since real life allows you to address those exceptions on-the-fly.<br/><br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221206161753/https://austinvernon.eth.link/blog/softwareisprocess.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20221206161753/https://austinver&hellip;</a>

Oh geez. That's a good explanation for why we haven't see ever-increasing productivity despite all of the investment on in software. For individuals and small teams, computers aren't much better than analog tech like in-person discussions or pencil and paper. I feel that in a lot of things I use computers for. So often, I'd rather do it on paper than deal with the upkeep of the hardware and software to do it.

Just today I was helping my wife with a computer issue. It took one hour and I don't think I fully solved it. There is an issue several times per week that she interrupts my work for me to solve. Companies can afford IT departments. To maintain a small fleet of household computers, I play that role. These are the kinds of costs that only are recouped in large organizations.

On the other hand, I think there are some industries/verticals that have been beneficiaries of huge productivity gains. I once was talking to an architect at a party. He was saying that before the industry was computerized, most of their time was spent erasing lines on blueprints. There was a suite of tools and tacit knowledge about how to remove lines without destroying the paper. Computerization meant they could edit the digital copy and print out a new one, at the cost of a much poorer user interface (mouse and keyboard vs pencil and t-square) for the initial draft.

Of course, things like that are a one-time win. They don't compound.
