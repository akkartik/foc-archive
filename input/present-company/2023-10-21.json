After more or less failing my undergrad degree and 10 years of work as a software engineer (which I did mostly really enjoy) I managed to transition into research where my personal projects around live coding became my job. I got on a part time masters in arts computing (industrial experience standing in for my poor undergrad degree) and then a full time studentship to do a research degree. I became a father at the same time as starting the research degree, the flexible working and on site nursery worked out well.  Being a student was amazing but postdoc university life a bit less great in terms of having time to do research. Now I'm still doing full time fundamental research but outside of university, as part of a non profit research studio. \nDespite the freedom lately I've felt a bit lost and unproductive. I guess it's not just about finding the time but also the energy and direction when you're doing self directed work. I've just started a bullet journal which I hope will introduce more intentionality to my work. I'd be happy to hear of others' experiences with that sort of thing!\nMore generally I think a four day week is a good idea for all involved.",
