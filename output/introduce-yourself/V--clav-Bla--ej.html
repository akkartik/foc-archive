Hello, I'm Vašek. I work in academia (theoretical informatics). Searching for some programming podcasts today I stumbled upon FoC and I was quite impressed. I listened to 4 of the podcasts, the last was the 46 Community Survey. I found myself crying at the end as the answers in "What does 'Future of Coding' mean?" resonated well with me. I hope to become part of this community by overcoming my introverted nature and realize moonshot dreams about the future.
