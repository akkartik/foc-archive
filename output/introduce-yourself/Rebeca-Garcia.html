Hola all :wave:,<br/><br/>I’m Rebeca, from Spain but living in the UK for quite some time now. My background is in business and marketing, I can only do some SQL and python from my time as a finance analyst but I’m learning and sharing my journey on Tiktok.<br/><br/>I’m also CEO of Cubode, which I founded with my brother and we’ve been working on it for the past two years or so. It’s a no-code platform to teach how to code, so users can learn while building. I’m very interested in all things education and intrigued to know more about this community.<br/><br/>I found Bret’s video on the future of programming and it brought me here, nice to meet you all.  :pray:
