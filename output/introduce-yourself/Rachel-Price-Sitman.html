hi i'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-price1/">rachel</a>! i'm not a software engineer but i've worked closely with developers for the past 8+ years and i've always wanted to build my own app... now, with generative AI, i've been able to start an iOS app from scratch without much coding experience.. it isn't perfect and an iOS engineer would do a much better job, but I am finding it really exciting what AI can do in terms of lowering technical barriers and getting non engineers involved in code. specifically interested in LLMs / tools / techniques that can help you build products and generate working code. reach out if you have any tips or suggestions!
