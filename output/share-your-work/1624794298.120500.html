Hi,<br/><br/>I’ve decided to step out of my comfort zone and share with you a codesandbox which has the flowrunner-canvas editor embedded. This is the side project I have been working on the last couple of years and shown some video’s of it here. And to manage expectations: this is a small part of what is possible already, and only a very small amount of node-types have been made available when using the editor this way. Also expect some bugs ;-) The editor is responsive but support for touch screens can and will be improved in the future.<br/>But hopefully it gives enough impressions on some of the core ideas of the project.<br/><br/>The flow that is loaded when opening the codesandbox, has a form-node with radio-buttons, when you choose the top most radiobutton, two input fields will appear. The values you enter in those input fields are multiplied together by the expression-node and the output is shown in the debug-node. <br/><br/>All nodes manipulate the payload (a basic javascript object), which is passed through to the next output. The results are visible in realtime as well as the execution path the flow follows.<br/><br/>In this example, localstorage is used for storing the flow (it is initialised with an example automatically). But this doesn’t work in incognito mode, please be aware of that if you want to try it out like that.<br/><br/><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/flowrunner-canvas-wljy9">https://codesandbox.io/s/flowrunner-canvas-wljy9</a><br/><br/>Feedback is very welcome! :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks!

An additional example : <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/flowrunner-canvas-wasm-example-p68pz">https://codesandbox.io/s/flowrunner-canvas-wasm-example-p68pz</a> .. you have to play around with the sliders to get some result. The "script" in the ScriptTask-node gets compiled to webassembly in real-time. The sliders are input-parameters to this webassembly module, and the output is shown in the node on the right-hand side.

Kudos for taking the step out of your comfort zone. I'm excited to play with this when I get back to my computer. What sort of feedback would be most helpful at this stage? I'd hate to over-index on the wrong area.

Yeah, thats a good question actually. I now that the UI definitely needs work (nodes are not yet auto connected for example when dragging them on stage). I'll give it some thought today on what areas I actually want feedback
