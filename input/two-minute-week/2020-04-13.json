That takes a huge time investment.\n\nSmall challenges, what I'm working on now:\n• I need new way to organize objects in the scene that allows nesting\/grouping, and allows for function composition.\n• I need to decide on a visual metaphor for the idea of things being _ordered_. For instance, to allow positional arguments to functions, or building ordered lists.\n• The current prototype is a fork of an unfinished fork of a mostly-working previous prototype, so there's a lot of half-implemented ideas I either need to remove or finish.
