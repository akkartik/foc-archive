That's an interesting discussion! I'd be neat if more people would collaborate on documentation, and as <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> pointed out, novices to a project are especially important as collaborators.<br/>I wonder if more people would edit documentation if it wasn't owned by the project's owner. Think about having wikipedia-like editing right within your documentation. Especially if I'm new to a project, I'm always afraid to screw up other people's documentation by writing something stupid. I wonder if knowing that the next regular guy who reads my changes could easily improve or correct them would lower the bar to start collaborating.<br/>Another option could be to include comments into each documentation page. People are used to providing feedback if they can, so they would probably point out a lot of issues that could then be used by maintainers to improve documentation.<br/>Using current tools (IRC, github issues / PRs) all of this is possible already, but I think that making it easier and integrating it better into the documentation itself could make a huge difference.
