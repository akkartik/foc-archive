<span style="background-color:#ccf">@magicmouse94937</span> I want to expand a little bit more on the issue of "twitter and facebook" being successful. I think people use technology as a means of self expression. And people have done this using these platforms for some time. But obviously issues arise  or changes comes to play, since "the medium is the massage" and people are becoming more and more dissatisfied with the current state of these. Twitter for example has changed a lot in the last 10 years. These days it feels like that are more bots and less humane interactions on twitter possible than before. Reasons for that are complex but exaclty because of that I do not believe that a single/centralized company can resolve these issues, that is impossible. Again I think these "social networks" will gravitate towards open dialog protocols.
