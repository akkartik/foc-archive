I am back with Wasp weekly updates! I will try to do them every week from now on, as a sort of accountability mechanism. This one covers last couple of weeks:<br/>- Added support for newest, production-ready version of Prisma.<br/>- Added support for .env file.<br/>- PostgreSQL can now be used during development.<br/>- Moved CI from Travis &amp; Appveyor to Github Actions -&gt; it is faster, simpler and free.<br/>Plan for this week:<br/>- Looking into automatic CHANGELOG generation -&gt; still figuring out how to set it up. <a href="http://conventionalcommits.org">conventionalcommits.org</a> seems like the way to go.<br/>- Implement note taking app in Wasp as a case study.<br/>- Write and publish a blog post.
