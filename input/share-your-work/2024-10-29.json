I was suggesting game engines can be useful for doing what you're doing.\n\nI don't know if you have been following my posts, but I've basically been programming exclusively in a game engine since about early 2022.\n\nThere's also a whole genre of Youtube educational videos that are piggy-backing off of game engines like Unity.

The largest FOAM app is 315k lines, so it scales well. It never did get used for real CAD sims. It was only a one-week project to develop the original FLOW and then another week to add the 2D and 3D turtle graphics. We pitched expanding on the CAD simulation project but it wasn't approved. Here's a bit more on the underlying framework (at least the reactive part): "
