As a follow-up to the above, there's this nice blog post from <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nikita Prokopov</span> on <em>diagrams as code:</em> <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/diagrams/">Where Should Visual Programming Go?</a><br/><br/>&gt; Level 3: Diagrams are code<br/>&gt; This is what the endgame should be IMO. Some things are better represented as text. Some are best understood visually. We should mix and match what works best on a case-by-case basis. Don’t try to visualize simple code. Don’t try to write code where a diagram is better.<br/>Hear, hear!

&gt; Think of it as a game engine like Godot or Unity. In them, you can write normal text code, but you can also create and edit scenes. These scenes are stored in their own files, have specialized editors that know how to edit them, and have no code representation. Because why? The visual way <em>in this particular case</em> is better.

“Level 3”, when it’s not code & diagram as universal parallel representations but domain-specific <em>visual syntaxes</em> (as <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nikita Prokopov</span> says he wants) has been explored a number of times. Here is the relevant section from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06777">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06777</a>, with some hopefully helpful citations.

Yeah this is basically notebook programming. There are two levels to what you want to diagram too. 1. the program specification (e.g. the source or configuration) or 2. The runtime state. Text source code is just a narrow view of 1. I think that can be enhanced with diagrams across for both 1 and 2. <a href="https://observablehq.com/plot/">https://observablehq.com/plot/</a> is incredibly flexible for quite a huge range of visualizations (grammar of graphics). I use it for schematic like diagrams, but obviously it also does more recognisable mathy charts too.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tom Larkworthy</span> This isn’t “basically notebook programming” if that’s taken in the sense of notebook programming today, right? Notebooks today can’t use graphics to define part of a program, only to visualize data. Here’s another screenshot from my paper I linked above.

notebooks are definitely capable of reading external data and making dynamic, executable decisions based on it. The also have a ton of affordances for representing data visually, and for implementing UIs inline. So together all those things seem like level 3 to me, but some assembly is required. The browser itself has <a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/local-storage-view">local storage </a>and the env has internet access so I think persistence is a red herring if you consider the system as a whole.

What <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nikita Prokopov</span> is arguing for in level 3, and what <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Joshua Horowitz</span> seems to be referring to, is the desire for such tools that <em>don't</em> require "some assembly". The amount of assembly needed to go from notebook to programming-with-diagrams is about the same amount of assembly to go from smalltalk to programming-with-diagrams or the web platform to programming-with-diagrams. So while notebooks certainly are nice environments to work in, and while it would be nice if notebooks offered p-w-d out of the box, I don't think it's true that "this is basically notebook programming", unless it's also true that this is basically smalltalk or basically javascript.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tom Larkworthy</span>: Notebooks are great at displaying runtime state. You can also use them to render UIs, with which you can modify transient state. But the persistent code that makes up a notebook can only be edited through the notebook’s code editor. If I want to edit a state chart graphically and have that be part of the code my notebook runs, I can’t do that with Observable or Jupyter or whatever without very awkward workflows (like copy-pasting text from an Observable output cell into a code cell). Interactions with graphical things rendered in a notebook don’t survive a browser refresh. So they do not pull off the <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nikita Prokopov</span> level-3 thing.

I roughly agree with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span>’s response, except that notebooks do have a slight advantage – if I’m ok editing a “diagrammatic program” through textual data, then I can do that in Observable, and also have Observable visualize the “diagrammatic program”, live, in the place where I’m editing it. Doing that in a trad dev environment would make it harder to see that visualization.<br/><br/>My issue is that I don’t want to edit a diagrammatic program through textual data – I wanna edit it through a diagram!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> That website is an interesting case, because there we’re not talking about a program-authoring environment being live and/or rich; we’re talking about a (one-off) program-reading environment being live and/or rich. I agree that it’s kinda live! (Wish it had a more fine-grained liveness tho – like don’t you want to see the relativeLuminance values, not just the final output?) As a test rig of the code, it’s kinda rich, in that you’re editing the test inputs with a direct-manipulation editor… but it feels weird to call that rich, cuz we’re not editing the <em>program</em> in a rich way, just some test inputs. But I see where you’re coming from.

observable views are a UI + a data-channel and they can be 2-way bound to other UI components, composed <a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/view">hierarchically</a>, or <b>even bound to persistence [<a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/local-storage-view">local</a> view, <a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/shareview">shared</a> view]</b>.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tom Larkworthy</span> The only part of your comment which is relevant to what I’m talking about is the part about local/shared persistence. I appreciate the effort you’ve put into getting around Observable’s lack of support for this stuff! But those approaches are limited and awkward:<br/><br/>• If we’re talking about using UI to edit your notebook’s code, local persistence is a non-starter… the point of notebooks is to share code.<br/>• The shared view has no authentication. So if you used it to author part of the notebook’s code, anyone with access to the notebook would be able to modify it’s code. If you added authentication, you would then have two separate, parallel auth systems to keep synchronized — one for Observable &amp; one for your sharing system.<br/>• In both local + shared situations, you have to add IDs by hand whenever you want to persist something. If you clone a cell, it keeps the same ID, so it edits the same underlying (local or cloud) state. You gotta remember to change them or you’ll clobber stuff. Same for cloning / forking notebooks.<br/>In short, I think these approaches all get very awkward, arguably no less awkward than copy-pasting code into cells. I’d be curious to hear whether you’ve heard of them being used successfully in practice, in the face of these problems.<br/><br/>Personally, I’d like it if Observable could add persistent UI-editable state, so we wouldn’t have to make up work-arounds. But I don’t see that happening, given that the company is no longer focusing on the notebook product. Perhaps some other notebook product could get in the game, maybe something open-source?

There is a bit of a complexity/performance ceiling, but I would say that is true of Jupyter and Excel too, it doesn't stop them being incredibly useful internal micro-apps.<br/>There are several open source Observable-likes in existence already<br/>• <a href="https://github.com/asg017/dataflow">https://github.com/asg017/dataflow</a><br/>• <a href="https://starboard.gg/">https://starboard.gg/</a><br/>Building something that is good enough IDE/Visual Env/Ecosystem is basically too large a project to pull off. Even Observable hasn't really pulled it off! I don't think saving the state of the notebook is <em>the</em> problem.

Level 3 is straight-forward (and “easy”) with currently-available technologies:<br/>1. use diagram editors that save diagrams in some kind of XML or JSON format (I use <a href="http://draw.io">draw.io</a>, I use Kinopio, I’ve used yEd in the past), then, use XML parsing libraries or OhmJS to inhale the info<br/>2. isolate software components from one another - make each unit of software be completely stand-alone - meaning data <b>and</b> control flow - [hint: closures, queues, avoid function-calling for inter-component communication (level-3 innovation is discouraged by function-calling-think (in fact, at one point, I used mostly Prolog for thinking along with Javascript and Bash and Lisp for clean-up))]<br/>3. think of current GPLs - Haskell, Python, Javascript, Rust, Lisp - as just <b>assembly</b> languages for level 3.<br/>(aside: meaning of “easy” == Zac Nowicki of Kagi created a <a href="http://draw.io">draw.io</a>+Odin based Level 3 DPL for me in less than a week)

ok, interesting, just a prototype but if you click on the plot it adds a point there. The nice thing is that you can work in the coordinate space of the diagram, not pixels or viewport. Maybe plot can be an input :thinking_face:<br/><a href="https://observablehq.com/d/e627aaaaa9857257">https://observablehq.com/d/e627aaaaa9857257</a>

FWIW I tend to think the ideal environment allows for all of them: code, dumb diagrams, code backed diagrams, diagrams that are 'code', and everything outside and between. If these coexist in a shared environment, we have the best chance at mutating them and ideally converging on the must useful representations for differing situations. (it is also of my personal opinion that diagrams as code will flourish in this kind of a environment)
