                "text": "Eudaimonia  (Greek: εὐδαιμονία [eu̯dai̯moníaː]), sometimes anglicized as eudaemonia or eudemonia , is a Greek word commonly translated as happiness or welfare; however, \"human flourishing or prosperity\"  and \"blessedness\" have been proposed as a more accurate translations.\nEtymologically, it consists of the words \"eu\" (\"good\") and \"daimōn\" (\"spirit\"). It is a central concept in Aristotelian ethics and political philosophy, along with the terms \"aretē\", most often translated as \"virtue\" or \"excellence\", and \"phronesis\", often translated as \"practical or ethical wisdom\". In Aristotle's works, eudaimonia (based on older Greek tradition) was used as the term for the highest human good, and so it is the aim of practical philosophy, including ethics and political philosophy, to consider (and also experience) what it really is, and how it can be achieved.\nDiscussion of the links between virtue of character (ēthikē aretē) and happiness (eudaimonia) is one of the central concerns of ancient ethics, and a subject of much disagreement. As a result there are many varieties of eudaimonism. Two of the most influential forms are those of Aristotle and the Stoics. Aristotle takes virtue and its exercise to be the most important constituent in eudaimonia but acknowledges also the importance of external goods such as health, wealth, and beauty. By contrast, the Stoics make virtue necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia and thus deny the necessity of external goods.",

I've talked to a lot of artists in my local community, and not many local artists can program. Those that do mostly use node-and-wire languages. One artist said that he could modify existing GLSL source code (for doing GPU shader effects in the Magic node-and-wire language), but he can't write this kind of source code from scratch. But node-and-wire programming is not a problem.\n\nI don't use node-and-wire languages myself. To test your claim about no if or let, I opened the Wikipedia page for Max-MSP. There is a screenshot of a Max program. It contains a large switch statement: There is a \"key\" node, and the output value flows into many \"select\" nodes, each of which are individual cases in the switch. There are also several \"if\" nodes. \"Let\" nodes for binding local variables seem unnecessary because the output of one node can be routed via branching wires to multiple inputs.\n\nTo me, the Max code is ugly and unstructured: it looks like a plate of spaghetti. I analysed the code into a hierarchical structure within my minds eye, including an imagined 'switch statement', but there's no hierarchy on the screen, just spaghetti. But not everybody's brain is wired the same way. I am very comfortable with text, grammar, mathematics, structure, hierarchy. I meet visual artists who can effortlessly draw in a way that feels beyond my abilities. I show some of these artists my code, and they just see gibberish.\n\nOne of the questions that interests me is, how to design a programming environment for artists? How does your brain work if you can rapidly draw a realistic figurative scene, but grammar is not your thing? You have relatively more grey matter for processing visual scenes, relatively less for parsing text. The node-and-wire presentation might be a lot easier for you to process.",
