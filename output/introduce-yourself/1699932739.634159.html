Hi all! Iâ€™m Mike Stringer from Chicago. When I have to introduce myself in a big channel like this I end up thinking <em>who... am... I?</em> Professionally my background is in physics, I started a data science consulting company, led the AI+Design practice at IDEO, shifted gears completely into "people ops / HR" (I like people even more than coding), and am currently in dabble/explore mode. A few books I think are related to the future of coding: <a href="https://worldcat.org/en/title/43718211">Information Ecologies</a>, <a href="https://worldcat.org/en/title/28504839">Mindstorms</a>, and <a href="https://worldcat.org/en/title/213300656">How To Talk About Books You Haven't Read</a>.<br/><br/>I was excited to read about this community,  and I'm looking forward to learning and sharing!
