This allows travelling between stars, refuelling the Stardrifter from Lithium ion-ejecting stars, approaching planets in star systems and their moons, and even landing where it is physically possible. Many planets feature atmospheres and weather effects. Some harbour plants and animals, or even mysterious ruins. No goal or measure of success is imposed by the game: it simply allows the player to catalogue and annotate the player's discoveries in a common database of stellar bodies called the GUIDE, which is to be synchronised over the author's Internet server.",

(Opening myself up to being dunked on in retaliation, haha. I deserve whatever I get.) It was a popular and well-reviewed game when it launched, so I might be in the minority here.\n\nProteus is neat and very short. Firewatch is superbly polished, and what it lacks in gameplay innovation it more than makes up for in mise-en-scene, and it tells a compelling story right from the outset.\n\nDear Esther and Firewatch are both described somewhat jokingly as _walking simulators_. My favourite of that cohort is What Remains of Edith Finch. It's fairly short (maybe 4-8 hours?) and a little buggy in places, but it does things with the combination of gameplay and narrative that I found deeply affecting and profound. Many of the most meaningful \/ memorable game experiences I've had were about the surprising interweaving of gameplay and narrative at just the right moment in just the right way — where the story is told through the gameplay itself, in a way that couldn't be replicated in any other medium. I'm always on the lookout for games that manage to do a good job of that. What makes What Remains of Edith Finch worth recommending here is that it delivers a few such interweavings, and it is a game that's highly accessible to players of any skill level. While other games that top my personal list require the player to be adept at shooters or puzzles or platformers, Edith Finch doesn't ask for anything more than the ability to move around in a 3d world. The game is critically acclaimed and was listed as the \"Game of the Year\" or a \"Game of the Decade\" by many publications, for whatever that's worth.\n\nThe company that published Edith Finch, Annapurna Interactive, has published a number of other games that I quite liked, so it might be worth taking a look at those to see if they have appeal.

Firewatch is superbly polished, and what it lacks in gameplay innovation it more than makes up for in mise-en-scene, and it tells a compelling story right from the outset.\n\nDear Esther and Firewatch are both described somewhat jokingly as "
