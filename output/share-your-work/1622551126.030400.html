Hey folks, after a long year of building and rebuilding <a href="https://gadget.dev/">Gadget</a>, we're finally gearing up for a launch. We're looking for early alpha users if anyone is interested (<a href="https://gadget.dev/">drop your email on the site</a> or DM me).<br/><br/><b>Problem:</b> Web development is slower and more expensive than it should be, because of the endless, repetitive boilerplate/glue code that developers have to manouver.<br/><b>Challenge:</b> Build a platform that gives developers a set of higher level building blocks, while providing them with the ability to drop down to a lower level when the abstractions don't work.<br/><b>Solution:</b> Gadget, a preconfigured, bundled development platform (IDE +++) that gives you a set of components with sane defaults that you can override, in code,  designed to meet the needs of modern web application developers.<br/><br/>Basically, Gadget is our vision of what "low code for devs" should actually feel like (for web app development). An experience where the computer is responsible for all the annoying busywork the developer doesn't want to do,  while leaving the engineer to make all the engineering decisions.<br/><br/>Here's a not-so-short video (20 min) where I build, deploy and test a declarative API for the backend of a Kanban board:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.loom.com/share/732816bb327c4155b61199d2d1733c56">https://www.loom.com/share/732816bb327c4155b61199d2d1733c56</a><br/><br/>Want to try it out?

<em>Think of Gadget as a fancy IDE that goes well beyond coding. The platform gives you components like a db, a serverless runtime, GraphQL API + your own NPM package, an auth system, state machines (...) ; all designed to help you build quickly.</em>

This shaping up nicely! The only bit of (superficial, sorry) feedback I've got at this point is that.. I'm not really able to understand what Gadget is, or what it's for, just by looking at the home page.<br/><br/>• I get that it's for building apps — but what kind of apps? Web apps? iOS apps? It'd be helpful to see an example (screenshot, or little video, or whatever) of an app built with Gadget.<br/>• The video shows me a few teases of Gadget UI, plus a huge comment block (which looks an awful lot like a boilerplate :/ )... but it doesn't give me a sense of what is actually happening. There's a brief second where I can see the sidebar on the left, which seems like it might help me understand the hierarchy of Gadget.. but it goes by too quickly to comprehend. (Products? Product variants? Is this Gadget itself, or something built with Gadget?)<br/>I'm sure the home page is not final. It's just hard for me to know if I could be an early alpha user just by looking at it (even taken together with the helpful problem / challenge / solution description you've posted here).

On a lighter note — "An experience where the computer is responsible for all the annoying busywork the developer doesn't want to do" — in this community, you might find that the folks here are a little more interested in building the things that handle (or cause!) that busywork than building things that leverage the absence of it :P<br/><br/>So it might be tough to find people to kick the tires on this. Hopefully you've got a community of folks somewhere who actually want to, you know, build some apps. They'll probably have much better feedback than the meta-level stuff you'll get here.

That's great feedback. The homepage is a placeholder for the time being, we're focusing our launch on a much smaller niche and we're talking to that audience via a separate landing page. But the feedback on the video is great regardless. WE shot it real fast, but it def misses the mark.

This is a very promising app, several of us at work are watching closely - makes a ton of sense - congrats on the progress

Thanks Chris. It's been a boatload of mind-numbingly challenging/fun work. More insanity to come. If you ever want to play with it on a side project, lmk. We could use more feedback
