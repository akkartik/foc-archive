        "text": "Yes good piece. It’s generally worthwhile, and fun, to point out glaring contradictions in what tech is purporting to be and what it really is. In the crypto \/ smart contracts  space there are plenty more outside of the tech itself to point out especially those dealing with socio-economic issues. However, web3 is not crypto or openesea as <@U014WA16VNJ> you point out (I’ve been trying for a while now to sort out what web3 is and can’t get a clear picture, but p2p is very promising and I think there is interesting work done and to be done there).\n\n<@UJFN50C00> your question regarding people not wanting to run their own servers. Yeah, even programmers don’t want to run servers (as Moxie points out). But I can’t count the number of times I’ve heard that “people don’t want to code” or “people just want good features in their app, they don’t want to change anything”  etc etc.\n\nThere are two issues here.\nOn the one hand it’s vacuous, because if the environments to do these sorts of things are essentially thoughtless, then we should not expect people to want to do these sorts of things. After all, it takes a certain kind of person to want to stare at a terminal full of characters all day, even if you have that solarized color-scheme dialed in just right and even if it is a means to some better end.\nOn the other hand, how do you know if you don’t actually provide people with reasonable expressive, understandable and malleable environments? How do you know if you have never tried? Historical examples show us there is a good chance they actually do. (And what does it mean to run a server really? spin up a “remote” VM in some “cloud” infrastructure which can see the rest of the world and your “client” is set to communicate with. Under the right conditions that could be the same as starting your application or, if we put a lid on the idea of siloed applications, then just starting up your “local” machine .)",

But I can’t count the number of times I’ve heard that “people don’t want to code” or “people just want good features in their app, they don’t want to change anything”  etc etc.\n\nThere are two issues here.\nOn the one hand it’s vacuous, because if the environments to do these sorts of things are essentially thoughtless, then we should not expect people to want to do these sorts of things. After all, it takes a certain kind of person to want to stare at a terminal full of characters all day, even if you have that solarized color-scheme dialed in just right and even if it is a means to some better end.\nOn the other hand, how do you know if you don’t actually provide people with reasonable expressive, understandable and malleable environments? How do you know if you have never tried? Historical examples show us there is a good chance they actually do. (And what does it mean to run a server really? spin up a “remote” VM in some “cloud” infrastructure which can see the rest of the world and your “client” is set to communicate with. Under the right conditions that could be the same as starting your application or, if we put a lid on the idea of siloed applications, then just starting up your “local” machine .)"
