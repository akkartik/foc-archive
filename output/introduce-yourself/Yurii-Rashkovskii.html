Hey there, I am Yurii. I am a founder at Omnigres (short spoiler: Postgres as an Application Runtime). I am very fond of continuous exploration of the computing and programming space, and I have a wide range of interests and skills: anywhere from MUMPS to Lisp, C to Rust, Prolog to SQL, you name it. I am also very interested in popularizing the lesser-known but great concepts that lead to better software (when I have the energy and inspiration for that!) – I’ve been at it professional over 20 years (and a bit more if I can count my earlier days.<br/><br/>I am based out of beautiful Vancouver Island in Canada and love the outdoors, [marathon] running, and a few other things.
