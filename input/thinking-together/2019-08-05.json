It means the world to me.\n\nAs far as how I see my role in this community, I see myself as a very efficient lighthouse: attracting people to a single place to find other people, for collaboration, link sharing, feedback, etc. What I like about this role is that it doesn't take that much time or money, but it can help make some really valuable connections.\n\nFor this Slack, I see myself as tending to a garden. I don't know why it works as well as it does, so I don't want to disturb it too much. While I personally don't like Slack, I am suspicious that this group works precisely because of the parts of Slack I like least: its unstructured chatiness. So I want to let this Slack be what it wants to be, with subtle pushes towards positive directions when necessary. Maybe that's too idealistic or just justifying my laziness...\n\nAll that said, I am really bullish on this broader community and school of thought and agree that community building here may be one of the most valuable things anyone can do. While I am happy with my current minimal level of community building activities (I still want to do research), I really welcome the help and energy of others here, and would gladly support other (even competing) efforts. I'd love to brainstorm ideas with anyone in this direction: piloting a new community in a platform better suited than Slack, setting up more online meetups or conferences, planning an in-person conference or meetup, setting up a \"journal\", etc. I've done brainstorming along these lines with <@U85MWBKEY> and <@U6KQ2S410>.\n\n(There is a small voice in my head that whispers that I should drop my own research and do community organizing full time, but I am telling it to be quiet because I am excited  about my own research at the moment. Maybe I will listen to it another day. I have fantasies of being a modern day Licklider,  going around giving out grants to people like us, but we'd gotta find the money somehow.

Data, code, and views are all editable and update dynamically as you make changes.\n\nEach document is a multiuser virtual machine, containing live content as well as editable code, and data. Leisure automatically shares changes to code and data and provides structures to support multiuser apps. Code can be in any of several supported languages (and mixed within a document).\n\nAlthough Leisure presents documents as if they are files, they are actually databases, so they can potentially scale up to very large amounts of data. Leisure also explores new programming tools, like AST viewers and embedded test cases, as well as a new, dynamically typed, pure functional language.\n\nThe video ends a little abruptly but I wanted to cram as much in there about the environment as I could.",
