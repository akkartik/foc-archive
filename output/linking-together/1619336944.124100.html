Hi all. I've not been here for a while due to writing up my PhD which is nearly done. I've accepted a post-doc position in a new lab in Iceland starting in September, working on creative AI for physical musical instruments, and designing embodied scientific instruments for working with big data experiments. It will absolutely involve some future of coding research, but perhaps not in a way that would be obviously recognisable.<br/>We have a funded PhD role available to join our group, get in touch if you're interested and/or please share the link: <a href="https://www.lhi.is/en/intent-phd-scholarship">https://www.lhi.is/en/intent-phd-scholarship</a><br/>Here's a blurb about the new lab (more soon): <a href="http://www.sonicwriting.org/blog/intent">http://www.sonicwriting.org/blog/intent</a><br/>And here's a link to the PI's book about music technology which I have to say is rather good: <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/sonic-writing-9781501313868/">https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/sonic-writing-9781501313868/</a>
