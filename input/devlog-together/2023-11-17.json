So really more like \"health\". The desire for seamless experience is bad for health the way sugar is bad for health. But even that isn't right. It _can be_ bad for health. If acted on. But living with the desire is hard! I'm tempted by sugar everyday. I often wish I could just stop desiring sugar. Then it would be easier to not act in a sugar-seeking manner.\n\nHopefully that's all clear now :sweat_smile: I'm very happy to receive the work people put in to reduce the number of seams in my experience. But if a website lays out wrong and fixes itself after I resize a little and rejigger the fonts, I try to put that out of my mind. I want to focus on the important stuff. Is this website giving me useful information, is it respectful of my attention, is it relaxed around me (not squirming, squirming to get its tentacles deeper into me). A seamless experience can't compensate for failings in these areas, and it is all too common for seamless experiences to hide all manner of deeper malfeasance. When we push for more seamless experiences we're also encouraging the organisms we interact with to grow more tentacles, make them more muscular, use them more ceaselessly in search of advantage. This is not conducive to our long-term health, to put it mildly. Let's cut the mild grasshopper some slack; hopefully then it won't turn into a locust.",

But if a website lays out wrong and fixes itself after I resize a little and rejigger the fonts, I try to put that out of my mind. I want to focus on the important stuff. Is this website giving me useful information, is it respectful of my attention, is it relaxed around me (not squirming, squirming to get its tentacles deeper into me). A seamless experience can't compensate for failings in these areas, and it is all too common for seamless experiences to hide all manner of deeper malfeasance. When we push for more seamless experiences we're also encouraging the organisms we interact with to grow more tentacles, make them more muscular, use them more ceaselessly in search of advantage. This is not conducive to our long-term health, to put it mildly. Let's cut the mild grasshopper some slack; hopefully then it won't turn into a locust."
