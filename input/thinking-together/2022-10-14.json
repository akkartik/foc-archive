Commercial software works much like that as well. In Open Source, everybody is responsible for their piece of code but not for its dependencies. In theory, it's the end user who installs everything who is responsible for the correct working of the assembly, but the typical end user can't really do much about technical problems.\n\nUltimately, it's the ambiguous self-image that Open Source developers (both individuals and communities) have. They want to be part of a network of like-minded developers who share code, but they also want large-scale adoption by end users. They end up advertising their products to end users while at the same time proclaiming in the small print not to be responsible for any problems. That's a mismatch between advertising and hard promises that's not so different from commercial vendors.",

In the world of artisanal and industrial products, clients deal with a single supplier, who is responsible for the product sold, including all its components from the supply chain. Commercial software works much like that as well. In Open Source, everybody is responsible for their piece of code but not for its dependencies. In theory, it's the end user who installs everything who is responsible for the correct working of the assembly, but the typical end user can't really do much about technical problems.\n\nUltimately, it's the ambiguous self-image that Open Source developers (both individuals and communities) have. They want to be part of a network of like-minded developers who share code, but they also want large-scale adoption by end users. They end up advertising their products to end users while at the same time proclaiming in the small print not to be responsible for any problems. That's a mismatch between advertising and hard promises that's not so different from commercial vendors."
