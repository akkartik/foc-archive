Hi Lucian, I read through your post and agree with almost all points. A couple of (random) thoughts:<br/>- Input Validation: Only allowing valid code makes editing cumbersome. There's been a lot of AST-based Structure Editors in the past that failed because refactorings that can easily be done in a text editor feel awkward in these structure editors. So while I think that structure editors have a lot to offer (see your other points for example), it's important to allow temporarily invalid states.<br/>- Semantic Highlighting: There's a project called Tree Sitter which aims to improve highlighting in Github's editors. It's an incremental parser basically.<br/>- Compilation: You describe compiling as an action manually triggered by the user. What do you think of automatic re-compilation? My current take on this is that the environment shouldn't have a manual "Compile" button but instead re-compile incrementally as I'm editing.<br/>- Deployment: This section could use more words. Setting up deployment on all technologies you mentioned involves a significant amount of knowledge / work and is non-trivial for both developers and users. In my opinion, deploying should be as easy as clicking on a "publish" button (without requiring any configuration beforehand), using an app should be as easy as opening a website and "installing" it should be as easy as pinning a tab in your browser.<br/>- Regarding your future plans, do you want to use an existing programming language or invent your own? Do you already know other projects in this area (like Lamdu, Hazel, Unison, Subtext, ...)?

some disorganized thoughts<br/>- allowing only correct syntax is doable (I've written such editors), it's hard to make the UI pleasant. We need more people prototyping structure editors and trying things out.<br/>- allowing only correct semantics is a different ballgame, depending on what you mean by that it moves your idea closer to a proof assistant. My intuition is that convincing the computer at each stage that your types are correct, is a massive burden.<br/>- I think you can think bigger on imports. Why do we need import statements at all? Index every function in the package repository for autocomplete. Create a stable link to the selected function, locally or remotely.<br/>- Creating a docker image doesn't solve much. Docker is kind of an ostrich mentality IMO - dependencies are hard, let's pretend they don't exist or don't matter. I'm of the exact opposite point of view, we should throw away the punchcard-era fiction that our programs are isolated input-output machines, instead concepts like persistence, error recovery, distribution, versioning should all be first class in the language. A "program" should encompass all elements of the system that it needs to function, and should be able to update itself without an extra-linguistic "deployment" system..

Dear Lucian, you made some good suggestions, but you didn't ask for hardly anything big. Kinda like a kid asking for a candy bar for xmas instead of wishing for a nice new red bicycle with all the extras... why not ask for a toolchain where you can write with almost no branching?, and where most of the code goes straight down (the easiest kind of code to handle), and an environment where the total number of API's that you use on a regular basis numbers in the dozens, instead of thousands? You forgot the greatest wish of all, which is to have support for that phase where you product has shipped to your millions of active users, and you have a way of recreating each and every user bug report so that the product converges towards zero bugs, instead of hovering at hundreds of thousands of "not reproducible" bugs like there are in the Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft bug databases!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stathis Sideris</span>, oops, I didn’t mean the use that word, as you probably realised :smile:<br/><br/>Ok, after reading your answers, I realise that this slack is not the intended audience. I agree with your suggestions, but I want to implement the tooling I talked about for two existing languages: Haskell and PureScript. That makes some of these ideas impossible.<br/><br/>In the long run, I also want the things you mentioned, but until then I want to improve the development experience for a language that already exists and has an ecosystem. Having said that, I want to address some of the things you mentioned.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Felix Kohlgrüber</span>, regarding invalid states, I was thinking of allowing a scratch pad where you can simply paste text. Other than that, the operations that I see on the AST are: adding a node, deleting it, moving it around and transforming it into a different node. The last one seems trickiest. I have in mind an interface similar to Vim input mode. Combine this with the fact that each Haskell declaration has a keyword, so you can write the keyword and press TAB (snippets style) and the form to add that specific declaration emerges. I haven’t given this a lot of thought, so the details are hazy.<br/><br/>I agree with what you said about compilation. As I said, I want to build this tooling for Haskell and PureScript. I already knew about Lambdu and Unison from your list.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jason Priestley</span>, I’ll have to think more about what you said regarding the semantics. this part is not clear to me either.<br/><br/>thank you all for your feedback!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Lucian Ursu</span> I'm sure this slack is the right audience for what you're planning to do. There's the "think big" approach of starting from scratch and more incremental approaches like improving the tooling for an existing language. To me, all of them are equally interesting and fit into this slack. "my thoughts on the ideal development toolset" in your original post made me think that you're trying to "think big" and under that assumption, your suggestions seemed "conservative" (which is the gist of Edward's feedback as well). Knowing that your goal is to be compatible with existing programming languages changes the perspective.<br/>Please keep posting about your work here :wink:

more random thoughs<br/><br/>&gt; input validation<br/><br/>agree with the above comments it will likely make things worse not better. As a simple example imagine a word processor that disallows mis-spelled words. You type 'w' and it deleted it as <b>not a complete word</b> Instead you have to past an entire word that starts with 'w'. Pasting anything else then a valid word is impossible. Extreme example but the same will happen with code. There are lots of invalid states needed in getting to a valid state.<br/><br/>I feel like editor integrated linters help here. They highlight possible issues but don't prevent input.<br/><br/>&gt; import management<br/><br/>There are infinite imports. I don't really want my environment giving me a list of 6000 completions when I type 'L'.<br/><br/>Same as above I feel like editor based linters help here. The editor's highlighting might suggested some completions, it might also mention that it can't find the requested module, but it doesn't stop me from specifiying it. It's possible I plan to add the module later. It's also possible I have a complex build and the editor can't find the module.<br/><br/>&gt; Identifier alias<br/><br/>This sounds like I'll be unable to read the code if I look at it anywhere but my environment since I'll only be used to my identifiers.<br/><br/>Better IMO are coding standards. For example Swift lists a bunch of naming suggestions<br/><br/><a href="https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/">https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/</a><br/><br/>&gt; Formatting<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of autoformatting,. The topic comes up about once a year on the Chromium team and gets shot down every time. The issue is formatting matters and autoformatters can't know when it does. Some of this is preference of course but for example, many style guides suggest to align end of line comments. Example (probably bad but I'm to lazy to figure out the perfect example)<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap"><br/>float vel = 123.45;               // velocity in meters per second;<br/>float acc = 42.1;                 // acceleration in meters per second ^ 2<br/>int dur = 21;                     // duration in frames<br/>Vector3 dir = { 1.2, 2.1, 7.9 };  // direction of acceleration in world space<br/></pre><br/><br/>If you accept the idea that aligning the comments makes the code more readable then you have to accept that alignment itself can make the code more readable.<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap"><br/>float   vel = 123.45;             // velocity in meters per second;<br/>float   acc = 42.1;               // acceleration in meters per second ^ 2<br/>int     dur = 21;                 // duration in frames<br/>Vector3 dir = { 1.2, 2.1, 7.9 };  // direction of acceleration in world space<br/></pre><br/><br/>I know the above is a bad example. I don't have time to dig through the Chromium code for better examples where formatting in a way any auto formatter would format makes the code far far less readable. I can just say they arguably exist. Maybe that could be solved by comments or something<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap"><br/>// autoformatting: off<br/>...<br/>code that doesn't follow auto-formatting rules<br/>...<br/>// autoformatting: on<br/></pre><br/><br/>but in general I find autoformatting to be constraining.<br/><br/>The Chromium team pretty much always responds "You're free to run an auto-formatter on any changes you make". You can not wholesale reformat a file but if you're making changes to a file you can run on auto-formatter on the changed lines. The team itself will not be adding an auto formatter. I agree with that decision.<br/><br/>&gt; Compilation<br/><br/>I work on projects that can take anywhere from 3 minutes to 4+ hours to build. I don't always want auto-compliation.<br/><br/>&gt; Deployment<br/><br/>I work on projects with gigabytes of final data and terabytes of source data. (Games).<br/><br/>Which reminds me<br/><br/><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/05/06/five-worlds/">https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/05/06/five-worlds/</a>

I can think of one other example for auto-formatting (still not sure it's a good example). The API signature for <tt>drawImage</tt> in the JavaScript Canvas API is <tt>drawImage(img, sourceRectX, sourceRectY, sourceRectWidth, sourceRectHeight, destRectX, destRectY, destRectWidth, destRectHeight)</tt><br/><br/>I will almost always choose to format that as<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap"><br/>drawImage(<br/>   imgRefence,<br/>   sourceRectArguments,<br/>   destRectArguments);<br/></pre><br/><br/>No auto formatter I know of has the knowledge to know the arguments are more readable if arguments 2,3,4,5 are on one line and 6,7,8,9 are on another so they will almost always make the code less readable IMO.

i would also like to point out that all of these alignment systems presume you are using a fixed-width font for your code, which is not going to carry on forever. the fixed width font is one of the last remaining holdovers from the 80 column punchcard.
