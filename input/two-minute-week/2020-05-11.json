As is usually the case in such circumstances, I spent some time cleaning up code and refactoring - I often find such activities help keep the project momentum up, while requiring less time &amp; effort.\nI have spent some time recently thinking about how to manage note events and synchronize beats &amp; timing.  It seems like a good idea to integrate Ableton Link at the outset, because on some level it helps drive towards a cleaner management of such things.  It is also really nice to have a built in way for musicians to work together with a live coder; a USP perhaps.  I don't say it in the video, but the tempo of the audio is being controlled using the iPad drumming app, which the sample app and the synth are aligning with.\nAnother piece of ongoing work is the integration of Orca-c which I've shown previously.  This is an embedded Orca inside my text editor and forms one way in which a coder can drive the synthesizer (and later, I hope, some geometry\/graphics too).  Orca isn't the only way I intend to generate music, but it represents a relatively easier integration than music languages, etc.  As I say in the video, there is still work to do to complete this feature.",
