Hi, I'm Mike, living on the southern edge of South Africa, out in the sticks, on a dodgy dirt track that hangs off the furthest reaches of the Internet Highway (remember that?) The electrons get to drive <b>very</b> slowly here.<br/><br/>I've been a developer (largely in the OO world) since the mid-1980s, now mostly-retired and doing some part-time work for [a non-profit](<a href="https://wethinkcode.co.za">https://wethinkcode.co.za</a>) that teaches development (so: more than mere programming!) to youngsters who would not ordinarily be able to get access to such. I work on curriculum things.<br/><br/>My interest in better software tooling is a natural consequence of my larger concern with Personal Computing (<a href="https://one.mikro2nd.net/pages/personal-computing/">https://one.mikro2nd.net/pages/personal-computing/</a>). I want to see our personal computation tooling serve us better as individuals, to help us think better, individually and in groups. That means I want the means of personal computation to be wrested (back) out of the grasp of the walled-garden overlords who want to use computers as Dystopian Television. Making such tools demands (much!) better software tooling, imho, and consequently I'm curious about what everybody here is up to.<br/><br/>Some of my thinking and writing about this is in my own web garden (<a href="https://one.mikro2nd.net/">https://one.mikro2nd.net/</a>) if you're interested.<br/><br/>edit: Erk! Didn't realise that those links would show up so obnoxiously in Slack. My apologies - I'll try and make them plain text instead. (Nope. That didn't work :() Is there a way to turn that preview nonsense off?

Welcome, I think if you mouseover the previews a small 'x' will appear on the left to remove them
