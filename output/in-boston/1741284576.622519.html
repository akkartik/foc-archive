Somerville-Cambridge Elder Services provides digital literacy support for older adults through their Technology Access Program. They provide 1-on-1 support and workshops for older adults. Their staff is also a part of a digital equity working group where caregivers of digital literacy come together to support each other in their work. They are looking to expand the number of their tech volunteers, so reach out if you'd be interested and/or share with others who you think might be interested!<br/><br/><a href="https://eldercare.org/find-what-you-need/advice-info/tap-events/">https://eldercare.org/find-what-you-need/advice-info/tap-events/</a>
