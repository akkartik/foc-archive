Unfortunately, doing a proper job of explaining the ways in which it is _not even wrong_ is a non-trivial undertaking (see <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brandolini%27s_law>). My best attempt at _extremely_ lossy compression:\n\nI am sympathetic to — and frequently make — related arguments with regards to “AI” claims for the current generation of machine learning systems. They are not agents, and non-agentic things are not intelligent in anything like the definition we use for biological entities. Any attempt to make something actually intelligent would start from _drives_ (something more like what we call _emotions_) than from simulating what many regard as intelligent activity (“write an essay based on a prompt”, &c). Failure to understand this is part of a long running tendency of clever humans who have been rewarded for “being smart” to over index on tasks for which they were rewarded rather than tasks that allowed 4 billion years of their ancestors to survive. On this general point I think I am in complete agreement with the authors.\n\nBut this doesn’t actually argue against the idea that biological entities are made of networks of parts undergoing processes, and that the behaviors of those parts (the nature of those processes) could be encoded in a different chemical substrate. Nor does it suggest that a mechanism that can model arbitrary processes (e.g. Turing machine) cannot model the specific processes going on inside the parts within those networks. The arguments they make against Deutsch-style pancomputationalism hinge on things like determinism\/syntactic formal systems that feel completely irrelevant in this context (Turing machines can model stochastic processes, and they are “symbolic” only in the sense that we use symbols to understand\/encode them).",

Failure to understand this is part of a long running tendency of clever humans who have been rewarded for “being smart” to over index on tasks for which they were rewarded rather than tasks that allowed 4 billion years of their ancestors to survive. On this general point I think I am in complete agreement with the authors.\n\nBut this doesn’t actually argue against the idea that biological entities are made of networks of parts undergoing processes, and that the behaviors of those parts (the nature of those processes) could be encoded in a different chemical substrate. Nor does it suggest that a mechanism that can model arbitrary processes (e.g. Turing machine) cannot model the specific processes going on inside the parts within those networks. The arguments they make against Deutsch-style pancomputationalism hinge on things like determinism\/syntactic formal systems that feel completely irrelevant in this context (Turing machines can model stochastic processes, and they are “symbolic” only in the sense that we use symbols to understand\/encode them)."
