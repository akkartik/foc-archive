    <h2>Archives, <a href='https://futureofcoding.org/community'>Future of Coding Community</a></h2>
    An attempt at combating the eternal present that people tend to inhabit
    online in the early 21st century.

    <p>
    Maintaining websites over years is difficult/expensive in the early 21st
    century, so this site relies on just static files. <a href='https://github.com/akkartik/foc-archive'>There's also a backup</a>;
    feel free to create mirrors or forks.

    <p>
    There's a lot of good stuff to showcase here. But who decides what is good?
    <ul>
      <li><a href='akkartik.html'>Kartik's favorite posts and comments</a>
      <li>&hellip;
    </ul>
    <p>
    <h3>help improve these archives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you have any favorite posts or comments? Wanna show off your own list? <a href='http://akkartik.name/contact'>Send them to Kartik.</a>
        (<a href="https://github.com/akkartik/foc-archive">Clone the repo or use Github search to look for them.</a>)
    </ul>
