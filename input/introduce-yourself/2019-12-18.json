I've been programming over 20 years, and it's not unusual that I'd like to automate something but I don't bother because I don't know how. Nor is it unusual that I run into a problem that I have no way to diagnose (e.g. on the weekend something kept writing to my HDD until it was full, but I had no way to figure out which process was doing it or what file they were writing to), or I see a program with an unusual feature and I wonder \"how did they do that?\" but I have no way to find out... It seems to me that most of the things people are trying to do here are valuable, whether it's improvements to traditional programming languages, code visualization, debugging tools, figuring out how to make other people's software easier to tweak, etc.",
