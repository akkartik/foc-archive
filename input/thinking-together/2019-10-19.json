Let me ask you about an issue I have for a long time.\n\nThe problem is that many times in “standard mainstream” languages a business term in the business logic is duplicated in different names and even IDEs can’t relate the dups, I have to rely on Good ol’ Search &amp; Replace and\/or regex - which does not help much really.\n\nWhat I’d like to see if I’d be able to assemble function names just as other piece of data in my program. I am wondering if that feature already exist somewhere (I’d suspect it’s in LISP if anywhere).\n\nExample:\nInstead having `setA(A a), setB(B b), setC(C c)`\nor `(setA a), (setB b), (setC c)` as different functions,\nI’d like to have `([set A] a), ([set B] b),([set C] c)`.\n\nSo next time when I want to refactor\/rename `A`, or even `set` to something else, I’d be able to do that easily.\n\nThe reason I got there is that I am really into Refactoring and my belief is the easiest Refactoring method is(\/must be) Renaming so its a shame not being able to Rename stuff in 0.1 sec. (just changing the characters, not even addressing the change in meaning!) Without easy, secure renaming (lol) my productivity can’t even start.",

Then, you may switch between jargon and abstraction in the view layer as you go.\n\nIdentifiers should strive to be non-entangled, eg. `setTemperature termostat 15deg` could instead be `set temperature of termostat to 15deg`. If we then also have `set volume of speaker to 20db`, the `set` identifier could be (auto) linked as the same \"action type\", and thus renamed to, eg. \"adjust\" (or only rename when used with a temperature (then, \"adjust\" will become an alias to \"set\" with a specific association to \"temperature\")).",

The fact that the browsers are controlled by a few entrenched competitors, and due to the baroque hypercomplex and messy design of the web which just keeps tacking on more function like the Winchester Mystery House is not ideal. That these big organizations are immune to suggestions and changes, and bugs don't get fixed promptly, makes we yearn for a simpler less messy underpinnings. The web browsers refuse to let us use UDP packets, except when they deem it okay, and UDP is the way to go for high performance; so much less overhead than TCP.  Google &amp; its co-conspirators have been steering the web browser towards being an operating system bigger than windows. It was a clever strategy and clearly has convinced young people that it is the only way forward. I would prefer a real operating system, that is lean and mean, and not such a mess. CSS is one of the worst layout methodologies ever invented. Like the original US television system which was called NTSC (later nicknamed never twice the same color), i wish i could find an ancronym for CSS that involves mysterious movement of your blocks in baffling ways.",

The fact that the browsers are controlled by a few entrenched competitors, and due to the baroque hypercomplex and messy design of the web which just keeps tacking on more function like the Winchester Mystery House is not ideal. That these big organizations are immune to suggestions and changes, and bugs don't get fixed promptly, makes we yearn for a simpler less messy underpinnings. The web browsers refuse to let us use UDP packets, except when they deem it okay, and UDP is the way to go for high performance; so much less overhead than TCP.  Google & its co-conspirators have been steering the web browser towards being an operating system bigger than windows. It was a clever strategy and clearly has convinced young people that it is the only way forward. I would prefer a real operating system, that is lean and mean, and not such a mess. CSS is one of the worst layout methodologies ever invented. Like the original US television system which was called NTSC (later nicknamed never twice the same color), i wish i could find an ancronym for CSS that involves mysterious movement of your blocks in baffling ways."

        "text": "<@UEQ6M68H0> “i am none too happy about big brother spying on my every keystroke” I’m concerned about that as well, but there’s no requirement that a web browser be used with a server.  I’m using single page Javascript apps straight from a local file the desktop. Also, being able to choose to drop the same file onto a server where everyone could run it at the click of a link is extremely valuable (consider how many fewer potential users would be willing to download and install an app vs clicking on a link). As for UDP\/TCP, all the browsers will be supporting full UDP &amp; TCP sockets and mDNS soon. Take a look at the Chrome or Firefox dev builds. There’s also no need to use either HTML (besides a few lines to boot your JS code with) or CSS (aside from setting style attributes on elements via JS). I’d agree that the DOM is not the layout engine I’d design, but it’s very fast and full featured, and runs everywhere. While it makes may things that used to be easy, more difficult (view management), it also makes many things that used to be very hard, very easy (text layout). The value of the browser’s sandbox is also worth considering. For security reasons, I don’t run any apps that aren’t from highly trusted sources on my trusted laptop anymore, and certainly no code downloaded from github. Maybe that will change once the desktop apps and terminal are fully sandboxed but it’s looking like that will probably come in the form of app signing from big vendors like MS, Google and Apple and I don’t want any of them controlling what apps I can run. The browser is the only escape (for typical users) from the app signing Dystopia.",

I’m using single page Javascript apps straight from a local file the desktop. Also, being able to choose to drop the same file onto a server where everyone could run it at the click of a link is extremely valuable (consider how many fewer potential users would be willing to download and install an app vs clicking on a link). As for UDP\/TCP, all the browsers will be supporting full UDP & TCP sockets and mDNS soon. Take a look at the Chrome or Firefox dev builds. There’s also no need to use either HTML (besides a few lines to boot your JS code with) or CSS (aside from setting style attributes on elements via JS). I’d agree that the DOM is not the layout engine I’d design, but it’s very fast and full featured, and runs everywhere. While it makes may things that used to be easy, more difficult (view management), it also makes many things that used to be very hard, very easy (text layout). The value of the browser’s sandbox is also worth considering. For security reasons, I don’t run any apps that aren’t from highly trusted sources on my trusted laptop anymore, and certainly no code downloaded from github. Maybe that will change once the desktop apps and terminal are fully sandboxed but it’s looking like that will probably come in the form of app signing from big vendors like MS, Google and Apple and I don’t want any of them controlling what apps I can run. The browser is the only escape (for typical users) from the app signing Dystopia."
