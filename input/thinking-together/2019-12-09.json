        "text": "<@UF89Z7SRF> At this point I'm more curious about your style of reasoning. As far as I can see, you haven't attempted to explain what abstraction means to you in abstract terms. Instead you always turn to examples and have posted quite a few of them here. Nothing wrong with that, in fact they would all be super helpful to illustrate an abstract description.\n\nBy arguing like that, somewhat ironically, you leave out the crucial step of generalizing what the concept means to you and leave it to us to interpret your examples to find the commonalities ourselves.\n\nI've tried, and I am unfortunately not able to come to the conclusions you do using your examples. I tried to acknowledge that in my explanation of how I interpret _abstraction_ by offering _transformation_ as a more generic concept that I believe fits all your examples and also my understanding of _abstraction_ itself, trying to create some common ground.\n\nNow on the other hand, I so far have only offered my abstract explanation and no specific examples. So let me try that and meet you where you are:\n\nTake an `apple` and a `banana`. In our (hopefully shared) English folk taxonomy, we would classify both as `fruit`. We're generalizing, ignoring some of the properties `apple`s and `banana`s have.\nOr take `green` and `yellow`. Both `color`s. Same process. That's what I call `abstraction`.\n\nBased on your examples I feel like you come into this claiming \"yellow is an abstraction of banana\".\n\nYou jump between domains. And that's interesting. I don't really understand it. Also, it's not obviously wrong! It's somewhat clever because, yes, bananas are usually yellow, and just looking at the color of bananas feels very similar to the process I described above.\n\nStill I come to the conclusion to reject it as a form of `abstraction` and point out the requirement to stay within the same domain.\nHere's why:\n\nWhen we agree that an `apple` is a `fruit`, we gain a powerful tool as part of our language that allows us to communicate more efficiently. It's not just introducing a new name for something. It's more than that. We can jump between the levels of abstraction as we see fit and say \"`fruit`s are healthy\" and don't have to list all the individual fruits. At the same time we can walk into a supermarket and say \"an `apple`, please\" and get exactly the fruit we want.\n\n(From my understanding of Lakoff, there are kinesthetic image schemas _container_ and _whole-part_ at play here, and we use metaphorical structure to add additional meaning to the relationship between `apple` and `fruit`.)\n\nWhat do we get if we accept the same relation between `banana` and `yellow`?\n\nI can't see the same benefits there and to me it's mostly confusing, even though I can see why it appears similar.\n\nThat's why I'd like to keep `abstraction` for the concept with these specific benefits, and leave `transformation` or `mapping` for the concept without. It feels like we have good words for all these things already, and watering down `abstraction` only makes it harder for us to communicate.",

Nothing wrong with that, in fact they would all be super helpful to illustrate an abstract description.\n\nBy arguing like that, somewhat ironically, you leave out the crucial step of generalizing what the concept means to you and leave it to us to interpret your examples to find the commonalities ourselves.\n\nI've tried, and I am unfortunately not able to come to the conclusions you do using your examples. I tried to acknowledge that in my explanation of how I interpret _abstraction_ by offering _transformation_ as a more generic concept that I believe fits all your examples and also my understanding of _abstraction_ itself, trying to create some common ground.\n\nNow on the other hand, I so far have only offered my abstract explanation and no specific examples. So let me try that and meet you where you are:\n\nTake an `apple` and a `banana`. In our (hopefully shared) English folk taxonomy, we would classify both as `fruit`. We're generalizing, ignoring some of the properties `apple`s and `banana`s have.\nOr take `green` and `yellow`. Both `color`s. Same process. That's what I call `abstraction`.\n\nBased on your examples I feel like you come into this claiming \"yellow is an abstraction of banana\".\n\nYou jump between domains. And that's interesting. I don't really understand it. Also, it's not obviously wrong! It's somewhat clever because, yes, bananas are usually yellow, and just looking at the color of bananas feels very similar to the process I described above.\n\nStill I come to the conclusion to reject it as a form of `abstraction` and point out the requirement to stay within the same domain.\nHere's why:\n\nWhen we agree that an `apple` is a `fruit`, we gain a powerful tool as part of our language that allows us to communicate more efficiently. It's not just introducing a new name for something. It's more than that. We can jump between the levels of abstraction as we see fit and say \"`fruit`s are healthy\" and don't have to list all the individual fruits. At the same time we can walk into a supermarket and say \"an `apple`, please\" and get exactly the fruit we want.\n\n(From my understanding of Lakoff, there are kinesthetic image schemas _container_ and _whole-part_ at play here, and we use metaphorical structure to add additional meaning to the relationship between `apple` and `fruit`.)\n\nWhat do we get if we accept the same relation between `banana` and `yellow`?\n\nI can't see the same benefits there and to me it's mostly confusing, even though I can see why it appears similar.\n\nThat's why I'd like to keep `abstraction` for the concept with these specific benefits, and leave `transformation` or `mapping` for the concept without. It feels like we have good words for all these things already, and watering down `abstraction` only makes it harder for us to communicate."

Bananas contain naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, particularly potassium-40 (40K), one of several naturally-occurring isotopes of potassium. One BED is often correlated to 10-7 sievert (0.1 μSv); however, in practice, this dose is not cumulative, as the principal radioactive component is excreted to maintain metabolic equilibrium. The BED is only meant to inform the public about the existence of very low levels of natural radioactivity within a natural food and is not a formally adopted dose measurement.",

But that is nothing compared to being in a state of flow writing code to make music with other people. It becomes a full-body experience, coding, hearing, feeling in the _now_. I think the future of coding needs to include using code to interact with the world and the other people in it. I see that same motivation in dynamicland so it's a bit strange if this kind of liveness isn't accepted as the core to the future of coding.",

Taken to an extreme, those following the example of these imagined plumbers would have no interest in learning from another's work, or striving for a higher ideal through friendly competition, or acknowledging the excellence achieved by peers. In my encounters with anyone doing a trade or craft (whether plumbing, electrical, framing, carpentry, leatherwork, weaving, etc) the people who seem to genuinely care about doing good work themselves _always_ also care about identifying good (and bad) work around them. I think there's probably a strong correlation here, if not causation.",

Yes, if the type system helps you achieve the end goal better\/faster\/simpler go for it, but we shouldn't loose the end goal from sight, and I see cases where the end user is an excuse to play with fancy toys and I never read about what was like to put prototypes in front of end users and see them try to achieve day to day activities with them."

In architecture's case Alexander asserts the deeper goal is making places for people to live and thrive in, and that peer approval for its own sake gets in the way of that.\n\nSo then I would assert: a culture of excellence and craftsmanship is distinct from one of obsessive peer approval.",

In architecture's case Alexander asserts the deeper goal is making places for people to live and thrive in, and that peer approval for its own sake gets in the way of that.\n\nSo then I would assert: a culture of excellence and craftsmanship is distinct from one of obsessive peer approval."
