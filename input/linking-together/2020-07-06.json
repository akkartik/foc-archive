I only claimed that the fact that you need a stash of batteries is a problem. I went to Amazon, typed in Cr2032 and the first hit was expensive. My bad for not looking deeper but it was irrelevant to the point. The point isn't that they cost 30 cents each or $2.50 each. The point is you need lots of them. I only own a single thing that eats batteries, that's my Oculus controllers. They eat ~1 AA battery a month. That means mostly not thinking about it. I buy a pack of 6-12 AA batteries and I'm set for a 6 months to a year. Otherwise the only things in my life that eat batteries are a couple of remotes which need a new battery every 2-3 years. My 6 PS4 controllers (4 dual shock, 2 moves). My 4 switch controllers, my 4 phones, my tablet, all recharge. Oh, I used to use a bluetooth mouse on my desktop, it required a AA battery but less than once a year. So no, don't own a single thing that used batteries at the same level as a set of these would use.\n\nHere we have a device that needs 6 to 36 new batteries every XX hours. From the links you posted\n\n&gt; I am getting 30+ hours on CR2032s.\n&gt; \n&gt; ... We arrive at our ~50 hours of gameplay by this measure,\n&gt; \n&gt; I also have a full set of LIR2032 (rechargeable equivalent), - maybe 8 hours on a charge.\nSomeone mentions recharger. Again, maybe I didn't look deep enough. I only see chargers that take 4 batteries so either I have be vigilant and make sure I always have a full set of 18-36 charged else I need 5 to 9 chargers.\n\nI went through this same issue with candles. I can buy wax candles (100 for $4) <https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/us\/en\/p\/glimma-unscented-tealights-50097995\/> but of course they have a certain amount of danger given they are actually on fire. I looked into battery powered ones (<https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Flameless-Vivii-Battery-powered-Unscented-Tealights\/dp\/B01MQ1Q3R1\/>) which are also relatively cheap (36 for $9) but they require 36 spare batteries which I decided I didn't want to deal with that so decided against buying the candles.",

This is the same system that they use for the notification pucks at restaurants, that lets you know your table is ready.
