A nice <a href="https://www.jimruttshow.com/samuel-arbesman/">podcast episode</a> with Jim Rutt inverviewing <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Sam Arbesman</span> on his new book "The Magic of Code" (which is now on my reading list). A good reminder (for those who need it, perhaps not so much people here) that computing is not just utilitarian.<br/><br/>Since Sam is around here, some short feedback:<br/>1. It's weird to hear both of you dismissing APL as a mess not even worth learning, and then discussing computing as a tool for thought a few minutes later. The link between the topic should be obvious from just the title of Ken Iverson's Turing Award lecture, "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/358896.358899">Notation as a tool of thought</a>:null:<a href="https://apis.ebsco.com/public/linkout/v1/ftf?ref=79c1a803-bf3b-412a-9841-5283f3cceab1&amp;id=627071">"</a>, which I definitely recommend everybody to read. APL was designed as a mathematical notation for algorithmic problems, and only later turned into an executable notation at IBM. It is certainly not, and was never meant to be, a language for writing large software systems. But for its intended problem domain, it still is a good choice.<br/>2. Programming languages not based on English are indeed rare, but there are a few interesting examples beyond just translating keywords. <a href="https://wy-lang.org/">文言 (wenyan)</a>  is based on classical Chinese that tries to incorporate even its grammar. <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~imarkov/Perligata.html">Perligata</a> similarly takes inspiration from Latin grammar to build a Perl-like language on something pretty close to Latin (though not being "good" Latin, neither in vocabulary nor grammar). For those who read French, the <a href="https://codesource.hypotheses.org/files/2025/01/BMeles-Programmer_autres_langues.pdf">slides of a presentation by Baptiste Mélès</a> say something about both these projects (I think the presentation was recorded, but I can't find it anywhere). <a href="https://hedy.org/">Hedy</a> by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Felienne</span> and coworkers is a very different take on this topic: a language meant to make programming accessible to people from various cultural backgrounds.

Thanks for the kind words and for this feedback. That piece by Iverson is fantastic and I had forgotten it was all about APL! I'll stop crapping on APL in the future! And good pointers re programming languages not based on English; this is wonderful! Thanks.
