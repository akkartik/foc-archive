In practice most places where I encounter a specification is when some aspect of a system has to be determined without constraining the entire implementation. For instance, two teams need to make two components that interact, the specification only defines the interaction, not the rest of the implementation. Or a product has certain requirements that must be communicated, a specification identifies those while allowing the implementors to use their discretion to define other aspects. <br/><br/>In these cases it's deliberate and preferred that a specification can't be executed. <br/><br/>When does someone want a specification that is equivalent to a program?
