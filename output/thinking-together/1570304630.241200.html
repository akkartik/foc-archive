<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Dekorte</span> agreeâ€” lack of deep empathy from coders to non-coders is a big contributing factor to stagnation.<br/><br/>Along those lines, I think there is a big issue with self-selection bias. Coders are precisely those people who have survived the process of learning to code in the environment as it exists, so they will naturally be the ones who are not bothered enough by it to turn away. But they are also the ones who would have to make it into something completely different.
