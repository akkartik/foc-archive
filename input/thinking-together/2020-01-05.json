He’s using a mathematical approach to come up with an improved definition of simplicity and I like the projection idea.\n\nThe example with how many files you create to separate 300 functions in a library reminds me of something else: if you look at the problem as three layers of abstraction — 1 library, 12 modules, 300 functions — the developer he describes clearly values a flatter hierarchy with only two layers and thinks that is simpler. He also mentions a usual approach would be to have 12 files for each module with functions grouped by how they relate to each other, likely causing different files to have a different number of functions.\n\nThis reminds me of Christopher Alexander’s fundamental properties of wholeness, in particular the one called Layers of Scale. In architecture Alexander proposed that for a building structure to feel whole, it needs visible layers in gradually increasing or decreasing scales — a hierarchy, but not just any hierarchy, but each layer in the hierarchy has elements that are roughly similar in size (or complexity).\n\nThis ties into complexity research and _The Architecture of Complexity_, why we see hierarchical structure everywhere, where it comes from, and why it’s so common in biological systems. I also like to connect that to my favorite linguist Lakoff and the container and part-whole kinesthetic image schemas that are building blocks of our cognition, how we make sense of our environment, and how we metaphorically structure the concept of hierarchy in our minds. And it ties into other cognitive science, like the famous 7+–2 study, which has turned out to be not quite exact, but the overall idea that we have limited capacity of what we can keep in our working memory still holds, and it is likely what causes us to want more structure after we accumulate too many things at once, and then we like to add another layer and stick them in categories. Think of when you make a list (shopping list items, to dos, articles to read, etc.); at some point you want tags or categories or directories to “keep a better overview”.\n\nIn programming we create hierarchies all the time. Often we don’t try to keep the things we stick into categories similar enough to achieve well-balanced layers of scale. A function can be a one-liner or several screens long, often you find both kinds in the same project. Classes or types can have few or many methods. Data types can have few or many properties. And how many files do we want in our projects.\nWe have a strong sense for hierarchy, but we don’t care as much about scale. I wonder what would happen if we changed that.\n\n_(That’s another attempt at explaining something that ties together too many separate disciplines and is probably still hard to understand if you haven’t read the same papers I read. I’m trying to get better at explaining these things without the need to have all that context, so any questions or feedback what needs further clarification is much appreciated.)_",

I also like to connect that to my favorite linguist Lakoff and the container and part-whole kinesthetic image schemas that are building blocks of our cognition, how we make sense of our environment, and how we metaphorically structure the concept of hierarchy in our minds. And it ties into other cognitive science, like the famous 7+–2 study, which has turned out to be not quite exact, but the overall idea that we have limited capacity of what we can keep in our working memory still holds, and it is likely what causes us to want more structure after we accumulate too many things at once, and then we like to add another layer and stick them in categories. Think of when you make a list (shopping list items, to dos, articles to read, etc.); at some point you want tags or categories or directories to “keep a better overview”.\n"

There's no zero sum game being played by translation software and language learning software. People fail just as hard as technological systems when their jobs become too complex. And burdening someone with the knowledge of video conferencing network protocols doesn't make them less angry about dropped calls.\n\nIt's certainly a failure of the way user-centered design is practiced that designers so often neglect a person's need to be empowered to learn, a person's need to be resilient in the case of failure, and a person's need to understand the consequences of their actions. But if you find yourself practicing user-centered design for FoC, you're going to be thinking about those needs just by the nature of your project, and there's no reason you couldn't take those same biases with you to any other project, or convince other designers that they're important.\n\nAlso, black boxes are not the problem to be solved, and complicated → simple → too simple is not just a matter of complexity changing hands. If you made some translation software and were concerned about a person's need to wean themself off of it and have fun by actually learning the language, it doesn't matter that the translation happens in a black box. No fraction of exposed translation technology is going to empower them to learn the language. To do a good job, you're going to invent wholly new complexity in the form of a language learning system for which some of the complexity is in the user's hands and some is in the designer's. Nothing about black boxes prevents you from satisfying that need. Similarly, car engines are too complicated for everyone to understand, but designers address your need for resilience to engine failure not by exposing parts of the engine, but by adding a totally separate backup system that's easily understood: the hooks that allow you to attach your car to another.\n\nSo I wouldn't jump immediately to making white box systems. If you're consciously reacting to a person's needs, chances are that you'll think of more ways to do that than exposing the system's guts.\n\nI did really like the article. I just don't think there's anything I could add to the parts I agree with. :slightly_smiling_face:",
