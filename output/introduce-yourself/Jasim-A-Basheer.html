Hey folks, I'm Jasim and for a long time I thought that programming was just expressions, mutation, loops, and i/o - and you had it all. "Give me a Turing machine and I shall move mountains" or something like that.<br/><br/>But one day I had enough - a Javascript framework I used at work was not performant, yet I couldn't dig down because its abstractions were opaque and non-programmable. And it was making it difficult to do my job, causing real stress. But I couldn't put my hands on what was actually wrong. Was it my lack of understanding, or had it to do with the tool itself? To get to its root I had to understand programming at a meta-level and that rabbit hole took me into CTM by Peter Van Roy, who describes it thus:<br/><br/>&gt; We define programming, as a general human activity, to mean the act of extending or changing a system's functionality. Programming is a widespread activity that is done both by nonspecialists (eg: consumers who change the settings of their alarm clock or cellular phone) and specialists (computer programmers, the audience for this book).<br/><br/>I see the <em>future of programming</em> as this infinite game were things that previously needed specialists keep moving into non-specialist territory, yet the field keeps growing and constantly keeps giving birth to new specialisations.<br/><br/>And I'm working on a product at a distant proximity to this: a tool for UI designers that makes their designs live by providing clean &amp; precise HTML and CSS as they design. It is called Protoship Codegen and is at <a href="https://protoship.io">https://protoship.io</a>.<br/><br/>I tweet at <a href="http://twitter.com/jasim_ab">twitter.com/jasim_ab</a>, where I mostly advocate for the mainstreaming of Typed Functional Programming, am a regular listener of the podcast, and am excited to meet you all!
