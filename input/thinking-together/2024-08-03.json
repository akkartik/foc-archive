        "text": "I wonder if the issue might be with the word “programming”. I try to be careful to use the phrase “function-based programming” instead of “functional programming”. Function-based programming covers many more programming languages than functional-programming covers. I think of “programming” to mean solderless - quick and easy - reconfiguration of reprogrammable machines. At that low level, functions are not inherently supported by hardware - you have to \/add\/ software and hardware to make “programs” work like “functions”, i.e. you have to add lots of inefficiency to allow manipulation of reprogrammable hardware to make the hardware expressible as mathematical equations written on paper. I think that the paradigm of functions-grafted-onto-hardware is inappropriate for many modern problems, like internet, robotics, gaming, GUIs, etc. as witnessed by the invention of extreme gyrations and work-arounds such as thread libraries, promises, monads, etc. Early FORTRANs and BASICs did not express hardware manipulation as mathematical functions. Early Lisps showed that grafting functions onto hardware was viable and was a productive \/paradigm\/. Sector Lisp shows just how clean and small this can be when the paradigm is respected. Yet, early games showed that this kind of thinking was \/not\/ necessary. I feel that so-called “computer science” ran with only the one paradigm - i.e. inefficient, function-based thinking mapped onto hardware manipulation - at the expense of cutting off many avenues of problem-solving. For the record, C and Pascal and Haskell and Python and JS and WASM and ..., are function-based, while PROLOG is not function-based, and, StateCharts are not function-based. I think that the function-based mentality deeply affects developers and, therefore, affects what developers can invent for non-programmers. I think that spreadsheets are just a stop-gap technology. Spreadsheets are “the best” that programmers can provide for non-programmers given developers’ function-based mentality. Mathematical 2D notation is OK for use with papyrus and clay-tablet media, but, is not necessarily the most appropriate way to think about reprogrammable electronic machines in 2024. So, in my mind, we need to change the culture of \/developers\/ before even trying to imagine FoP (Future of Programming). I think that TMOAD (The Mother Of All Demos) was not bound by the function-based paradigm and that function-based programmers hold TMOAD in awe because it looks non-understandable - like magic - from a mono-paradigmatic perspective. I think that it would behoove modern programming researchers to delve deeply into TMOAD and to see how it differs from function-based thinking.",
