On a related note, I encourage everyone in the US who can to vote as early as they can, just to ensure their vote is counted, and to give the country as a whole as much information as possible by the end of Nov 3rd. Regardless of worldview, I hope we can all agree that everybody's vote should count, and that the USPS has been caught between a rock and a hard place this election season.

Who decides what's disinformation? This week it's Q, next week it could be you. This is a freedom of speech issue, which is supposed to be protected in the US. They may be "private" companies with a right to decide what speech they approve of, but once they get this big, it's hard to argue they're not a commons of sorts. Plus, of course, all the big online companies work intimately with government, often synchronising their purges of opinions the US empire disagrees with.

"hidden breeding grounds for disinformation campaigns and organizing platforms for extremists" is emotive language that wouldn't be out of place in any historical or fictional dystopia you like, from Nazi Germany to 1984 up to The Handmaid's Tale. Demonising the "others" is a long-standing technique of control over populations.

I don't think your example of Nazi Germany shows what you think it does. Before they came to power and built up a propaganda machine, the Nazis gained influence by a combination of disinformation and physical violence that othered Jewish people. So free speech can in fact be used for othering.<br/><br/>I used to think Germany was being silly and fighting the last war by still banning anyone from articulating Nazi belief systems in public, down to the present day. But then I saw the effect that Radio Rwanda had on the genocide there, and that gave me pause. Germany has been closer to the abyss than the rest of us. We should assume they know something we don't.<br/><br/>The internet has given people new capabilities, and that is always accompanied by social turmoil as we figure out how to change the rules to find a new equilibrium. But clinging to "free speech" is just as reactionary as the side you're opposing. It's been shown up to be an ill-posed idea. Large parts of the phase space it encompasses are still valuable, but we need a new framework for pinning down the boundaries of the desirable space.<br/><br/>My current best-guess framing for the world we find ourselves in is to carve out exceptions to free speech when they incite violence. But there's still a lot of leaks to plug in that seam of the world.

Free speech is an ill-posed idea because it can incite violence? Not sure if that's what you're saying there?<br/><br/>I think we've all always agreed on the obvious exceptions to free speech (saying anything with powerful emotion that causes harm to others is the most obvious)

Self-censoring and fear of speaking out due to fear of the consequences (from social shaming all the way to being beaten) is currently an everyday reality. Not the world I grew up in, and miss so much.

&gt; I think we've all always agreed on the obvious exceptions to free speech (saying anything with powerful emotion that causes harm to others is the most obvious)<br/>Citation required. To my knowledge speech is free <em>precisely</em> because it is held to not cause harm. Radio Rwanda's broadcasts would not have run afoul of <em>Brandenburg</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech#Limitations">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech#Limitations</a>)<br/><br/>Above all, it's not clear to me that people have ever <em>agreed</em> on the lines circumscribing free speech.<br/><br/>&gt; Self-censoring and fear of speaking out due to fear of the consequences (from social shaming all the way to being beaten) is currently an everyday reality. Not the world I grew up in, and miss so much.<br/>Again, citation required. I think the reputational consequences of speech have always been around, and we have all always grown up watching what we say. The expectation to speak without consequence is usually comorbid with some level of privilege. What <em>has</em> changed in recent times (and this is the "new capability" I alluded to above) is that it's become easy to cast your voice far and wide. That makes it easy to cast your words <em>farther than you want</em>. It's not a difference in kind, merely one of degree. Like needing to unlearn some skills when switching from tennis to racketball.<br/><br/>You are permitted to compare the US to Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia and Maoist China the day we start throwing people in prison for being racist :wink: Facebook groups aren't quite there. Yet.

I’d prefer if we keep regional political discussions out of our community. There’s already enough of a presumption in software development that the world stops at the US border... I’m unable to escape American politics no matter where I look :confused:.

It is American politics at this moment. But the original issue that Mozilla stated and asked to sign up for does not stop at any country border. In India we face a similar problem now. Tons and tons of mis-information. You just need to look out of your window and you will be amazed to see that the world is spread beyond the US border.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nick Smith</span> (et al) — As far as current rules and guidelines go, this sort of discussion is fine for #present-company as long as everyone keeps their cool. I find it interesting, but I'm opting to not participate because my political views are incendiary (or at least I like to think they are, haha). As a non-American, I'm with you that it would be nice to see more discussion of non-American politics, especially as it pertains to FoC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn">Project Cybersyn</a> comes to mind). But I view that as an "in addition to", not an "instead of" this sort of discussion.<br/><br/>It's good that you voiced your concern about the discussion. I'll take all the feedback I can get — just because I feel "fine" with it doesn't mean it's good for the health of the community. If you'd like to talk about it more, send me a DM or feel free to spin up a new discussion in #administrivia.

I do object a bit here <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span>. I do understand that the matter has some relations with present ongoing election and political scene in America but I also firmly believe that it represents a side of technology that we should all be very cautious about. This is a powerhouse of bad things and Future of Coding does not only mean Technological or Design advances in computer science but it also means ethically better computing. Don't you agree? I am a non-american and I posted this here for that reason. Not to discuss or ignite a discussion about American politics rather to discuss what FoC can do to prevent such kind of sources.

We could have an FoC-oriented discussion on the subject (or, really, any subject). But you began this thread with "Not directly FoC but I guess highly important", which isn't much of a prompt for any particular kind of discussion. If you'd like to point the conversation in a new direction, by all means go for it. Tell us a little more of what you think about the ideas in article.

I agree on that <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> that my original post wordings were poorly chosen. And I probably should have written something about how I feel this is a growing problem for the time to come. I grew up in an Analog First world in India in 1990's and the more the world is becoming digital first the more strange problem are arising which we are very poorly equipped to solve at the moment. I sometimes feel that often we do not understand the true implications of a particular innovation in its full breadth and depth.
