I’ve read that Alexander thought that community missed the point, and from _Timeless Way_ I believe it. From the first chapter he gets into the concept that people should be able to build their own buildings, that it doesn’t take extensive planning, and that it resonates with something very natural within us and within the world.

But even the patterns didn’t ultimately help people create what Alexander had in mind and so he tries to synthesize both extremes in his magnum opus _The Nature of Order_.\nAlexander went through these three distinct periods in which he changed his thinking considerably. Unfortunately, his most well-known books are from the earlier periods. Many ideas in them Alexander himself has deemed obsolete, and he has improved on them in more recent but less familiar works, like _The Nature of Order_.\n\nIf you want to read a little more about these periods, I recommend this article: <https:\/\/patterns.architexturez.net\/doc\/az-cf-218793|https:\/\/patterns.architexturez.net\/doc\/az-cf-218793>\n\nAnd as this turns into a “best of” I’d also add Ryan Singer’s primer: <https:\/\/vimeo.com\/491222729|https:\/\/vimeo.com\/491222729>",
