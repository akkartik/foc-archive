Money in the old sense plays a big role here since money and advertising are closely related.  Many narratives violently promoted simply reflect old and not very well reflected assumptions about money and how we grow our relationships around it.  In that sense when I'm concerned about how people talk about it in public I refer to the spaces that are very much in spirit of what we call here convivial computing and living. Computing as part of that.  Remember our discussions about cooperatives? For me web3 is simply also a space where people explore these ideas.",

Money in the old sense plays a big role here since money and advertising are closely related.  Many narratives violently promoted simply reflect old and not very well reflected assumptions about money and how we grow our relationships around it.  In that sense when I'm concerned about how people talk about it in public I refer to the spaces that are very much in spirit of what we call here convivial computing and living. Computing as part of that.  Remember our discussions about cooperatives? For me web3 is simply also a space where people explore these ideas."
