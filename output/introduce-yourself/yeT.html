Howdy folks, I'm yet, I use they them pronouns, and have been programming for a while but recently dug into the podcast cause of the Orca/100r episodes, big indieweb nerd (Elliott Cost is to blame) and I guess that world and this one are kinda a Venn diagram of sorts. Interested in generative/experimental social experience and data visualization (D3!) And urban Ag tech and racket and looking back to look forward. New to the future of coding so I will be more of a listener but I'm so glad to have found y'all :relaxed::relaxed::non-potable_water:
