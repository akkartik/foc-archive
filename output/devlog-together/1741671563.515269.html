I am in the fixing all the reactivity glitches before release stage. They are so difficult to debug, clicking a link opens a panel which syncs the hash URL, which retriggers another cell that get the stale version of the URL which may cause a cycle and the app starts flickering... or something like that.<br/><br/>I had to upgrade my <a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/ndd">in-notebook debugger </a>to work across notebooks so I can visualize the evolution of the runtime state w.r.t. time. It worked! I figured it out. Pictured is the trace of a self-triggering reactivity loop. Its still hard to understand but you can see a lot of ticks with a regular pattern, and critically, the name of the cells. There were over 1000 cells in the notebook, so knowing the 15 that were implicated in the cycle is helpful.
