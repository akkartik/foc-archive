Hi guys! My name is David, I'm from Seattle and I am about to finish my undergrad after this school year. I discovered the pod yesterday, and the FoC community seemed exactly like the kind of community I've been looking for ever since I got into PLT/xenocomputing.<br/><br/>For the past year or so, I've been working on a project called <a href="https://github.com/dabernado/iris">IRIS</a>, which is a low-level reversible programming language and virtual machine designed for efficient reversible computing. If you don't know what reversible computing is, I recommend reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing">Wikipedia page</a> - basically, it's a form of computing where every program implements its inverse, meaning that each line of code has twice the semantic utility. Via the Landauer principle, reversible computing has the potential to become WAY more power efficient than traditional computing, in the order of magnitudes!<br/><br/>My dev setup is a Thinkpad T430 running Void Linux (musl) + hikari, and one of the high-res Thinkpad X61T models which I mainly use as an e-reader. Through my experiments with Plan 9 I have gained some familiarity with the xxiivv/merveilles community, with which it seems that FoC has a lot of crossover. I'm super excited to get to know y'all and learn a thing or two!
