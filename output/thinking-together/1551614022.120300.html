It's a curious human trait that having understood a thing, it is difficult to remember the path toward understanding let alone to smooth it out for others.  Why just the other day, I was asked to help revise an abstract.  On the first reading, it was inscrutable.  By the fifth, it was completely obvious.  From there, I drew out a mind map, allowed some time for the memory of the original words, and then after three hours of reconstruction, I as pleased with story as casual as that funny thing you always tell your friends.  All this for three damn paragraphs.
