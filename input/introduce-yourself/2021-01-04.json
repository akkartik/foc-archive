        "text": "Lol, I was basically getting just-enough functionality out of the system to be able to solve the puzzles. For example, for one of the problems, I had to add Maps. Basically I finished up to Day 12 Part 1 before calling it quits, and the problems got too hard to keep up development and solving the problems at the same time, so I started using other languages.\n\nOne of the biggest bottlenecks was the type inference not being rock solid. One of the shortcuts I took was that if the editor couldn’t figure out the type, then the type resolved to “Any” which matches anything. But then the structured editor isn’t that useful because the list of autocomplete options is way too large.\n\nSooo now begins the rabbit hole of figuring out how to get a really nice type inference system. Currently investigating using VMware’s Differential Datalog engine for this...!",
