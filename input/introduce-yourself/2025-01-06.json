I'm in Finland, currently finishing up my PhD related to superconducting quantum computing.\n\nI learned to program fairly late, only during my physics studies in uni. Turns out that I love it, and I'm sure I could have learned it much earlier if it wasn't so hard to get started. So the FoC goal of making programming more accessible strongly resonates with me.\n\nI like to learn new programming languages, I've done Advent of Code with Racket, BQN (a modern variant of APL) and most recently with Pharo Smalltalk (it was great!). Another FoC-adjacent thing I like to do is making experimental-ish electronic music - I've dabbled in PureData and Supercollider, and also played around quite a bit with VCV Rack. I also sometimes like to do graphics programming (Processing and some GLSL), and I've been involved in the demoscene in Helsinki a little bit. And I of course love video games, I would like to find enough time some day to make my own.\n\nI think I was primed for FoC ideas by noticing the awful state of most of the software I see around me, especially during my PhD studies working with lab control electronics and doing science in general. At some point I came across Bret Victor's talks on HN, and I was immediately hooked. After that I've been continuously absorbing related material like Ink &amp; Switch, the local-first movement etc. After a while, I came across the podcast, and I was struck by how great it is. It has so many things I like - the interesting topics, fun banter, and the weird musical interludes and the overall off-beat format. I love it.\n\nI'm excited to see what's going on in this forum!",
