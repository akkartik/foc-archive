A more technical one for today since it seems overviews don't get much feedback :stuck_out_tongue: I implemented if/then/else on the formula editor: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4FWKy7r2TU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4FWKy7r2TU</a>

FWIW, these video demos are hard for me to interpret and give feedback on, since it's hard for me to remember the context from past videos (since, as you can imagine, there's a lot of other stuff happening in my life in between videos). It would be easier for me to read and respond to a blog post, or to play with an interactive demo. Not sure if that's why the previous video didn't get any feedback, but that's what holds me back.

I was thinking on writing a post, but the usual idea of "people don't read" holds me back at this point

also don't know what approach to take on the post, since I don't know what the reader is expecting, an overview? motivation? feature tour?

The scary thing is: that's up to you, as the author. You need to be able to figure out what will interest your audience, and make that. The reader will expect what you set up their expectations for.<br/><br/>Same deal with the video. In this case, you set it up as "I added if/then/else to my formula editor" â€” that doesn't really spark interest. I don't really need to watch a 3 minute video about that, since the title says it all.<br/><br/>I wouldn't suggest making the title more vague. Rather, I'd suggest finding a way to make your video or writing helpful, entertaining, or otherwise enticing to the reader/viewer, and to make that visible from the outside.<br/><br/>One way to do that is to ask for very specific feedback: "I added conditional logic to my expression editor. I'm wondering if it would be better to add something richer, like a Prolog-style solver, but I'm not sure that it'd work well in this interface. How do you think I should proceed?"<br/><br/>Another way to do that is to share something you've discovered: "I added if/then/else logic to my formula editor, and that led me down a rabbit hole where I found a better UI for handling conditional expressions than you normally see in a spreadsheet-like tool. I made a 1-minute video showing how the new UI works."
