Hi all! I'm When. I'm excited to participate in discussion here and share ideas. I've been a long time dreamer in what has been possible for the future of code. I've been working in software for over 20 years now and I've always been passionate about empowering people with software, especially those who don't know how to code. I have a degree in both Art and Computer Science, and the intersection between expression, intention, interface, abstraction, and usability has always been of keen interest to me. I mostly found my calling in writing tools that allow other to work at a higher level.<br/><br/>In 2007, I wrote what I believe to be the first ever "reactive javascript framework", at least in the form you see now - client-side templates, data-binding, client-side routing, components etc. I had to do a lot from scratch: module system, template compiler, fine-grained data-binding system. I've been watching the rest of the industry do it wrong ever since (I'm kidding! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:). It's still in use by the company I built it for (although I don't work there anymore), and it beat out Vue 3 + Vite in a head to head evaluation recently (from what I hear). It currently powers a loan automation system that handles billions of dollars in loans. I was never able to open source it, so I guess y'all have to take my word for it, lol. Happy to talk about it if there's anyone curious. It still has a few tricks I haven't seen in the wild. I've also built a custom workflow engine and business rules system that had a pretty unique architecture and scaled really well (over 500k rules), and actually delivered on the promise of moving a huge amount of logic into the hands of non-programmers (without needing programmers to babysit it). Those are some things I'm most proud of and have deeply informed some of the ideas that I imagine for the "future of coding".<br/><br/>My closest thing to an actual claim to fame was my involvement in the standardization of ES6. I have a name credit associated with breaking the standoff around classes. The "maximally minimal class" proposal was based off of a proposal I made.<br/><br/>These days I've been working on my own vision for the "future of coding". I'm a big fan of Alan Kay and Brett Victor. From Alan Kay, I really love the idea that we need to shift from mechanical to ecological thinking. From Brett Victor I love the concept that the "digital medium" needs a separate concept of "authors/authoring" that is separate from engineering/programming. The fact that programming languages have been a tool for both is part of what holds us back. I'm working on a unique sort of universal IR binary format inspired by DNA, and a programming/modeling language inspired by cellular biology. Happy to chat about any of this stuff, but mostly here to see what everyone else is doing! Looking forward to learning from all the brilliant minds here.
