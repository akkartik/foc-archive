(Most recently, <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/CEXED56UR\/p1743080787860049|this excellent thread>.) Some people like the name, but most seem to feel indifferent or lean negative. But we've never found a new name that people liked enough to overcome the inertial resistance to change, nor one that overcame <https:\/\/futureofcoding.org\/the-name|all the problems> with the current name. It was an impasse, with an unnerving sense that the name was mediocre, and that changing it would be good for the long-term health of the community (see also: moving off Slack), but no clear next step.\n\nThe \"Feeling of Computing\"-style of name occurred to me on April 1st. I liked it. Introducing it as a joke (_or maybe not?_) helped everyone get past their automatic dislike of change. And the reaction to it, here and elsewhere, was more positive than I expected. My (biased) read is that the majority of people liked it and felt it (or something like it) could indeed become the real name.\n\nSo I'm going to put it to the next test — let's talk about it directly as a serious candidate, not as an April Fools joke.",
