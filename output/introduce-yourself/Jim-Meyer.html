Hi all, I'm Jim :wave: I enjoy working in the space where design and code meets. I've worked directly with UX teams on design systems, but I also go way in the other direction, having worked on compilers and developer tooling like the GraphQL plugin for WebStorm.<br/><br/>Currently obsessed with making designers fall in love with code through better design tools. Latest thinking: Code should invite shaping in the same way that clay does for car designers. Design experiments with code should be visual and fun with instant feedback.<br/><br/>Have already found tons of interesting threads in here. Looking forward to many more to come :slightly_smiling_face:
