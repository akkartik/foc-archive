My bottom-line decision was, if you want to persuade academics, Jonathan _may_ be right. But that doesn't cover 10% of my desired target audience, so I didn't bother to think about it too closely.\n2. There's a lot of status tied up in there, isn't there? Makes me wonder if going to an academic conference forty years hence might be like going to the opera today. What would the equivalent of Queen in the 60s be then? I think part of it will be, \"send us stuff you've already published. Wherever, whatever format. We're just picking out an agenda to discuss in a compressed synchronous setting.\" Maybe call for attendees, _then_ call for papers?\n3. The format of a paper is excellent for a thorough exegesis of something. The process of writing it is 90% of the value of submitting to a conference for me. It forces me to think through things carefully (and no, I don't have to follow a LaTeX template). However, a) there are a lot of papers that shouldn't be papers just like there are a lot of books that shouldn't be books. There's some subjectivity here, but I suspect also some deeper thing a lot of people can agree about (if we were all willing to be so unkind out loud). Also, b) I find I can't force the paper writing process. I somehow got a PhD with a single workshop paper and no end of angst about the fact. Now it's a relief to be able to decide the time to write a paper. When the _project_ needs it, rather than my career or some funding agency's schedule. Most of the time I _don't know_ what I'm doing thoroughly enough to be able to write a paper about it. Perhaps trying to do so will advance things, but I think it has just as much chance of kneecapping them. Oh, and c) these thorough papers are explicitly discouraged at Onward, which is unfortunately coupling life cycle phase with audience.\nWait, why is there so much sand around here. Dammit, I managed to get lost in the desert again.",
