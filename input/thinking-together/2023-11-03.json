Later, the hardware was reused but each app would write it's own OS (particularly in games), then OSes would get reused but each app would write it's own UI framework, etc. Each prior stage seemed crazy from the perspective of the next because they had come to appreciate the complexity of those components enough to see reuse as the only viable approach. I think what we lack now is appreciation for the complexity of the things we currently keep rewriting which will instead be reused in the future and this is why most \"future of computing\" projects tend to be focused on ways of making it easier to rewrite the same old things over again, instead of trying to make it easier to reuse them over again.\n\nSo the problem isn't that we need super engineers that can do everything. It's that we need to accept that doing anything right is very very hard, and find ways to minimize doing it repeatedly.",

Later, the hardware was reused but each app would write it's own OS (particularly in games), then OSes would get reused but each app would write it's own UI framework, etc. Each prior stage seemed crazy from the perspective of the next because they had come to appreciate the complexity of those components enough to see reuse as the only viable approach. I think what we lack now is appreciation for the complexity of the things we currently keep rewriting which will instead be reused in the future and this is why most \"future of computing\" projects tend to be focused on ways of making it easier to rewrite the same old things over again, instead of trying to make it easier to reuse them over again.\n\nSo the problem isn't that we need super engineers that can do everything. It's that we need to accept that doing anything right is very very hard, and find ways to minimize doing it repeatedly."
