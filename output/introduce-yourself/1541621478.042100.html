Hello everyone. :wave:<br/><br/>I want to reinvent programming, or help anyone else who is, because I fear that we are squandering human achievement otherwise. Computers are the pinnacle of human invention, a universal machine, and we have locked their use behind a techno priesthood who speak arcane runes. Instead of computers becoming the bicycle of the mind we have created TV 2.0. It seems ridiculous and hugely inefficient to me that the people with domain specific knowledge need to hire others to encode that knowledge into a computer program. We should create tools to enable the domain expert.<br/><br/>I’m currently working on a bimodal visualization of React Components. Bimodal because both the visual and the textual views are first class meaning changes are propagated to the other. I’m very interested in bimodal types of programming as I feel that while text is great at expressing detail, it isn’t as effective as visuals in communicating structure and relationships. I’m limiting this tool to React Components because I’m unsure if this tool will actually be very effective and I want a well defined and small space to play in.<br/><br/>If anyone wants to grab a beer/coffee/tea in Pittsburgh, PA and talk programming just DM me.

Sad I'm not in Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>React Components seem to have quite complicated interface (they take callbacks, references to mutable objects).<br/><br/>Isn't it better to experiment on something simplier?

I’m not modeling their whole interface, just their relationships.

Which I think can be better understood visually.

While it seems ridiculous that people with domain specific knowledge need to hire others to encode that knowledge, I think it will be necessary to offer some universal education to future children - not so much the traditional stuff like the syntax of Java and how to run javac, but "computational thinking", to think a bit more logically and to learn things that are more computer friendly (e.g. the line formula is commonly taught as y = mx + b, but ax + by + c = 0 generally works better in software. Bonus points if you know why.)<br/><br/>I am a bit surprised, though, that nothing good enough to universally replace spreadsheets has caught on yet.<br/><br/>Me, I want programming to <b>be</b> reinvented, but have decided that yes, I have a bunch of seemingly unique ideas I want to contribute, but I'd prefer to work mainly on core foundations - interop and lower-level stuff - and leave some of the reputedly more fun work, like visual programming interfaces, to others.

"Web Console is an OS X application for creating and running custom plugins that wrap command line programs in web user interfaces."<br/><br/>Interesting, I have been thinking that I wanted my programming language's standard library to automatically create a UI for choosing input to the program. For example, rather than write a <tt>--help</tt> screen that says<br/><br/>    Options:<br/>    --compress:F  Compresses the file F<br/><br/>you would just express options as optional named arguments to "main" with display-attributes attached to them, to provide the label/tooltop to show in the HTML UI, like<br/><br/>    .entry main(<br/>        @label("File to compress:")<br/>        compress: opt!filename)<br/>    {<br/>      if (compress) {<br/>        // TODO: whatever it was we<br/>        // planned to do with the file<br/>      }<br/>    }<br/><br/>Then the HTML UI says<br/><br/>  :white_large_square: File to compress: [*        ▾] [Browse]<br/><br/><li> this is an empty combo box with dropdown history of the user's previous choices<br/><br/>You could of course still use the app as a command-line app, and you could still write <tt>--help</tt> to be told about the <tt>--compress</tt> option, but the handling of <tt>--help</tt> would be auto-generated based on the attributes on the parameters to the entry point.<br/><br/>My system would also show output more visually, and support multiple entry points in a single app because why should I have to create a separate app for every entry point? That's inconvenient!<br/><br/>Wrapping arbitrary cmd-line apps sounds to me like a harder problem than building the feature into the programming language / standard library... but I don't really understand what it does just by looking at the gif in the readme.
