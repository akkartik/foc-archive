That's how I see it.\n\nI think some people use it to mean \"+1\", akin to an upvote, again meant to be devoid of association with the person reacting.\n\nI would suspect most people just have a personal \/ aesthetic preference (I work with someone who is a devout :white_check_mark:-user, and I would love to see more :amiga-tick:), so *if they're the first to respond* *to something*, most people will use whatever emoji they like best, be it :thumbsup: perhaps with a skin shade, or :heavy_plus_sign:, or :point_up: \/ :ok_hand: (which, hopefully, are slowly being divorced of their alt-right-y associations), or :clap: or :tada: if some aspect of congratulation or celebration are in order.\n\nNow, if someone else has already responded, I think most people are likely to just tap whatever positive reactions are already present, even if they aren't that person's go-to emoji.",
