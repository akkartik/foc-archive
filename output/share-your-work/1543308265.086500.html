I just put up a video about PANE, a summer project which I presented at the LIVE workshop a few weeks ago: <a href="http://joshuahhh.com/projects/pane/">http://joshuahhh.com/projects/pane/</a>. It's a prototype live, functional programming environment centered around data-visibility – all intermediate values are visible by default, and you construct a program by acting on these values. Please take a look, and let me know if you have any thoughts.

Hey! UI looks quite pleasant, which is rare for prototype programming tools :smiley: I like fonts, spacing and colors very much.<br/><br/>I see that this prototype mostly works with pure functions. Do you plan to expand this idea to cover IO? It feels like it gonna require completely different interface.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Vladimir Gordeev</span> Thanks! The visual design is certainly far from ideal, but I tried to follow basic principles.<br/><br/>As for pure/non-pure functions – PANE is for defining the data-processing parts of a system, so IO isn't in scope. I've been told I'm talking about the "Functional Core" part of the "Functional Core, Imperative Shell" distinction, which sounds plausible. (Of course, the "Imperative Shell" should also be a radically visible interface.)

Thanks for posting your re-recording of your talk! I was motivated to go back and watch it after listening to the audio from Steve’s bootleg recording. What caught my ear was:<br/>1) your discussion of how it’s different from other “boxes and wires” systems<br/>2) the pragmatism of allowing linkage by name label<br/>3) the pragmatism of allowing raw JS expressions

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Joshua Horowitz</span><br/><br/>I think many of us here are on-board with the concept of being able to (finally!) see the data that we're "animating" with our functions or behaviours, so :thumbsup::skin-tone-3: to that! And so I like the corresponding switchover from functions to data as the primary entity on the UI, compared with other box-and-line IDEs.<br/><br/>Now, true logic nerds may have something to say here, but to me it seems that this system may not be Turing Complete, because it looks like you only allow pure functions between data items. This, if true, is missing a critical piece of functionality: the ability to remember past states. As I understand it, this would require either recursive function calling, or circular loops, in your diagrams. I would suggest adding circular loops, not recursion, because recursion is hard to understand and visualise.<br/><br/>On the subject raised by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Vladimir Gordeev</span> - I/O: you're not far from having it! You do have something rather I/O-like in the non-pure functions that call out to the remote API service and that call a randomisation function.  You also have I/O in the output visualisations: you could imagine building a webpage from rendered forms of output data.  And you can play with example values with the mouse, which is kind of like inputs. All you need is to wire in mouse position, buttons, textfields, etc, as your left-hand values (e.g. button up, button down as a boolean input value) and you have a completely general programming system, assuming you have added the circularity feature!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span> Thanks for your thoughts.<br/><br/>Re: Turing-completeness – The system allows recursive function calls. For one example, go to <a href="http://joshuahhh.com/projects/pane/demo/">http://joshuahhh.com/projects/pane/demo/</a> and press "square roots". There's a function there called "auto-improve guess" which calls itself, to iteratively find a good-enough square root for a number. You can press the little "[+]" to expand out the recursive calls, which is fun, but pretty unwieldy. As you mention, I think providing a visualizable "loop" construct would be more useful, and in particular I think tail recursion is a good foundation for this.<br/><br/>Re: I/O – The function which calls out to an API is a total hack, and if it had an actual side-effect, or depended on sequencing, rather than being an quasi-pure function, its behavior would be totally unpredictable. Anyway, my present stance is that PANE just isn't suited to making stateful, interactive systems, since it doesn't have visualization schemes (like timelines!) suited to seeing the behavior of stateful, interactive systems. You could try to shoehorn them in, but I think you're better off making a new interface for that kind of stuff.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Joshua Horowitz</span> - I recently realised that the main way people on this Slack will think of responding to each other's work is to compare it with their own, which would seem a little self-promoting, so maybe people don't get involved in discussions as a result?<br/><br/>That insight came about from my recent interactions with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> about the different channels, where in my mind it's not clear how you can bring everyone together to talk about this topic in general (the future of, the nature of, programming)!<br/><br/>I think there's a tendency to go abstract and have a vague conversation on general principles, without referring to our own instantiations, which ends up either unsatisfying or frustrating!

Ah - I'm sorry you got that idea from me. Definitely share about Onex here! My thought is definitely too vague and I'm working on better community guidelines now, but I was simply trying to stop people from bothering others about their own projects where they are not wanted. I'd hate to discourage people from posting their own projects where they are relevant. It's a blurry line to hold...

Turing completeness and loops<br/><br/>The pure FP solution that Pane would naturally fall into is what I see as plate-spinning: keep the functions calling and pass evolving, transformed state down and down or round and round, probably like you say with tail recursion, stream-based data types and/or Monads (whack me gently if I'm getting my Computer Science wrong here..). This has the problem that to visualise the nested state becomes very hard, as you said and as you showed in the square root example (I don't see how tail recursion really helps there, but I'd like to see your thoughts).<br/><br/>The not-fully-pure-FP solution (e.g. Onex) allows state as a first class concept and keeps the state "up at the top" where you can visualise it more easily. It can do this by allowing looping or circularity. Instead of the result of a pure function application (or the arguments of a recursive call) being new, transient, anonymous states in the call stack, your pure functions can take top-level first class state values as input, and produce new values as output, back in the top-level state they're associated with.<br/><br/>This makes visualisation much easier - and state chunks, being longer-lived and stable but evolving, can now be given unique identifiers for reference by other chunks.

Wow, this has a ton of potential. A whole new way of doing programming. But I spent about an hour trying to do some simple stuff with it and it’s pretty excruciating to use in its current state. I’d definitely be interested in playing with a somewhat more polished version of this tool.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jesse Aldridge</span> Thanks for your kind words.<br/><br/>I have to admit, your experience using the live demo makes me wonder if I should have put it online at all. PANE is /almost/ usable by me. But I have put absolutely no effort into making it usable by anyone other than me. That's because the live demo isn't intended to be the sharable product of the research – the presentation is.<br/><br/>I wanted to put the live demo online so that adventurous folk could mess with it. But now I worry that people may approach it with the wrong expectations, and waste their time or come away with what would be, in my opinion, an unfairly negative opinion of the project.<br/><br/>It doesn't sound like that was your experience. (Phew!) But I'm worried.<br/><br/>(There's another version of this set of worries for the further step of posting the source code. As you can imagine, "usability by anyone other than me" drops exponentially from "presentation" to "live demo" to "source code".)

I think posting the live demo is great. It proves that this is an actual product rather than just an idea. In fact I think you should share the source code as well even if it’s rough and hacky. Everyone understands that this is a work-in-progress.

This is very cool. I really liked how it deals with the complexity seen in the patch systems and how you can seemingly effectively break a problem down so that at each level you're only dealing with the parts relevant to that level of the program.<br/><br/>I'm curious what your plan is to add types for visualizations. If I understood correctly in the example when you enabled the vector visualization it looked for any thing with an x:number, y:number and I guess no other fields. But x:number, y:number also describes a "point". Points are different from vectors. A Point + A Vector produces another point. A Vector + a Vector produces a vector. Point + Point is an error.<br/><br/>Another example can be seen in the still for the video you have <tt>size</tt> and <tt>angle</tt> both of which are just numbers but <tt>angle</tt> could be visualized differently than <tt>size</tt>.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Gregg Tavares</span> Thanks!<br/><br/>I think there are a lot of interesting questions about how (/ if) to work types into a system like this. I agree that they could help for choosing data visualizations. You could even go all the way to a Haskell-y, type-class-y thing. On the other hand, it's worth asking: Does PANE really need types? How often do these ambiguous cases occur? How much of a problem would it be to just ask the user to disambiguate when needed?
