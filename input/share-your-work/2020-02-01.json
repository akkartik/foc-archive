I think we should be taking existing software applications and working backward to work out how to create better programming languages and development tool. So the output of a programming language is a software application, it is easy to find valuable software applications. So if we were to work backward from a collection of software applications to create new programming languages, we could measure if the new language was better or not. We could measure the number of code statements, we could estimate code complexity and development time of different languages. I feel we have the Microsoft Excel problem at the moment, we spend a lot of time arguing about different language innovations, developers in Microsoft famously got distracted by spending a lot of time talking about feature ideas they could add to Excel. Microsoft eventually solved this problem by watching people use Excel. They discovered that most of the debates they had been having were a waste of time and often of near zero value to end users. Microsoft, almost overnight, switched to assessing innovation ideas against current end user solutions. ... Interestingly, we already have current end user solutions available to us, in the form of software applications.  ...  This is a random idea I had, have not spent much time checking the feasibility. ... Thoughts, feedback welcome.",

I think we should be taking existing software applications and working backward to work out how to create better programming languages and development tool. So the output of a programming language is a software application, it is easy to find valuable software applications. So if we were to work backward from a collection of software applications to create new programming languages, we could measure if the new language was better or not. We could measure the number of code statements, we could estimate code complexity and development time of different languages. I feel we have the Microsoft Excel problem at the moment, we spend a lot of time arguing about different language innovations, developers in Microsoft famously got distracted by spending a lot of time talking about feature ideas they could add to Excel. Microsoft eventually solved this problem by watching people use Excel. They discovered that most of the debates they had been having were a waste of time and often of near zero value to end users. Microsoft, almost overnight, switched to assessing innovation ideas against current end user solutions. ... Interestingly, we already have current end user solutions available to us, in the form of software applications.  ...  This is a random idea I had, have not spent much time checking the feasibility. ... Thoughts, feedback welcome."
