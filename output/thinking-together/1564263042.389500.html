So I've been going through the "recap" podcasts and getting a good picture of where <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> has been and where he's going, and this community along with it; and I'm coming from a smaller community that formed in response to a discontinued VPRI mailing list, and attempts to collaborate, and finding other similar communities along the way, until ultimately winding up here.<br/><br/>From all I've seen, it seems that this community is the biggest most functional group of such people out there, in the realm of collaboration toward the future of coding or Kay's "computer revolution that hasn't happened yet". And in particular, where Steve has been, the connections he has / has had, the following here, his involvement with education, etc. ... It seems that Steve is very much at a center-point of all this (at least from a community/influence standpoint), and in the very fortunate position to have been where he's been and connect and that he's able to be formally researching and developing this stuff as the main focus of his time ... I don't know that there's anyone else on the planet quite in that position of ability and center of influence.<br/><br/>What I'm getting at is that it's my opinion that the best thing anyone can do for this collaborative effort / future of coding, is to enhance Steve's work &amp; influence as much as possible, and also of this community.<br/><br/>That's not to say don't work on your own stuff -- we need as many people doing that as possible! But as far as growing and empowering a community and an individual in a unique position to drive it forward -- whether personally or though his connections and influence -- I think there's enormous potential to focus/draw as much as possible to him &amp; this community. If we help Steve succeed, we help this community &amp; effort succeed.<br/><br/>It seems that perhaps Alan Kay felt the same way, yes?<br/><br/>So for example, rather than doing any further work to build up my own community from nothing, I would just direct people here. And anything we as a community can do to get Steve as much funding and sources and contacts/followers as possible, could have tremendous potential / payoff for the future of software. Seriously, he's in a very privileged position (and lucky to have some key influences &amp; friends that helped him get there).<br/><br/>Just saying, think about it

You can support Steve on Patreon here <a href="https://www.patreon.com/stevekrouse/">https://www.patreon.com/stevekrouse/</a> I know I easily get enough value from this Slack group alone to justify the cost.

That's so nice! I really appreciate the sentiment and vote of confidence! I feel very lucky to have found everyone in this community. The internet can be a magical place
