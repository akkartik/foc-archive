So this is going to be more of drive by random act of gratitude non-sequiturs smorgasbord, but I’m pretty sure y’all like overtone, and I will link, so that’s the bit right? So in all my scrubbing of recent podcast listenings and reading of show notes I forked (don’t you mean formed? No, no, there was the potential future timeline of consciousness, and this is the fork) a much deeper appreciation for the plethora of references so lovingly strewn throughout the show.<br/>This was all to no avail in locating one wild goose of a phrase saying there was renewed effort on making overtone more useable so people can do cool shit. For a while I could swear it was Ivan’s voice I heard saying it. Well, it was actually the end of a different podcast. Perhaps the wires that got crossed were FoC and HoC. The important thing is that the supercollider of my mind has been thoroughly re-patched. And for that I thank you all! Also Clojure is cool. That’s my Ideology :) <br/><br/><a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/lostinlambduhhs/episodes/arne-brasseur-tea--travel--taoism-and-HoC-e2kbq1p">https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/lostinlambduhhs/epis&hellip;</a><br/><br/>Now back to my <em>reading</em>

mentioning overtone, clojure and a reference to supercollider crossed my wires too :smile:<br/><br/>do you refer to this <a href="https://overtone.pro/">https://overtone.pro/</a> or this overtone <a href="http://overtone.github.io/">http://overtone.github.io/</a>

You're either <em>the</em> Tim Schafer or someone who I'm sure is tired of getting that a lot (this is me sheepishly probing) — either way thank you for the smile and the link.

To you sir, I posit a third possibility. I’m neither <em>the</em> Tim Schafer nor <em>that</em> Tim Schafer who tires of being  taken for one of the greats. I take it as good luck that I’m doppelgänger to someone cool! I was a backer to Double Fine Adventure, and there I opted for my full name, so it wouldn’t be read as him cheekily backing himself, lol. Honestly though it’s only come up a handful of times. True connoisseurs of the interactive digital arts are a rare breed. Or, considering the sheer number of backers to that project when they originally only asked for 200k, perhaps I just need to work on getting invited to cooler parties, heh. Regardless of our number, people that recognize the name are good company in my book. If you ever want to say you had <em>a</em> Tim Schafer on the show, I’m game, pun intended :)

Arne Brasseur has also been helping with Quil<br/><a href="https://landofquil.clojureverse.org/">https://landofquil.clojureverse.org/</a><br/><br/>And while we’re plugging Quil, might as well mention that the maker of Calva made a tutorial on getting started with Quil using Calva<br/><a href="https://blog.agical.se/en/posts/calva-quil-workflow/">https://blog.agical.se/en/posts/calva-quil-workflow/</a>

Btw the original guy behind overtone is the same guy that still makes Sonic Pi<br/><a href="https://sonic-pi.net/">https://sonic-pi.net/</a><br/><br/>My understanding is that Sam Aaron wondered off from overtone to focus on Sonic Pi because it was more approachable to beginners. Not really sure of the veracity of that statement. Regardless I was quite excited to hear that someone had taken up the reigns of overtone. Though in the context of FoC, it seems like it could make for a very interesting discussion of the tradeoffs between the two. Like is it about the language syntax, or is it a tooling factor? Also if you combined something like Vlojure with overtone would it be possible to make a UI that is even more approachable than the one Sonic Pi does?
