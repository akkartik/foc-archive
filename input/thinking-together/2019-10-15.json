He also proposes that DEC64 should be \"the only number type in the next generation of application programming languages\".

No need to wait 20 years, DEC64 is available now on github.\n\nDEC64 is a terrible idea for things like Machine Learning, and 3D graphics (both of which use GPUs). DEC64 would be a bad choice for my project, Curv, which is an end-user programming language for 3D graphics. For these applications, you need efficient binary floating point. IEEE binary floating point is an improvement over the non-IEEE floats found in some older GPU hardware: it has better numerical properties. What might be even better than IEEE FP, for ML and 3D, is \"posit\" floating point. For a given number of bits, it uses those bits more efficiently and represents a larger range of numbers which are distributed in a more effective way along the number line. Also, IMO, posit arithmetic has better numeric properties than IEEE. &lt;https:\/\/posithub.org\/docs\/BeatingFloatingPoint.pdf&gt;. Posits are *not* a drop in replacement for IEEE float (your code may need to change), and they aren't competitive unless implemented in hardware (unlike DEC64), so we may be waiting a while. They make the most sense for new ML hardware being built.\n\nFor a language like Idris, where you use dependent types to prove programs correct, you need a natural number type, Nat, which implements the Peano axioms directly. You need this so that you can perform inductive proofs over the natural numbers. You need other numeric types as well (Nat doesn't include negative numbers or fractions).\n\nIn systems languages like C, C++ and Rust, you need multiple numeric types like int8, int16, int32 and int64, so that you can write high performance code that optimizes memory consumption and memory access patterns and uses the L1 cache efficiently. Systems programming is not \"a hangover from the 70's\".\n\nIf you want to design a programming language that has only a single numeric type, and is competitive in all of these niches, then I have bad news for you.",

They make the most sense for new ML hardware being built.\n\nFor a language like Idris, where you use dependent types to prove programs correct, you need a natural number type, Nat, which implements the Peano axioms directly. You need this so that you can perform inductive proofs over the natural numbers. You need other numeric types as well (Nat doesn't include negative numbers or fractions).\n\nIn systems languages like C, C++ and Rust, you need multiple numeric types like int8, int16, int32 and int64, so that you can write high performance code that optimizes memory consumption and memory access patterns and uses the L1 cache efficiently. Systems programming is not \"a hangover from the 70's\".\n\nIf you want to design a programming language that has only a single numeric type, and is competitive in all of these niches, then I have bad news for you."

We don't bother to compile using some fancier python alternative, because it just doesn't matter. And when it comes to performance, whether you are running against SSD vs. mechanical HDD matters way more than the programming language or what compiler you used. If it takes 4 hours in plain python and 1 hour in pypy, who cares? Sure there are people with giant data sets, but how much new data does even a medium sized company generate new per day?

It eliminated many different scripting languages, and by having one main language it lowers the training cost of new employees. Even though some of our python scripts process huge data sets, we have dedicated machines for those processes, and since they are mostly batch job that run at specific times of day, we don't even care how long they take as long as they finish before the next day! We don't bother to compile using some fancier python alternative, because it just doesn't matter. And when it comes to performance, whether you are running against SSD vs. mechanical HDD matters way more than the programming language or what compiler you used. If it takes 4 hours in plain python and 1 hour in pypy, who cares? Sure there are people with giant data sets, but how much new data does even a medium sized company generate new per day? Not really that much compared to computer speeds."
