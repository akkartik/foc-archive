Hi! I'm Jan, I'm about to begin my studies of mathematics, and I've always been keen on programming and more recently on an "upgraded version" thereof. I've come to discover this community through my readings of Alan Kay's ideas, and especially the Whole Code Catalog has amazed me.<br/><br/>During the past year, I've read much about synchronization in distributed systems, symbolic AI (the work of William Byrd and others has blown my mind) and much more, and I've been thinking about general human-computer interaction, especially in the realm of programming. My dream project is an environment for a hybrid textual-graphical language, in which one wouldn't generally write text, but rather compose entities that would both <em>have</em> behaviour (in regards to development) and <em>signify</em> behaviour (in regards to the end-product).<br/><br/>Right now, I'm finalizing my final <a href="https://github.com/ruza-net/eru">high school project</a> which entails the development of a library of trace-like versioned container types. These are designed for distributed systems, since they are CRDTs. I also plan a small declarative language that uses genetic algorithms to synthesise implementation fitting a type declaration together with a test suite. I'm also interested in (homotopy) type theory, and I'm exploring the problem of constructing simplicial types inside it (recently, I started thinking about speculative typing).<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm looking forward to discussing any ideas about the future of programming (and generally computer science).
