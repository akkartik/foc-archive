I created a document <a href="https://github.com/SCP-Solution-Centric-Programming/SCP">repo on github</a> and a channel on <a href="https://discord.gg/65YZUh6Jpq">discord programming simplicity</a> for anyone interested in discussing and adding ideas...<br/><br/><a href="https://programmingsimplicity.substack.com/p/solution-centric-programming?r=1egdky">from a substack article, brainstorming SCP</a><br/>We explored how this principle led us from single-machine programming to *<b>Solution Centric Programming</b>* (SCP), which treats hundreds of small computing devices (Arduinos, sensors, actuators) as *<b>new atomic operations</b>* for automating specific problems, requiring *<b>new recipe techniques</b>* for combining them. Unlike traditional programming that forces all code through one paradigm, SCP enables *<b>computational diversity</b>* by letting each distributed node use the most appropriate programming paradigm (Forth for real-time control, Prolog for logic, FP for data processing, OOP for state management) as specialized atomic operations, while connecting them through pure data flow rather than restrictive function calls that impose control flow protocols. The key architectural insight is *<b>Solution Centric Program Choreography</b>* - a hierarchical tree structure where parent nodes contain the recipe logic for coordinating child atomic operations, eliminating peer-to-peer coupling that destroys scalability. This creates a new abstraction layer where solutions are choreographed through structured data flow between specialized atomic operations, each autonomous in their execution but coordinated through hierarchical recipes rather than lateral negotiation - representing the next evolutionary step in programming's fundamental cycle of creating atoms and recipes.
