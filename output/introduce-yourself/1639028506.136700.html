I have to confess I’ve been lurking in this group for a couple years now. Last week I listened to a couple episodes, and it inspired me to #introduce-yourself.<br/><br/>I recently founded an internal tools company (<a href="http://www.flank.cloud">www.flank.cloud</a>). It’s a standard enterprise CRUD app, nothing too crazy compared to some of the other projects here, but between the cloud, frontend frameworks, and managing environments, there’s already enough complexity that I’m wondering if we can’t build our own tools to cut through it. I’m also wondering to what extent we can use our tool to build our tool. (The answer right now is not at all.)<br/><br/>Anyway, I really enjoy dropping in here, so thanks for all the good chatter and energy that happens here. DM me if you want to chat! If you’re in Austin TX, I am too. Always up for a coffee even though I don’t drink coffee.
