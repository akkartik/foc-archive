Imagine: I could work on my text right in the university library, with all sources at hand! There was a learning curve to WordStar, but after a week I was as efficient as I ever was later with whatever other software.\n\nToday, my main writing tools is Emacs. Its org-mode has a rich choice of informal markup, i.e. markup that is not interpreted by Emacs itself but still relatively easy to process semi-automatically via keyboard macros. That's great for the use cases described in this article. The tough part is being consistent in my own use of this markup. One day I'll write a linter - one day.",

Imagine: I could work on my text right in the university library, with all sources at hand! There was a learning curve to WordStar, but after a week I was as efficient as I ever was later with whatever other software.\n\nToday, my main writing tools is Emacs. Its org-mode has a rich choice of informal markup, i.e. markup that is not interpreted by Emacs itself but still relatively easy to process semi-automatically via keyboard macros. That's great for the use cases described in this article. The tough part is being consistent in my own use of this markup. One day I'll write a linter - one day."
