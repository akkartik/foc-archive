I made a blog post about visualizing risk. <a href="https://calcwithdec.dev/posts/viz-risk/">https://calcwithdec.dev/posts/viz-risk/</a><br/>It's a scrollable explanation that develops up a visualization - a bit going on in it, a problem I have with a lot of things, so was really glad to spend time learning a few things about making this kind of scrollable interaction to more carefully introduce things.<br/><br/>Behind the scenes, the numbers are from a calculang model doing monte carlo simulations on a pension calculator calculang model. This composability (or what I call flexibility) is something I decided not to make <em>this</em> post about, but it's an important part of why calculang exists.<br/>I plan to do a few similar separate exercises, and then spin back to this on it's own. (e.g. next: benchmarking actual results to their older estimates)<br/><br/>So, this blog post isn't really technical, but I hope it's interesting or at least easy to follow, and it fits into a longer piece about calculang. Happy if you have any feedback about the post or questions about this longer piece!
