Good morning and hello all. My name is Jason Priestley, I'm a bay area software developer. I have one big idea for the future of software. It's hard to describe because it either sounds vague or trivial or incomprehensible depending on how I describe it, so I'll describe it in a few ways, and perhaps the sum will give a better sense of things.<br/><br/>My idea is to unify programmer and user. Seen from the programmer's side, this means an IDE that provides the discoverability and rich graphical UI that user's enjoy. Seen from the user's side, this means that their walled-garden "apps" are now part of one big app, they are unknowingly editing code by clicking buttons, and there is a smooth transition between graphical UI and code.<br/><br/>My idea is to bring the Lisp REPL into the graphical era. Read and Print are text-based primitives. The modern equivalent is a graphical UI that can extend and edit itself. The extension method may resemble Reader macros, but instead of taking over Read at certain syntax, it takes over the whole UI.<br/><br/>My idea is to make data into code. Lisp made code into data - a function declaration is also a linked list. Data into code means that whenever you are operating on data - editing a TODO list say - you are literally editing code in one big program. Editing your TODO list is a specialized UI that does the exact same thing as opening the TODOs variable in your code editor and typing out your changes manually.<br/><br/>My idea is to make a universal editor. Instead of one editor and many apps you have one editor that can be changed and customized to take on any behavior.<br/><br/>My idea is to complete the idea behind Emacs. People joke that Emacs is an OS, that you can do anything in Emacs. I take these jokes seriously. An extensible editor should be our OS, but emacs is too ad-hoc and too tied to text buffers to really suffice. Emacs, but the primitive operations are more low-level UI constructs, and graphical from the start.

Sent this accidentally before finishing. One last summary. My idea is a structure editor that operates on a unified database of code, shared by all users. The structure editor is written to be highly extensible by the basic operation of matching on syntax and taking over the UI at that point. Users can register syntax-editors, share them etc. They range from the simplest color picker up to potentially, a full graphical UI. More likely, the superior interoperability provided by this architecture would lead to smaller, more focused bits of UI that would be mixed-and-matched ... today's heavy, monolithic UIs would disappear

I haven't used smalltalk myself. I think it more or less fulfills the idea of a universal editor but I'm not sure it's a good one. I think OO programming is generally too loose, the UI abstractions from OO aren't very composable.

Lamdu, while at the moment more focused on lower level “real programming”, also shares the same idea in our “grander vision”..<br/><br/>To put it into different terms with an example - suppose that a user is editing a video - instead of using an opaque application Final Cut etc, they’ll be editing in a similar video timeline UI, which is just a domain-specific syntax-sugar for calling the appropriate video editing combinator. But an important part of any such projectional syntax sugar is that it doesn’t limit you and allows you also, if you wish, to also perform edits that change the code to anything really, even if it no longer fits the timeline pattern.. So that this timeline-like interface is for concatenating a bunch of videos in a literal list, and then the user wants to concatMap the list so that each video repeats twice - then they could do that but it just won’t have the timeline interface anymore, unless someone creates a sugar for that more complicated pattern too.<br/><br/>But to do that, I think that we need to start with a good ground to stand on. That’s why we’re starting with the more lower-lever programmingy stuff.<br/><br/>IIUC Unison also has this in their grand vision, which is kind of what Paul Chiusano refers to when he talks about “UX derived from type theory”. And so Hazel too probably shares the same vision.

&gt;  IDE that provides the discoverability<br/>Yep—current IDEs could do a much better job here!<br/>&gt; Data into code means that whenever you are operating on data - editing a TODO list say - you are literally editing code in one big program.<br/>This is called “programming by demonstration”. It has pros and cons. The hard bit is “inference”: figuring what abstract operation the user intended by the single demonstrated example. DM me if you want a reference list. At the most basic level you can just dump a list of commands in order to a file (like a bash history) and not try to be smart, but these sorts of programs are not the highest quality. In Sketch-n-Sketch we’ve been playing around with an output-directed refactoring approach, but it’ll take some work to generalize that to general purpose programs. (c.f. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JcKnJyufD8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JcKnJyufD8</a>)<br/>&gt; My idea is a structure editor that operates on a unified database of code, shared by all users.<br/>I understand this is also <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Cyrus Omar</span>’s vision for Hazel (<a href="http://hazel.org/">http://hazel.org/</a>). He uses the term “Wikipedia” of code where everything is editable by everyone.<br/>&gt; The structure editor is written to be highly extensible by the basic operation of matching on syntax and taking over the UI at that point. Users can register syntax-editors, share them etc.<br/>Agreed! My current understanding is that the matching might be better done by types, actually. Hazel is moving in this direction, I believe.<br/>&gt; An extensible editor should be our OS<br/>Agreed! OSes need revisiting—they don’t provide good enough interfaces between disparate code elements.<br/>&gt; today’s heavy, monolithic UIs would disappear<br/>We can hope! But I don’t think “everything is code” gets you all the way there. Even within a single language, there’s a big interface problem between software components and you’ve got to have a story for that. The problem is that it’s hard to (a) understand what kind of data the other source provides, (b) figure out the API to get it, and then (c) mangle the data into the form you need it.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Brian Hempel</span> I'm a little bit familiar with programming by example, I don't think it's the same thing I'm going for. If you're editing a TODO list then you'd be editing some syntax like <tt>[{name: "get milk"}, {name: "change motor oil"}]</tt>. It would be a UI wrapper over the operation of manually typing in a list literal. There's no step of inferring a function from this input.<br/><br/>Actually I think I'm in a minority here, I think that ordinary programming languages provide a reasonable way to write logic. I don't really want to replace that kind of activity with drag-and-drop or spreadsheet interfaces or anything.<br/><br/>I've thought about overloading editors based on type; syntax makes more sense to me right now. I think I'd rather edit, say, <tt>take 5 (iterate succ 1)</tt> as textual syntax, but <tt>[1,2,3,4,5]</tt> could be manipulated with a list control.<br/><br/>Thanks for the pointer to Hazel, I hadn't run across it before.

Yeah we haven’t communicated our vision and plans as much as Unison or Hazel.<br/>Since I first saw <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span>’s subtext videos in 2005 and was subsequently excited about ideas of how programming should be, my fellow leet colleagues were quite skeptical when discussing such stuff, so our approach tended more towards programming something and then talking/demoing what we’ve already implemented.<br/><br/>But the not-as-discussed vision is very consistent with both Unison and Hazel. Even the differences with Lamdu that Hazel highlights, like Lamdu stopping evaluations on holes while Hazel resumes are not differences in vision but just in what we have got to implement so far.

right now in the Hazel project, we're working on 0) scaling up to an Elm/ML-like language; 1) "live palettes", i.e. UIs that generate code underneath to fill holes and that have access to dynamic information and 2) a semantics for collaborative editing using CRDTs

It seems like the biggest difference between my approach and both Hazel and Lamdu is that I'm not envisioning a type system as an integral component of the editor. I might add a type system but I think the main concepts I'm after could be put on top of untyped lisp or similar.<br/><br/>That said there seems to be a lot of overlap. "computational Wikipedia" is a great metaphor. I'm also working on collaborative editing with operational-transform, which I think is sort of just CRDTs through a different lens.

static types enable a lot of nice edit-time automation at various scales. if you don't want to write types, Hazel has type-level holes (and we're adding type-hole-inference soon)

and if you go for the structural editor approach anyway, then you can have a much nicer UX for types.

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jason Priestley</span>, I think I'm working on much the same thing as you initially describe, and I think we even share some if the same views (or implementation choices) as far as dynamic types, using Lisp (or similar) as an underlying model, UI interaction as "sugar" for code manipulation, extending the idea of "macros"/REPL into the UI, a UI that can extend and edit itself, etc.<br/><br/>We should talk more, and exchange thoughts

I think the differing opinions/choices (e.g. static or dynamic types) on otherwise similar projects/goals, is a great opportunity to see how different branches of similar ideas play out.<br/><br/>Hopefully we get different end results / capabilities that will give us more value than we'd have by collectively commiting to only one. (Because, individually we've got to commit to specifics, and can't see where else we'd have ended up)

So you too pick a red one? Welcome, aboard!<br/><br/>Meta question: How does it feel to get flood of responses like "Heyy it's pretty much I am working on."?<br/>It's quite fascinating how similar conclusions people get more or less independently.<br/><br/>-Consider is it code editor where the code is also data or is it "just" a data editor where the code is one possible domain (I prefer last one).<br/>    -I am really excited about empowering users for more complex use cases with Unix like reusable tools where classic GUIs are not powerful enough.<br/>    -A dream from an application developer point of view would be that you just describe part of your API and you would get super powerful UI cheaply.<br/>-I think some typing is required and for free data editing, I think it shouldn't be nominal.<br/>-One of my current problems is that what should a code execution look like? You can show a representation of computation result (diagram, SmallTalk GUI) and look for specific element and code behind it or the complete opposite where you can see partial results inside of your code. Or something completely different? You sided this slightly with REPL but it's pretty vague.<br/>&gt; Read and Print are text-based primitives. The modern equivalent is a graphical UI that can extend and edit itself.<br/>So unsolved problem(?), all ideas are welcome.

Dear Jason, Okay i see from the later responses you imagine a tree format. Not sure why you mentioned emacs. Emacs is a disaster for ordinary users. Plenty of people had  Emacs available for free, they threw it aside the minute they got to see WordStar, WordPerfect, MS Word, etc. for text editing, because 99.999% of people will never write a Lisp program in their text editor. Look at Postscript; it is a domain specific language that perfectly describes static pages, but never really handled colored font rendering well, and is not convenient at all for graphical interactive work because it lacks an event model. Most applications do not need dynamic code. 99.99% of mobile apps have no dynamic code, and they work just fine. Dynamic code is painful to debug, and the more dynamic the language, the more skill and restraint it requires. Emacs is un-ergonomic, and would lose against almost any other editor you can mention in an A-B comparison preference test with new users. Why build a cathedral on a mud pit? Sorry to be the splash of cold water, but ask yourself, why would George RR Martin, who is very rich, still be using WordStar? Was it the convenience of the CTRL-S, CTRL-D,  keys etc. to move the cursor, so that one never leaves the home row? The ergonomics of WordStar were tremendous, and no product since can beat it for simple typing input. Really since programming is a human task, study the masterworks of the past, things that were beloved and insanely popular in their day, rather than some elitist tool that Project Mac at MIT was so fond of.

Feels great to get all this feedback. Most people I've talked to about this don't understand what I'm getting at. It's super exciting to see other people with similar vision.<br/><br/>I'm by no means opposed to static types, but for my prototype I'm trying to cut out any work that isn't essential to embodying my vision and static types don't make the cut. They seem to considerably complicate structure editing and the specific benefits I'm after don't rely on them. That said, I agree that there are considerable synergies between type systems and structure editing, so I can see how that could be a core component of some of your projects.<br/><br/>Niko your point about getting a UI from an API is a really good one and gets at part of the core value of my approach. Suppose I write a library and API for image editing. The user gets nothing from this. To expose the API to the user I have to do additional work for every object and function in the UI.<br/><br/>In my system, the user can immediately use the whole API. The UI can be specialized gradually to add more friendly interactions, like dragging to create a rect. Think of how in emacs, the generic text-editing interface lives alongside buffers that are specialized to show a bespoke UI with specific commands, e.g. magit.<br/><br/>Edward a few points. First of all I appreciate the critique. A few points. First of all code in my system is not text but trees, and since any data format can be encoded in a tree you could write MS Word in my system if you wanted to. However I do see people writing much less monolithic apps in my system, and bringing the ui muh closer to an IDE in many ways, so this does not really invalidate the body of your critique.<br/><br/>First time users and casual users will never want powerful software and should not be forced to use it. They aren't the target audience for my system, if everyone switches to my system I imagine they will still be using bespoke UIs per task with little hint that they are editing code (my system can perfectly well embed such experiences). The target for my system is the "power user" ranging up to the programmer.<br/><br/>Now if you look at the activities of such power users, in apps like photoshop, word, or excel, they are in fact spending a lot of their time on the manipulation of abstract data. For example, layer management and smart objects in photoshop, track changes, macro and template systems, formulas in excel, files and sheets ... this is all like a pidgin programming language, but built up inside each program at enormous cost, following no overall principles, and lacking interoperability.<br/><br/>I don't disagree that crafted, graphical interactions are vastly superior to old-school UI like emacs, and beloved for good reason. I neither want to force users to code or force programmets to drag-and-drop etc. Where I want to change things is the user-programmer dynamic. Right now you have your nice WIMP interface to edit you document, and if something isn't covered in that interface then you call up a programmer, who opens the same program in an entirely different interface, adds the feature almost blindly to the interface, compiles it and sends you a new version. In my system you would first of all already be able to do your new task by dropping down into a lower level of the interface; and then you could save that code into the program in the same interaction.

One more thought on the API/UI connection. The API always impacts the UI, the notion of the "hidden implementation details" are a bit of a myth. But with my system the two become almost identical. So this is one reason that so much of my work on this is trying to get the UI library, persistence library etc. to have great APIs. If I'm just exposing git, sql, HTML/CSS to the user then this isn't going to be able to show the advantages of the overall approach very well

cc <span style="background-color:#ccf">@David Piepgrass</span> now that I notice the emphasis on interoperability. We're both interested there.<br/><br/>It sounds like your approach is best suited to domains that have obvious visualizations, particularly UIs and graphics, but perhaps also sound. Do you care about how the great APIs you mentioned are arrived at? Is that with your ideal system, or do you assume they're built outside your system?<br/><br/>One problem the current stack struggles with is the proliferation of languages within even text-based programs. As a programmer building something much simpler than the sort of thing you're envisioning, I often find myself needing to know many different languages, each with their own syntax and semantics. Often I'm learning these on demand, and discovering the depths of my ignorance at the worst possible time. I think your system will also have this problem. Do you disagree or have a sense for how your more powerful UI will avoid this problem? It feels like precious experience available to learn from.

Yeah so the current system is a mess. It's just a shambles honestly. The amount of stuff you're supposed to learn to build a simple application is staggering.<br/><br/>I don't think this is a tooling problem and I don't think that my tool will solve it. Simpler systems have been built, they've failed in the market. It's really an economic problem - good code comes from shared efforts, profits come from walled gardens. I have ideas for how to fix this as well, which would get into the details of what a "wikipedia for code" would mean and who would pay for it, but it's not the focus of my current efforts (it's a lot harder to prototype and prove an economic system with limited personal resources versus a programming system)<br/><br/>Still, if I expose the awful complexity of application programming to the user, no matter how slick my packaging, then this will be a non-starter; so I'm left having to build some kind of simple and comprehensible alternative to the current tangle.

I totally agree with all that, particularly the problem of walled gardens being more profitable and therefore more adaptive.<br/><br/>But I'm still left feeling you haven't answered my questions. Will your system support (only in principle) building the "back end" for itself? Ignore the recursion. Will your system in principle support building a system as complex as itself, including all of the back end?<br/><br/>(I tend to implicitly assume that the back end of a system is sized like the underwater part of an iceberg. Do others agree?)

My system would not be capable of building itself, no. Much as a programming language is written in C or assembly, my system will be written using existing programming tooling; it will attempt to be "complete" in the sense that any particular interaction you want to construct is possible (like you can write any program in a high-level language), but I'll be choosing usefulness and coherence over completeness where they conflict. I'll also be trying to "bootstrap" as much of it as possible so that the amount of the system that can't be introspected and modified is kept at a minimum.

You might be able to achieve 100% bootstrapping with a built-in compiler (JIT or otherwise). Initially, you create your tool as you are now; but then you create the equivalent code/representation inside itself, and a way to regenerate the machine-runnable code from it.<br/><br/>And if you can find a way to wrap/nest low-level generated code in the high level structure of your tool, and if you can add that wrapping to the actual running program (either initially or at startup), then your actual running tool is just one of various other user-accesible components in the tool. You can then change the high-level code from within, compile it to generate a second copy, and then just delete the first -- all at runtime.<br/><br/>(This is the approach I'm taking with my tool)

It's far from complete or demo-able for what it's ultimately supposed to do, and progressing slowly (life is busy). It's actually 2 projects.<br/><br/>The first one started with the bootstrapping, interpreter, and compiler, and left the UI as an afterthought. I got most of the way through recoding it in itself before hitting complications that made it hard to keep going:<br/><br/><a href="https://github.com/d-cook/Objects">https://github.com/d-cook/Objects</a><br/><br/>The second one is starting with the UI and working downward. It's partly a redo of the first from a different angle, but also an experiment for a specific UI model of programming:<br/><br/><a href="https://github.com/d-cook/Interact">https://github.com/d-cook/Interact</a><br/><br/>I may stitch these two projects back together some day, but for now I consider Interact to be "it".<br/><br/>There's not much to see in the UI just yet, but I've laid out my plans &amp; consideration in the form of "issues". Also, the UI is intentionally crude to begin with. The idea is to get a fully working model first, and then explore options to improve or alter it -- using the UI itself to do so.

Okay i see better your approach. Very hard to comment without an example. I get triggered by people who marvel at Emacs or Lisp, both ancient technologies that follow no ergonomic principles, and were products of a priesthood mentality which kept programming a tiny field. I can remember the academics refusing to publish algorithms in a language in actual common use (they all published in Algol) so nobody outside the priesthood could learn, and also they used languages like LISP and arcane editors like Emacs which forced you to use lisp to do find/replace. We now share running code, and with YouTube tutorials we have 20 million active programmers instead of 20 thousand

Edward, I understand what you mean! Bad usability / presentation is what is driving many of us to try to make things better. What I've described above is not the end goal, it's just the required mechanism to create a tool that can customize itself to <b>become</b> whatever is the best tool or representation for a whatever you want to use it for.<br/><br/>The idea is not for something Lispy to be what's actually presented. That's just a good structure for storing and data representation. I actually think if it more like JSON.<br/><br/>The idea is to be able to say "for this given code or data, draw this (perhaps very different) UI".

One major difference between my two projects is that the second (Interact) keeps a history: every edit or manipulation is saved as an "action". Any change causes everything to be recomputed by reapplying all actions in order. Code is made of actions, so there is zero difference between user interaction and "programming", and it's like the program is in constant debug-mode as you edit it.

interesting how all these approaches end up covering such similar ground. My current prototype incorporates an ordered sequence of atomic changes as well, mainly to enable distributed and offline programming. I'll look further into Interact soon, and hopefully I can show the group my own prototype in the coming weeks.
