<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Gregg Tavares</span> I’m optimistic that we will leave behind the desktop/laptop form factor and find better ways of communicating with our technology, partly through becoming that technology ourselves. I agree that even the latest current smartphones do not provide a better experience, but within the next five years we will learn how to use our hands, eyes, and voice in more and more effective ways to interact with our technology that will make us look back on keyboards with the same nostalgic feeling that we today look back on punching holes into cards to tell computers what to do. I know that’s very hard to believe right now, but it was very hard to believe just ten years ago that we are carrying more powerful computers in our pockets than we then had on our desks.
