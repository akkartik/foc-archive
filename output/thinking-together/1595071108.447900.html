The sources for Interlisp-D, along with an emulator, are finally becoming available under an open license:<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/17LkdOmdRtuZmvxS4flAf14Kl7oWmVTuimtyRSebxk4M">https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/17LkdOmdRtuZmvxS4flAf&hellip;</a><br/><br/>This is of interest because the people who worked on this system were very, very bright and early to many of the things we're still talking about (for example, this is the context in which UNDO/REDO, DWIM, and structural editing were invented). A large portion of the work that went into Interlisp was done at Xerox PARC, and there was a great deal of cultural and intellectual interchange with the team responsible for Smalltalk, &amp;c.
