Finally, finished my most recent article (and published a package): <a href="https://kizu.dev/preview-mixin/">https://kizu.dev/preview-mixin/</a> — a lot of overcomplicated CSS, but one that makes it much easier to debug various dynamic values. For now, it is mostly for displaying them as text when possible, but I have a few ideas about some other visualizations. I already used it for a few experiments — and <em>seeing</em> the values of what you're working on in real time really helps.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Roma Komarov</span> This is super interesting. I've encountered this problem several times and more than once I resorted to drawing the element, then using JS to get its size.<br/><br/>I'll have your mixin in mind next time this problem resurfaces in my radar.<br/><br/>BTW, the visual style of your article (and your homepage in general) is outright gorgeous. It feels like looking at art!
