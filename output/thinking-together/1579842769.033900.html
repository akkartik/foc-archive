<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Doug Moen</span> Javascript is way more directly related to Actionscript 2 and its predecessors than Self. If you look at the libraries for AS2 you can see JS copied the weird quirk of the date function that months start with 0 for january. Javascript is #1 not because of merit, but because dictators like Steve Jobs issued an edict from on high that JS was the only interpreted language permitted in their all important IOS universe and in their browsers. I admit that the V8 engine is one of the marvels of the modern software world; an interpreted language that is within spitting distance of the speed of a highly optimized compiled language, but that doesn't change the fact that JS was hardly designed to be the main programming language for millions of programmers, and carry billions of lines of codes. Its module system is a bungled subset of AS3, and i won't bore you with the myriad other problems of JS. My favorite is that adding a string accidentally into an expression can cause type changes all the way up the call chain, wreaking havoc. Part of the poor quality of modern software can be traced to flabby languages like JS.  I would not call Lua a derivative of Self. Lua was developed independently at the Catholic University in Rio, Brasil. I don't see anything in Self that survived, which is why i call it a dead end.  It was yet another Xerox Parc project that never got commercialized properly. One can argue that Xerox had the worst ratio of ideas commercialized divided by ideas invented, basically near zero. They should make all tech managers watch some kind of training film showing the repeated stupidity of the managers who basically forced their employees to leave and start companies, many of which are way bigger than Xerox. (Xerox has market cap of 8 billion, Adobe 170 billion for example).
