Hi all! Longtime follower and recent contributor on the “robust first” computing effort with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dave Ackley</span>. My background is working in the industry on large software systems. I’m determined to build life-like robustness into a new computing stack. As a concrete analogy: I like to think of how primitive cellular functions build upon each other to achieve higher level goals. This could be similar to how traditional software functions are composed today. The best part is we get to start from scratch. Removing billions of years of cruft :-) we can build crisp and predictable functions with good reuse. That’s part of the fun and challenge of this work, and we’re definitely still at the beginning. Would love to get to know you all and answer questions!<br/><br/>Edit: I hang out in: #robust-computation and <a href="http://gitter.im/t2tile/">http://gitter.im/t2tile/</a> is where most of the real work happens.
