In terms of experimental development tooling, I put out a VSCode extension a little while ago that focuses on mapping conceptual interactions with Vuejs + TailwindCSS into a few semantic keystrokes through AST manipulation. I don't have a video, but the README has a few GIFs showing it in action. The CSS interaction cycle seems to me to be somewhat novel, though underdeveloped.<br/><a href="https://github.com/cameronrking/olympus">https://github.com/cameronrking/olympus</a>

I have just tried it, and I like it! I like the "vim" like way of executing the command: Alt-o to launch the extension, then 'a' to add, then 'p' for props, then the prop name, and voilà you have un new prop at the right place even if you are far away this place. Combined with the autodiscovery, I find that all this gives a good developer experience.

For the Tailwind part, I find that there is no real plus compared to the existing Tailwind CSS that can already help you finding the right class name with auto complete. I guess for this it is a matter of preference as the experience is slightly different:<br/>• well chosen char sequences for you with autodiscovery<br/>• start typing, auto-completion is showing, select with up/down for Tailwing extension.

I know you won't maintain this extension, but I wanted to let you know that it seems that the extension works well only for 4 spaces tab stops. I use 2 spaces tab stops and after an insertion (say a new props) it uses 4 spaces for the insert and in some other places.

And a remark, this extension is very useful to add data, computed, watchers, etc. with the traditional way of coding this in Vue. But with the new Vue Composition API, maybe it will be more complicated for this extension to add/modify stuff (which can be anywhere in the setup function as JavaScript code) ?

1. Yes, that vim-like feel is what I was going for.<br/>2. I agree, I think the discovery portion of the CSS isn't much of a change. What really stands out to me, though, is the elimination of the reload and the family navigation mechanic. What I was striving for as I built it was being able to press a single key to iterate through my options without any feedback delay and without having to manually copy changes from the browser back to the source. The shortcut mechanism was intended more for experienced developers who know what they want and want to reduce the number of keystrokes required to say it.<br/>3. Yes, the 4-space formatting is intentional. Since it's a prototype, I hard-coded my formatting preferences rather than making them modifiable. But in my defense, it wouldn't be an issue if the AST were a first-class member of the development process. Ideally, I should be able to hand the AST directly to an independent formatter. As it stands, it was easier to rely on the existing integration of formatters/linters into the workflow than to try to integrate those tools directly into the extension or expose the recast printing options. The HTML printer also does some weird stuff with multiple attributes if you haven't noticed that yet.<br/>4. The composition API would make life more interesting, but it's intended for more challenging use cases. I haven't had to design anything quite that complicated, so I have no mental models for the process. I wouldn't know what tooling to build, but I suspect it would be closer to a projectional editor than this "smart snippets" thing.

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Cameron King</span>, this looks great! Are you able to go a bit deeper into the technical details of how you achieve liveness? I'm familiar with ASTs but not with Vue or Tailwind, if that helps.

Sure! I'm not sure what you mean by "liveness", but if you're referring to the CSS feedback cycle, the details aren't particular to the technologies.<br/><br/>1. To skip waiting for the project to rebuild, the extension opens a WebSocket connection between the editor and the browser. To start the connection, the user has to drop a snippet into their <tt>main.js</tt> they get through the extension command <tt>alt+o ss</tt>.<br/>2. Through that connection, the extension sends <tt>edit-class</tt> events, which target an element with a specific <tt>data-olympus</tt> attribute and add/remove the given classes on it.<br/>3. The <tt>data-olympus</tt> attribute is added to the source code of a given component via an extension command (<tt>alt+o ai</tt>)<br/>4. In the editor, rather than editing class lists directly, the user goes through an input that's summoned by an extension command (<tt>alt+o et</tt>). Every time the user adds/removes a class, the extension patches the classes on the corresponding AST node and reprints the source, and sends an event through the WebSocket with the appropriate payload.<br/>It could be more elegant and efficient. Editing through the AST isn't necessary, but it was quicker development-wise to work with objects and call <tt>.toString()</tt> than to work with locations in the underlying string representation. I'm also not a fan of the <tt>data-olympus</tt> attribute, but it was the quickest way to map identity between AST nodes and live DOM nodes. Neither do I love that the user has to drop a snippet into their source code, but it didn't feel worth publishing an NPM package to hide the snippet. Ideally, the snippet would be part of the build system and included/excluded based on the environment.

Got it, that's perfect, thank you. Yes, by liveness I meant as in live coding or on-the-fly programming.
