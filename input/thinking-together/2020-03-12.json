        "text": "Thanks for those suggestions, Edward. What's cool is that some of the things you've suggested are things I'm already doing! For instance, the part of the engine that schedules evaluation and rendering tasks will use feedback from each task to decide what minimal amount of dependent work needs to be done. That helps avoid needless rendering (which is currently HTML, SVG, and WebGL all intermingled, so I do need to be careful about layout, paint, and composite — especially since my frame budget is &lt; 8ms so I can maintain 120fps).\n\nThe specific thing that I'm finding tricky is, in short, that there is a certain experience I want to be able to offer the programmer, and that requires being able to visualize execution in a really rich way, and that means I'm only able to design programming semantics that are sufficiently visualizable. The matrix of programming semantics is the 1000 piece clock — the existence of certain semantics can enable, or prevent, other semantics from being viable, and I want to have the minimal possible set of core semantics. Each new concept I introduce needs to be mapped to some visual characteristic, and the more of that I do, the less room I leave for people to define their own visual meanings (this is an art tool first and foremost).

The capabilities I'm missing are: ordering\/sequencing (eg: building arrays, or calling a function with arguments in a certain order) and storage (eg: variables, databases, lookup, query, etc). I'm sure I'll be able to get them, I just need to be able to explore ideas for those things while keeping in mind (A) all the existing semantics, (B) all the semantics I've tried and ruled out, (C) the things all those semantics either enabled or prevented on their own, and (D) all combinations thereof. I could easily decompose this into smaller problems if I wanted to somehow ignore or isolate semantics so there aren't all the combinations and interactions, but I don't.",

For instance, the part of the engine that schedules evaluation and rendering tasks will use feedback from each task to decide what minimal amount of dependent work needs to be done. That helps avoid needless rendering (which is currently HTML, SVG, and WebGL all intermingled, so I do need to be careful about layout, paint, and composite — especially since my frame budget is < 8ms so I can maintain 120fps).\n\nThe specific thing that I'm finding tricky is, in short, that there is a certain experience I want to be able to offer the programmer, and that requires being able to visualize execution in a really rich way, and that means I'm only able to design programming semantics that are sufficiently visualizable. The matrix of programming semantics is the 1000 piece clock — the existence of certain semantics can enable, or prevent, other semantics from being viable, and I want to have the minimal possible set of core semantics.

        "text": "I’ve been trading emails with Alan Kay for a few days about CS education. Wanted to share a few thought-provoking snippets with y’all:\n\n&gt; In my research group at Parc in the decade of the 70s, we did four major “real object” languages, about three more major designs, and many versions. This is because “what was actually needed” was not a variation on any of the several thousand languages that Jean Samet was able to count by the late 60s. Other research groups at Parc accounted for another 4 or 5 higher level languages and SDKs as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Part of the mental tool set for being a “aspirational computer scientist” back then was to know how to make OSs, languages, and new whole computers in a timely fashion. Today it is much easier than back then, but most computer people don’t know how, and don’t.\n&gt; \n&gt; What seems to be lacking is what we used in order to get most of “personal computing” into an Alto in the 70s in about 10,000 lines of code including the OS with all but a few thousand instructions written in the super high level language -- and all done by less than 10 people (who also had to invent the personal computing ideas and GUI, etc). The secret sauce was a kind of mathematics and design that seems quite missing today combined with an integrated live programming language, live development environment, and hardware all built to support the math and design.\n&gt; \n&gt; For “CS” learning purposes, just bootstrapping a neat system done by others is probably not the best first experience. But this is an indication that a very large “personal computing experience” can indeed be programmed in a few thousand lines of code via what really counts in computing: *Design not bricklaying* or “Runnable Math*\n&gt; \n&gt; A separate “real CS” department -- maybe it should be called “The Systems Sciences Department” for clarity -- would address all these deeper issues.",

This is because “what was actually needed” was not a variation on any of the several thousand languages that Jean Samet was able to count by the late 60s. Other research groups at Parc accounted for another 4 or 5 higher level languages and SDKs as well.\n\nPart of the mental tool set for being a “aspirational computer scientist” back then was to know how to make OSs, languages, and new whole computers in a timely fashion. Today it is much easier than back then, but most computer people don’t know how, and don’t.\n\nWhat seems to be lacking is what we used in order to get most of “personal computing” into an Alto in the 70s in about 10,000 lines of code including the OS with all but a few thousand instructions written in the super high level language -- and all done by less than 10 people (who also had to invent the personal computing ideas and GUI, etc). The secret sauce was a kind of mathematics and design that seems quite missing today combined with an integrated live programming language, live development environment, and hardware all built to support the math and design.\n\nFor “CS” learning purposes, just bootstrapping a neat system done by others is probably not the best first experience. But this is an indication that a very large “personal computing experience” can indeed be programmed in a few thousand lines of code via what really counts in computing: *Design not bricklaying* or “Runnable Math*\n\nA separate “real CS” department -- maybe it should be called “The Systems Sciences Department” for clarity -- would address all these deeper issues."

Decompose and recompose the human model, and there's your code model!\n\nBut most (enterprise) code bases are so far from that. You have to trace all over the code to reverse engineer an understanding (in human terms) of what the system is &amp; what it does. Instead, that stuff is supposed to \"emerge\" from a bunch of separate components. So the decomposition of the system is typically far removed from what the system is even for \/ about.\n\nIf software people get a handle on that, then a lot of that complexity just becomes translating straight from English to code. And then the design difficulty has very little to do with code; it's all about how to design a good user model, which is more on the side of business \/ user experience than on anything technical.",

Sure, good design can be hard; but it's made much harder and more complicated than it needs to be; which I think is because most software developer don't understand what software is really about: not mechanism and patterns and frameworks, but human value! Decompose and recompose the human model, and there's your code model!\n\nBut most (enterprise) code bases are so far from that. You have to trace all over the code to reverse engineer an understanding (in human terms) of what the system is & what it does. Instead, that stuff is supposed to \"emerge\" from a bunch of separate components. So the decomposition of the system is typically far removed from what the system is even for \/ about.\n\nIf software people get a handle on that, then a lot of that complexity just becomes translating straight from English to code. And then the design difficulty has very little to do with code; it's all about how to design a good user model, which is more on the side of business \/ user experience than on anything technical."
