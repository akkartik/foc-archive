But their special counting words are all decimal numbers multiplied by powers of two, which are 1, 2, 4, 8 … . Specifically, _takau_ equals 10; _paua_ equals 20; _tataua_, 40; and _varu_, 80. Those big numbers are useful for keeping track of collections of valuable items, such as coconuts, that come in large numbers. Bender and Beller realized that <http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1073\/pnas.1309160110|the Mangarevan counting system makes it possible to use binary arithmetic for calculations of large numbers>, they report today in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_ in a paper that even nonexperts will enjoy reading.\n<https:\/\/www.science.org\/content\/article\/polynesians-may-have-invented-binary-math>",
