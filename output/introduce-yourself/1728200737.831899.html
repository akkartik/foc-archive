Hi all.<br/>My name is <a href="https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/">Thomas van Binsbergen</a> and I am an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam. I teach programming languages, programming concepts, compilers and software evolution. My research is on software language design, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and programming environments. Java and Haskell are my native languages, and I very much used to be a back-end code kinda guy. Nowadays I hardly code anymore, except for the occasional interpreter, and spend my time engrossed in mathematical abstractions and inference rules (the word <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> was looking for in one of the podcasts), e.g., writing formal operational semantics, and writing research papers (as evidenced by the use of "e.g.,").<br/><br/>My interest in FoC is primarily because of my work on novel programming environments, legal DSLs, and rule-based, high-level, declarative languages. I found FoC through the Podcast on Laurence Diver's Rule(s) of Code paper which struck a chord with me (both the paper and the podcast) because of the forward, out-of-the-box thinking that characterises FoC. In the past few years my students and I spent effort on the <a href="https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/files/papers/eflint.pdf">eFLINT DSL</a>, a language for formalising interpretations of laws and applying them in different contexts (case-based reasoning, access control, verification). Another research line is on "<a href="https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/files/papers/sle22-exp.pdf">exploratory programming</a>" in which programmers (but we target domain-experts such as data scientists, not necessarily software engineers) can experiment with alternative execution paths and compare outputs and effects. Most of my work is published at SPLASH and I will be attending again this year; so perhaps we will run into each other there.<br/><br/>The primary reasons for me to join are to get further inspired by the interesting discussions and demonstrations that are shared here and to find potential collaborators from industry or academia in joint (interdisciplinary) projects. I mention interdisciplinary here because, as a back-end kinda guy engrossed in abstractions, I certainly need help from people that can provide creative insights related to visual design and interfaces!<br/><br/>Looking forward to meeting you all!

Very nice to see you here, Thomas. I'm slightly familiar with eFlint through some of the rules as code work I have done. My personal RaC project, Blawx, is my reason for joining FoC, too!

Hi Jason. Well met again, indeed. Any chance you will be joining ProLaLa this year (which is now part of SPLASH)?

I would love to attend, I didn't realize they were affiliated. Is remote possible?

Definitely for the main events, perhaps ProLaLa as well

Actually, I just learned I will be otherwise occupied in New York that week. But I will look at the materials after!
