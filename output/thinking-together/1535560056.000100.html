Eve always had a focus on having the capability to answer complex queries. At its core was this database of tuples and a series of operators that world work over them -- join, union, aggregate etc. This would allow you to ask things like "Find the average salary per department" very easily.<br/>Mech is pulling back on that and putting everything into a 2D table. This makes freeform databases a little harder, but it makes things really simple and easy to explain, visualize, and understand. I'm hoping that makes the system overall easier to use even if you lose some of the expressibility of Eve.
