&gt; This week in codefaster, I learned something. I wanted to write about fast typing and keyboard layouts. I thought I'd come out that dvorak/colemak are slightly better than qwerty but possibly offset by some costs. Nope, turns out the bottleneck for speed for many people is RSI. So fast typing is all about a keyboard layout which reduces RSI. This, based on my interviewing of a few people and myself, split + tent matter a lot. Negative tilt helps me, but didn't help other people as much. I tried really hard not to bikeshed about pointless detail in the post to keep it short, but I'm worried it still sounds...incomplete as a result. Almost as if the point of detailed research for a reader is not the research itself but to convince the reader I know what I'm talking about? Don't know. In any case, I think the insight of focusing on RSI is pretty good, even if I'm not an expert in fixing RSI.
