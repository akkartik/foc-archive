To be clear — I don't think we should answer these questions directly. They're just things to think about when writing your vision statement. You don't need to address those questions at all, even. I think it'll be more helpful for people who want to learn about your work if you write something that is self-contained, like an elevator pitch (but a bit longer — a page, roughly — so more like an "escalator pitch"). Full sentences and paragraphs. Assume the audience is a member of the community but not aware what your project is about. And placed on your website, so people in the future can refer to it with ease.<br/><br/>I'll try to write up something for my own project as an example tonight, if that helps.

To me, a “pitch” suggests the purpose is to convince this (kinda narrow) audience of the project’s value. I’d prefer an answer to “What’s your perspective and approach?” rather than “Why should I want to use this?” The later is also a pretty hard question for a novel project to convincingly answer without a demo.
