Hi all, I made a page to contextualize 13 billion euros (or 14): an amount owed to Ireland in an EU Apple tax case and all over the airwaves here this week. I use some pretty silly back-of-the-envelope type calculations (the same ones also repeated a lot here this week!).<br/>These calculations aren't especially interesting, but I think I'll use this example to illustrate a close link between numbers: the type that we read and report about everyday, and their formulas/workings - because all numbers have these.<br/>Here you can also change numbers in calculang (e.g. change that 13Bn to 14Bn) and related numbers on the page will flash with updates.<br/><br/>I was glad of this exercise to focus on something a little more relatable to a simple spreadsheet, but portable and structured in terms of calculations imo, unlike a spreadsheet.<br/>And I needed to face a wee small bit about the pains of finding data, and even afterwards: "linking" to it :face_with_thermometer: (i did a lot of c&p hardcode :dotted_line_face:)<br/><br/>The page is: <a href="https://howmuchis13billioneuros.com">HowMuchIs13BillionEuros.com</a>
