Terraform then asks you if you want to proceed and then actually do the job.

The only major difference is that you declare that desired state using an API of a general purpose language. But otherwise, Pulumi does exactly what <@UJ6LDMMN0> said Terraform does — keeping that desired state, creating a plan, previewing it, applying it, etc.\n\nRegarding <@UCUSW7WVD>'s problem, I think the solution in Pulumi would be similar to the one in Terrraform. Define a custom resource that does nothing than just block execution for an amount of time and then to the health check, then use this resource as a dependency of the second host you want to create.\n\nGoing back to the original question of whether it would make sense to have a visual editor for k8s config files, I don't think it would help that much. The problem with YAML is not that it's YAML, it's that it offers no means composition and abstraction. With only a visual editor that all it does is to offer affordances for YAML concepts, things will be the same. But, if that visual editors starts adding some PL concepts, such as variables and functions, then it can be useful, but at this point I think it's no longer about YAML or k8s, it's just about structural editors in general.",

Define a custom resource that does nothing than just block execution for an amount of time and then to the health check, then use this resource as a dependency of the second host you want to create.\n\nGoing back to the original question of whether it would make sense to have a visual editor for k8s config files, I don't think it would help that much. The problem with YAML is not that it's YAML, it's that it offers no means composition and abstraction. With only a visual editor that all it does is to offer affordances for YAML concepts, things will be the same. But, if that visual editors starts adding some PL concepts, such as variables and functions, then it can be useful, but at this point I think it's no longer about YAML or k8s, it's just about structural editors in general."
