If the qualities are visible \/ tangible things you can see and touch (eg: \"I selected this object *because* it is red\") then that lends itself quite naturally to PbD, because you don't need much additional representation beyond what's already on the canvas. But if you want to work with qualities that _aren't_ visible \/ tangible (eg: \"I selected this object *because* it has unsaved changes\"), well you have two choices: 1. find a way to make those qualities visible\/tangible on the canvas, 2. find a way to expose that stuff via some UI and be okay with the fact that it's a little more abstract.",
