For some technologies, there is a perfect time to launch them, when components/networking is cheap enough. I saw somewhere a post that claimed that YouTube was successful because of the timing â€” when it was launched, networking speeds of home users were starting to be good-enough for video transfer, and server costs had gone down. Earlier video sharing sites came too early.<br/><br/>So perhaps Lisa and Star were just a bit too early to be cheap enough for the potential buyers? And Macintosh 128K was barely usable with the limited memory and barely affordable.
