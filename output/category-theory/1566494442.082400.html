Like Tony said, it's probably just holiday season, and as I have some travel coming up myself, but also because my priorities have changed, <b>I'm going to step down as the organizer for the weekly calls</b>.<br/><br/>Thanks to everyone who attended the calls and helped demystify some of the abstract concepts with great examples or just great questions!<br/><br/>Of course, if anybody else wants to pick it up from here that would be awesome. And if not then I'm looking forward to further insightful conversations about category theory on this channel.
