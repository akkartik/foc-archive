Thinking about building some visual programming tools after taking a break for a while. One fun idea that popped up: hybrid text + node-wire environment where you can <em>wire to the text</em>. Like, a word in the text can act as a node. Probably been done somewhere, but I haven't seen it, so I'm kinda jamming on the thought. Like, what if Natto but you exploded the frames, brought some of Bret's Tangle in there, little bit of that style of annotating an image+paragraph by coloring a word the same as a corresponding thing in the image. Constants in the text live-update, etc etc.
