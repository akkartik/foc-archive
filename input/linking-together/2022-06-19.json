Of course, these are just agreed upon terms, so I'll try to explain just my personal view.\n\n\"Literacy\" denotes, for me, the ability to use written language (of any kind, even graphical) to store ideas and to aid in communicating them.\n\n\"[Adjective] literacy\" denotes the ability to appreciate and make use of ideas that make up knowledge generated by the field of [adjective]. It doesn't prescribe any medium through which the ideas should be communicated.\n\n\"Tools for thought\" I view as any \"stuff\" that strengthens someone's ability to _think_. Thinking is a process, so I don't recognize eg. Obsidian as a tool for thought (it's a knowledge base; it doesn't transform your way of thinking). I'm aware that this is very different from the self-description of the TfT community.\n\nMathematical objects (some of them) do qualify as tools for thought because they *actively* enable new ways of thinking \/ they transform your thinking. Mathematics itself is concerned solely with the study of mental objects, mental tools, and mental processes.\n\nI'd say that mathematics and literature (and their corresponding literacies) are complementary, being examples of \"thought-toolmaking\" and \"knowledge-toolmaking\", respectively.
