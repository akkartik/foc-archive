Hi, I've only recently discovered this community but feel like you guys could enjoy a tool I've been working on for the past year and a half which I'm publicly releasing today.<br/><br/>It's called Schéma, it's a visual programming tool combining Block and Node based approaches with focus on direct manipulation, instant feedback of each step in the processing, smooth ux and versatility, even though the first focus of it was light control (DMX, LEDs).<br/><br/>It's developed from the ground up in the VL visual programming language. <br/><br/>I'd love if you tried it out and tell me what you're enjoying, what not and what you can imagine doing with such a tool :relaxed:<br/><br/><a href="https://youtu.be/YSm8iA8DoIc">https://youtu.be/YSm8iA8DoIc</a><br/><br/>More information, including comprehensive documentation, available at <a href="https://schema.scenic.tools/">https://schema.scenic.tools/</a>

Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Daniel Garcia</span>! Currently I'm heading in the licensing direction of vvvv, the environment I made it in. Which is a fairly benevolent free for personal, educational and trial usage and commercial use (which in this case could be for instance a club or higher budgeted event using it as their main light controlling tool) requires a license, likely monthly but I'm still working that out.<br/><br/>At the same time I would love for the whole thing or at least parts of it to be open source, so people can learn from it and modify as they see fit. So I'm at a bit of a crossroads (for a while), thinking how to have it as open as possible while being able to sustain the development without having to rely on projects using it coming my way. I hope for the Patreon to become a substantial part of that equation but it's still very early days.

Nice! What about the terminology used in Schema, like Fixture, Director, Controller, were you inspired by other tools or is it mostly something you came up with?

Fixture comes from lighting, given the versatility I was considering changing this to Agent or Actor however. This might still happen. <br/><br/>Actor would also play well with the film terminology of Director, which is called like that due to its function of commanding others. Now that I return to this topic in my mind I remember that I was also toying with Screenplay for some function in the early days, not sure if for Director or something higher level.<br/><br/>However the plan is to have every Actor being able to tell others what to do as well. Either globally like the Director, spatially based (eg. Actors up to 2 meters) or through other queries. This would again be done by assigning behaviors or sending messages which would then be handled by the behavior of the target Actor.<br/><br/>I had something like this running in one installation I did with XYZ project and it was quite powerful. In a way it would introduce this state machine on steroids into Schéma.<br/><br/>After this change the main difference between Actors and Director will probably be just that one is placed in the scene (on stage) and the other is not. But then why not have them come in and out and have the hierarchy completely flat, with extra capabilities added via some sort of modifier system. <br/><br/>I also had the concept of multiple directors to split responsibilities, which would come back with this.<br/><br/>Controller, that I guess comes from MIDI controllers so that one was pretty natural.

Blocks come from the shape of them but also it's a fairly standard term for this kind of programming. Block Stack less so, even might be contraintuitive to programmers, but I feel like that's what it looks like and Patch or Program is too techy and not like what it looks like :sweat_smile:

Drivers I think mainly come from my experience with Blender. The way you interact with them probably partially from Resolume.

Also at the outset I had a brief stint with bee nomenclature. The program was originally supposed to be called BeeHive/Hive/bHive and the individual atomic behaviors Bees, as little individual workers pulling a common rope in a way. This actually still remains in parts of the code, eg the IBee interface which is used for behaviors. Given that these names were taken, my uncertainty about the idea and me having a little epiphany after drawing some device schematic I went with Schéma in the end. I know it isn't super unique in the world of computers, given XML Schema or the Scheme programming language, but I felt like it really fits the idea and that hopefully the long é (which is how you write the word in my native Czech) and later putting it under the scenic.tools umbrella would differentiate it enough.<br/><br/>Although the é is usually omitted in most communications as people lack é on their keyboards :grinning:

This looks awesome. I haven’t had any experience with vvvv. Is this built from the ground up, or do you get some of the functionality from vvvv? I’m really impressed by the interface. Is there a gui toolkit involved, or is it just a canvas?

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jared Windover</span>, thanks a lot.<br/><br/>Actually vvvv gamma/VL (there's also beta) comes with a lot of libraries dealing with IO, meaning that using ArtNet, OSC or MIDI protocols for instance is a breeze. How you process and generate the data to send over - your application logic - is up to you though.<br/><br/>Second, you can really easily tap into the .NET ecosystem (<a href="http://nuget.org">nuget.org</a>) for additional libraries if the need arises, I'm using SharpDX.XInput for gamepad support for instance.<br/><br/>If you don't know about vvvv gamma, then I suggest you check it out, even just to see how a visual language can be designed so its powers are fundamentally on par with its textual counterparts. <a href="https://visualprogramming.net/">https://visualprogramming.net/</a><br/><br/>The interface is using VL.Skia, vvvv's wrapper around SkiaSharp. It provides basic primitives, paths and text, grouping of draw calls into layers, transformations and a rudimentary notification system for handling user input so it is a kind of a slightly smarter canvas.<br/><br/>When I started out, there was no GUI toolkit for VL so all the widgets are patched from primitives and those are then combined together in various ways. This I think allowed me to strike a very unique look and feel though, it's really closer to a game than a traditional IDE.<br/><br/>Nowadays there is Elementa, which is quite cool and has really extensive features with styling and all sorts of layouting. I'm considering porting all my widgets to its architecture eventually. It might benefit Schéma and maybe save me some time in the long run. But the widgets I made are so purpose-built to deal with the needs of my program so there is quite a gap in model handling, styling, etc. So I'm not sure if it would be the right step.

I wondered the whole video what this was for. In the last ten seconds there is a a hint that its purpose is to edit some kind of 3D scene or visuals.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@David Piepgrass</span> Yes, I agree that it's not very clear from the video. It is mainly a tutorial to get you started with the environment.<br/><br/>I do understand the need for a short trailer-format presentation of the capabilities.<br/><br/>The 3D scene you create is only a stepping stone.<br/><br/>So far, I have mainly used it for light programming and setting up audio reactive, interactive and kinetic objects, in essence dealing with real-life objects.<br/><br/>Think stage lighting, LEDs, eg:<br/><a href="https://youtu.be/9Njcf-cxLxg">https://youtu.be/9Njcf-cxLxg</a><br/><br/>Physically interactable objects, eg:<br/><a href="https://youtu.be/gG3_ubrUpfg">https://youtu.be/gG3_ubrUpfg</a><br/><br/>Lately I've been also exploring using it as a VJ tool:<br/><a href="https://youtu.be/EbdbSbtwrvA">https://youtu.be/EbdbSbtwrvA</a><br/><br/>I highly suggest you check out <a href="https://schema.scenic.tools/gallery/">https://schema.scenic.tools/gallery/</a> for more examples.<br/><br/>The thing is, though, in essence Schéma is a general multi-purpose toolkit much in the vein of vvvv or TouchDesigner.<br/><br/>But it's more opinionated in how it treats various IO, scene recall, objects, data structures, DMX channel mapping, MIDI inputs, etc.<br/><br/>This reduces some of the flexibility but lets you not reinvent the wheel and lends the whole environment a consistent feel. with the internals knowing how to talk to one another.<br/><br/>This way, even entirely new functionality, such as multiuser sessions, can be brought in in the form of a plugin.<br/><br/>And using standard supported communication protocols such as OSC you're able to integrate Schéma with other tools.<br/><br/>Think for instance using MaxMSP to generate audio and then sending OSC triggers to activate light sequences authored in Schéma.<br/><br/><b>TL;DR</b><br/>Use it to drive lights, generate visuals, create interactive media installations, integrate with other tools and think of new creative uses while you quickly iterate in the live environment.
