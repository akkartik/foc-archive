Hey Folks!<br/><br/>I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacolonwalker/">Jacolon Walker</a>. Been in the cyber security / infosec space for 15+ years.  From netsec analyst, security engineer, exploit developer, reverse engineer, director and CISO. Interested in all things challenging :smile: . I found this slack through an alumni network from an previous employer. As for interesting hobbies, gardening, cycling, playing, guitar and smoking some nice cigars and becoming a pro at evacuation preparedness giving the state of the fires that are happening here on the west coast. Happy to be joining in the community here
