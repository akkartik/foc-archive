You can't escape wiring as a thing that needs doing.  After trying a bunch of approaches here and there, the ultimate best I can imagine is something in the spirit of type-directed explicit disambiguation.  So when you first write code, you tell the system, "here's an X, here's a Y, let's combine them."  It shows the ways to do so.  Then you pick a specific one.  (See also inheritance.)  Dynamic lookup rules will at times be right and at times be wrong and usually be confusing.  Consider the following.  This was Java (don't know if they've changed it since), which dispatches based on the type of the variables used, not on their values:<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap"><br/>class StaticOverloadingMightSurpriseYou {<br/>    void overloaded(Object o) { System.out.println("as understood as an object"); }<br/>    void overloaded(String s) { System.out.println("as understood as a string"); }<br/>    public static void main(String[] args) {<br/>        String hello = "hello, world";<br/>        Object world = hello;<br/>        overloaded(hello); // prints "as understood as an object"<br/>        overloaded(world); // prints "as understood as a string"<br/>    }<br/>}<br/></pre><br/><br/>Of course if <tt>overloaded</tt> is a method in two classes, the dispatch would be based on the value.  So, as a rule, <tt>x.m(y)</tt> may work differently than a superficially equivalent <tt>m_(x, y)</tt> or <tt>y.m__(x)</tt>.
