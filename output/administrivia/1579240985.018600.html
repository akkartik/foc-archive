The Recurse Center has a “Blaggregator” — a tool where you can register your blog’s RSS feed and then every new post will automatically be announced in a #blogging Zulip channel.<br/><a href="https://blaggregator.recurse.com/about/">https://blaggregator.recurse.com/about/</a><br/><br/>1. I think that would be great for us too so we can track and discuss blog posts of members here. I don’t know how to make that work but surely there must be some Slack app that can do this.<br/>2. That could be also interesting for automatically posting tweets here although I would like that to be a different channel to distinguish blog posts from tweets.

I found these:<br/>• <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/205346227">https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/205346227</a><br/>• <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/218688467-Add-RSS-feeds-to-Slack">https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/218688467-Add-RSS-feeds-to-Slack</a><br/>Seems straightforward. What I don't know is how to handle the process of adding Twitter accounts and RSS feeds — would be suboptimal if an admin here had to do that each time.

Cool — I like the "blaggregator" idea quite a bit. After that survey is done and people have had a chance to respond, and after we've made whatever changes we're going to make to the community platform, I'm planning to spend some time adding additional tools like these ones you've found, and improving the documentation and first-run experience for people coming to the community. I think with a bit of work, we can make this community more engaging, more like a hub connecting all our efforts and projects, without making it too noisy for people who just want to casually follow along.<br/><br/>Thanks for the suggestions and taking the time to look up these tools!
