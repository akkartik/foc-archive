I haven't been doing much coding lately (past ~4 months), so I'm doing a tiny side project to test out some new ways of working.<br/>1. I'm converting an old CLJS project to TypeScript. I really wanted to authentically <em>live in</em> CLJS, but after months and months of trying, I never got over pain caused by the tooling. (This was back in ~2016, and I hear things have come a long way since. I'd give it another shot, but I no longer have much free time to learn languages/ecosystems.) I tried to get GPT to actually just convert the whole CLJS codebase. It was a mixed success. This is why I chose TypeScript, rather than (my preference) some dynamically-typed language. As it passes through an intentional state of <em>chaotic mush</em>, I want as much <em>structure</em> as possible to be imposed upon my work. Once the conversion is done and I'm ready to resume work on the actual capabilities of the system, I'll probably gradually convert it to JS so that I can get away from needing a build step at all.<br/>2. Inspired by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Maggie Appleton</span>, I'm using native apps for Whisper and GPT. When I want to know how to do something, I just ramble out loud. Eg: "Does JavaScript have any syntax yet for iterating over the keys and values of an object without using object.entries?" I've found that for certain kinds of question, it feels really fluid. It might not be any faster than switching to my browser, typing <tt><a href="http://mdn.io">mdn.io</a></tt> followed by my query, and then scanning the page. But it often is, and even when it isn't it just feels really nice to get some help from the computer without having to touch the keyboard. (I have a weird relationship with my sense of touch — for instance, I really dislike touching anything made of metal and think we need to put all the metal back in the ground where it belongs, we've awoken a demon of unhindered conduction and are reaping the consequences, we're all damn fools — so it's nice to be able to converse directly with my computer without having to touch anything)

Are they native macOS apps? I have been looking for one to add to my stable of ⌘␣ (Spotlight, find files) and ⌘⇧A (Soulver, do math).
