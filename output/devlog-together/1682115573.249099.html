Saw a few people share snippets of Subset on Twitter so we decided to make it a lil easier by adding a screenshot feature!<br/><br/>The cool/fun tidbit is that when we needed to change the background color of the canvas before we took a screenshot, but thought it looked ugly. So we came up with this camera shutter effect, which masks the actual background changing itâ€™s color to blue, screenshotting, and turning back to grey.
