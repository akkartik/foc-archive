<b>Welcome to #share-your-work!</b><br/><br/>This is the channel for discussion about all our own FoC projects. If you want feedback, collaborators, high-fives, or just a place to drop your latest output, this is the place.<br/><br/>This channel is especially sensitive to tone, so please keep things positive and constructive. Critique is great, criticism is not.<br/><br/>• If your work is more about programming as practiced today than programming of a hypothetical <em>much better</em> future, please share it in #present-company. This is a fuzzy boundary that we'll more clearly establish over the coming months, so if in doubt, by all means post here.<br/>• Blog posts about your own FoC work are welcome here. If you'd just like to direct people to your blog post about the FoC more generally, not about your specific FoC project work, that probably belongs in #linking-together.
