I made a 'narrative visualization' blog post that's about pension savings. Like other places I use calculang it combines reactive programming/visualization (OJS and Vega) and calculang models (a pension calculator, which is using a separate income tax model for a tax relief calc- an example of model composition)<br/><br/>FP nature of calculang and no state and FRP nature of the rest makes it kinda easy to put together - Some viz signals and some calculang parameters condition on <tt>progress</tt> which increments as the user scrolls (the reactive systems do the rest).<br/><br/>I'd like to bring a few tools together to streamline DX for this kind of output for calculang models - it could be even more declarative. (+see <a href="https://github.com/idyll-lang/fidyll">Fidyll</a>)<br/>Happy to hear any feedback or suggestions.<br/><br/><a href="https://calcwithdec.dev/posts/pictures-pensions/">https://calcwithdec.dev/posts/pictures-pensions/</a>
