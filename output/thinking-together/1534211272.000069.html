Great question from <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> that I'm interested in as well. There's good advice from <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> . I'm mostly stuck around framing/phrasing the problem I'm hoping to solve. I've found some things that <b>seem like</b> progress, at least. One is ways to filter and keep track of papers etc. using skimming and highlighting of key phrases in some annotation system (I use <a href="http://hypothes.is">hypothes.is</a>). The key phrases are ones that are either insights or things I clearly disagree with - so skimming the highlights kind of tells me when and if I want to read more. The other thing is just writing - I keep a semi-organized notes (some sections and sub-sections) with ideas etc that just pop into my head at any time or when reading any material. Every so often I try to do a review and reorg of the notes and sometime I also do a proper write-up of some topic, pulling from my notes. This helps me feel that something is 'processed' and not have to spin that stuff in my head again. I don't really have research 'days' because I only find scattered time here and there.
