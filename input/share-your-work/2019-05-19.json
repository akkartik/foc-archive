On a first look, it's hard to see whether such a representation is more readable than current code, but that's most likely my own bias.\nI'd really like more \"graphical\" code representations. Non-monospace fonts, more flexible whitespace, \"rendered\" documentation (like md cells in Jupyer notebooks), intelligent line wrapping or even real 2D layouts would be possible. \nMany people (me included) have previously tried to make Structure Editors to achieve more graphical representations, but it's really hard to even get OK-isch usability. \nI really like your idea of using text for modifications and a rendered view for reading code.",

On a first look, it's hard to see whether such a representation is more readable than current code, but that's most likely my own bias.\nI'd really like more \"graphical\" code representations. Non-monospace fonts, more flexible whitespace, \"rendered\" documentation (like md cells in Jupyer notebooks), intelligent line wrapping or even real 2D layouts would be possible. \nMany people (me included) have previously tried to make Structure Editors to achieve more graphical representations, but it's really hard to even get OK-isch usability. \nI really like your idea of using text for modifications and a rendered view for reading code."
