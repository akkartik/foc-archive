Hi everyone! Lately I tend to introduce myself as a barbarian programmer. I mean that in a few different ways:<br/><br/>• I tend to be a curmudgeon, happier by myself than "organizing" into groups to achieve some shared goal. This doesn't mean I dislike collaboration. I just think we tend to conflate collaboration with <em>synchronous</em> collaboration, and asynchronous collaboration is a better fit for many tasks. Asynchronous collaboration can span great distances in space and time. You reading Aristotle could be asynchronous collaboration -- if you are then able to build on what you read in some way and put out some artifact that someone else can collaborate with. UX people like to say "don't make me think". I like to say "don't make me talk to you". Show me what you built in a form that I can read, listen to, play interactively with and gradually understand/appreciate. I may still come talk to you if the situation merits it (I actually love talking to people, believe it or not), but give me the choice.<br/>• I think we've been doing city-living cheek-by-jowl for so long that we've forgotten what benefits it has, and continue cargo-culting it long after it's become superfluous. I don't mean that literally; I love living in cities. But our software stacks have many of the same patterns as cities, and they aren't really necessary: a) promiscuously adding dependencies, b) relying implicitly on some sort of division of labor, so that if we find a problem in a dependency we don't feel empowered to fix it for ourselves, instead turning to ways to try to get others to do it for us like paying, bullying, cajoling, passing laws, etc. It's worth swinging that pendulum back a bit, to imagine we're out on the steppe with just what we have on our backs and nobody else around for miles, and try to achieve our ends with 10x fewer libraries and frameworks. (More details: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16882140#16882555">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16882140#16882555</a> .)<br/>• It emphasizes sustainability. When you live off the land (I gather; I wouldn't actually know) you are more attuned to how you affect your environment. Your <em>externalities</em>. We city dwellers just expect someone else to cart our trash out for us.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this is all aspirational, because the way we write software doesn't really work for a barbarian. I've been working very slowly on extricating a kernel of software and way of writing software that can be more self-sufficient and sustainable. I started out building a new programming language based on Lisp (<a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart">http://akkartik.name/post/wart</a>, which itself grew out of a startup; those who can't startup shave yaks), then grew frustrated with the stack below me and simultaneously realized languages don't matter, and build a toy VM and OS (<a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu#readme">https://github.com/akkartik/mu#readme</a> ; <a href="http://akkartik.name/about">http://akkartik.name/about</a>), used it to teach programming for a couple of years, then grew frustrated with how slow it was and gradually faced up to the need to understand even more low-level details. Lately I've been building simple tools for programming in machine code (<a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu/tree/master/subx#readme">https://github.com/akkartik/mu/tree/master/subx#readme</a>), but in the past week I've set this aside to design a type-safe language that I can bootstrap out of machine code (no link yet).

This is my umpteenth attempt at trying to set out my dissatisfactions and motivations, so if it made no sense but you're somehow still reading, maybe one of my earlier attempts will help triangulate (in reverse chronological order):<br/><br/><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/mdmcdi/little_languages_by_jon_bentley_1986#c_3miuf2">https://lobste.rs/s/mdmcdi/little_languages_by_jon_bentley_1986#c_3miuf2</a><br/><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/8i33hq/mu_revisited">https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/8i33hq/mu_revisited</a><br/><a href="https://plforums.org/practice/minimal-features-required-for-an-extensible-language#post_65">https://plforums.org/practice/minimal-features-required-for-&hellip;</a><br/><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/n0d3qo#c_rue8pf">https://lobste.rs/s/n0d3qo#c_rue8pf</a><br/><a href="http://akkartik.name/about">http://akkartik.name/about</a><br/><br/>I get the sense a lot of you are concerned with more high-level concerns like high level languages, live programming, Bret Victor, visual programming and so on. Think of me as trying to build better foundations for your castles. Because the crap you're building on today, it ain't gonna last. (It won't just disintegrate one day, instead it'll gradually put out shoots and suffocate all your degrees of freedom until you're totally ossified.)

(I highly recommend <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/03/10/the-return-of-the-barbarian">https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/03/10/the-return-of-the-barbarian</a>, which radically shifted my sense of what a barbarian is, and how they've historically interacted with sedentary peoples. Also worth reading is <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/lemmings">http://akkartik.name/post/lemmings</a> . The book it's from is one of ten hardcopy books I own, and I wrote the Wikipedia page for it: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fates_of_Nations">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fates_of_Nations</a> (History is an enduring interest. "History seems to me so important that it's misleading to treat it as a mere field of study. Another way to describe it is <em>all the data we have so far</em>." -- <a href="http://paulgraham.com/essay.html">http://paulgraham.com/essay.html</a> ))<br/><br/>(I also like parentheses.

&gt;Because the crap you're building on today, it ain't gonna last. (It won't just disintegrate one day, instead it'll gradually put out shoots and suffocate all your degrees of freedom until you're totally ossified.)<br/><br/>That’s a pretty bold statement, given that we’re all running on systems that have lots of components that consist of C code from the seventies… ;-)<br/><br/>That said, I see what you’re after. We all believe it could be much better than it is. But I wouldn’t hope for the old stuff to just break. If that was a factor, it would’ve happened by now.<br/><br/>Now I also wonder how many of us read ribbonfarm? Is there a correlation in the form of “people who like ribbonfarm also like to fix computing”?

:joy: Disclosure: I've also written for ribbonfarm.<br/><br/>Tangent: Do y'all feel post-rationalist? I sure don't, and yet that's how ribbonfarm gets grouped in <a href="https://medium.com/intellectual-explorers-club/memetic-tribes-and-culture-war-2-0-14705c43f6bb">https://medium.com/intellectual-explorers-club/memetic-tribe&hellip;</a><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>There's a reason I didn't say "break", and added the caveat about what "not lasting" means.<br/><br/>As a concrete example, simple tasks like copying strings, syncing to the file system and waiting on multiple file descriptors are fundamentally broken/insecure/errorprone on C. This stuff is an ongoing cost we all pay to this day, regardless of whether we program in C.<br/><br/>Exhibit B: the accretion of ruby/gem/rvm/bundler and python/distutils/pip/virtualenv. It happens because we feel disempowered to change the foundations. And yet each level up provides only temporary relief, and creates its own issues that need escaping. Escape lies downward.

"promiscuously adding dependencies"<br/><br/>Amen to that.... I instinctually resist adding dependencies to my programs. But why is that? Maybe a need to understand my system very well? Maybe the idea that it'll eventually have to be a web browser SPA and I don't want to rudely gobble up all the user's bandwidth? Maybe because my previous apps used to have to run on a 400MHz machine?<br/><br/>"you are more attuned to how you affect your environment. Your <em>externalities</em>"<br/>Preach it brother! I think that's why I write a lot of documentation for my software, and where necessary, am concerned with backward and sometimes even forward compatibility... it's not <em>just</em> that I want my software to be understood and liked, but that I don't want to waste other people's time either.
