Reading the philosophical discussion it occurred to me that thanks to the abstract / general nature of category theory, there are as many different reasons why people are interested in it. I'm interested in it for actually quite practical reasons. Thought I'll list a few here, to provide a counter-balance to the more philosophically themed discussion (which is also valid, just not my cup of tea):<br/><br/>• There's the connection between <b>type systems</b> and categories. As I mentioned in the call, category theory felt like finding the missing pages of the Haskell manual to me. Suddenly a lot more of the type stuff in Haskell made so much more sense to me, e.g. types as set of (possible) values, abstract data types and their composition, higher-kinded types, etc. For me a lot of things I thought I understand suddenly "clicked"; I had a lot of valuable "Aha!" moments that I'm sure make me a better functional programmer.<br/>• As <span style="background-color:#ccf">@William Taysom</span> pointed out during the call, there's a super-tight connection between (relational) <b>databases</b> and categories. The <em>Seven Sketches</em> book introduces categories using this connection in chapter 3. They allude to (and there is further research from one of the authors) that category theory provides a formal way of transforming one relational database schema into another, which I find very useful for building more flexible universal data models, which is one of the things I'm exploring currently.<br/>• <b>Graphs</b> can also trivially be converted into (free) categories, which means there is a visual representation that comes with denotational semantics out-of-the-box. Which somehow seems interesting to me, if you're also into visual programming languages… that's also what the <em>Graphical Linear Algebra</em> blog is rooted in.<br/><br/>Overall there appears to be a lot of power in Functors — the "magic" behind your friendly <tt>map()</tt> function in your favorite programming language, except that that's just one incarnation of the concept, and it seems to work in lots of other contexts too. I want to understand this well enough to be able to apply this to other domains.<br/><br/>Take all this with a grain of salt, as I'm still learning and might not really understand what I'm talking about…
