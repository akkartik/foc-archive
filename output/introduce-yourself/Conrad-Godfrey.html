Hello!<br/><br/>I'm Conrad from London. I started writing code in Macromedia Flash 8 in like 2006 because I wanted to make cool shapes, and make my animations do things that weren't possible by hand.<br/>I wound up studying computer sciecne and working in various startups in London - at the moment I'm doing a bit of Freelance Software Engineering and Teaching code too! I'd really like to do more teaching.<br/><br/>I'm only just discovering the Future of Code ecosystem - spiritually it reminds me of why I started coding. So I'm grateful it exists! Heard of it through a friend called Greg who pointed me in the direction of Todepond.<br/><br/>Currently trying to do more Digital Gardening, whatever takes my fancy at any given time, putting out lots of half finished stuff. What the kids are calling scrappy fiddles perhaps.<br/><br/>Interested in Maps, Music (broadly, but also the particularly niche of barbershop quartet singing), Visualisations, Multi-modal interfaces.<br/><br/><a href="http://conradgodfrey.com">conradgodfrey.com</a>
