I just discovered this Slack while trawling r/programminglanguages! I'm hoping to meet some people with similar interests to mine. I'm an idealistic software developer who keeps getting distracted from actual projects by thinking about how cool computing <em>could</em> be if our tools were better. I usually view language design as part of a continuum with API design, OS design, and databases. Currently in the DC area. Looking forward to talking with you all!
