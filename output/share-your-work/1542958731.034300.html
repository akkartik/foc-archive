Hey everyone! Recently I realized that human is an ultimate interface for programming language design.<br/>I'm working on a draft of the article that describes an interesting idea:<br/><a href="http://vladimir-vg.me/p/0c9d65f4-7cd3-40cb-83f1-a964f7076ccf/">http://vladimir-vg.me/p/0c9d65f4-7cd3-40cb-83f1-a964f7076ccf/</a><br/><br/>I would love to hear your feedback, any ideas that come to your mind after reading this.

Personally, for my own goal of programming for non-techies, I don't think pure typed FP is the answer, it's indeed too firmly down the Order end of <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Vladimir Gordeev</span>â€™s scale. The real world has state, visible everywhere, and real "types" are in the eye of the beholder.

Yeah. I'm trying to find a way to understand when it becomes too rigid, when it becomes to chaotic.<br/>There must be a way to test it. An experiment to conduct that shows how far current design is from proper balance.

A response to the article: I don't think it is accurate to link the drawbacks of Haskell's IO model (i.e. monads) to its type system. There are other ways of introducing IO to statically typed pure functional languages, including (as I've mentioned before) the actor model, which Elm implements, and which people seem to find easier.

Fair point, Thanks. So this rigidness is not because of type system, because of something else.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span> - your argument is compelling. Let me add some nuance so you can see where I'm coming from as well:<br/><br/>&gt; Personally, for my own goal of programming for non-techies,<br/><br/>I have a similar goal, but while I used to be concerned with someone's <b>first few experiences</b> of programming, I am now not so worried if they need to spend a reasonable amount of time (similar the amount of time people spend to learn Excel) to get up to speed. I am now more concerned with the problem of <b>normal people wanting to make small changes to large app that the use in a reasonable amount of time</b> (which will take longer if they are not yet used to programming at all or in this new system).<br/><br/>&gt; The real world<br/><br/>The is a common strategy, trying to argue that a language feature or paradigm is "closer to reality" somehow. For example, Alan Kay talks about how objects are great because they are like biological cells and cells are able to create great complexity, emerging from simple parts. That convinced me in the past, but I am now skeptical of those claims, because "like reality" is not an end in and of itself. The goal, I believe, is the <b>comprehensibility of large systems</b> and nature seems to resist comprehension, or at least be quite difficult to comprehend, a la quantum mechanics.<br/><br/>&gt; has state,<br/><br/>There are a few different ways to handle state in FP. My preferred way is the original FRP, now called DCTP (denotative continuous time programming). I think it's truly beautiful,  but it also took me months to fully grasp, so it's hard to communicate why.<br/><br/>Here's one way to understand it: it's like directly plopping the equations from your physics textbook into your text editor and then you have gravity. It's like math. No IO Monad required.<br/><br/>&gt;  visible everywhere,<br/><br/>Firstly, state in the "real world" is not visible everywhere... unless you're some sort of superhero with x-ray vision... if so, that's a different discussion... :wink:<br/><br/>Secondly, <b>composibiliy</b> is a really important property, and it's hindered by global state.<br/><br/>&gt; and real "types" are in the eye of the beholder.<br/><br/>This is a fascinating claim. Types are a really difficult thing to pin down and define. In my head, they've always had to do with the <b>shape</b> of some data. I have an essay on it, here. <a href="https://medium.com/@stevekrouse/types-are-shapes-d6af1e83192f">https://medium.com/@stevekrouse/types-are-shapes-d6af1e83192f</a><br/><br/>If we use this metaphor to think through what you said, I think you would be incorrect because shapes are objective in reality. You simply cannot fit a round peg into a square hole.<br/><br/>I guess you could say that "round" and "square" are human-defined concepts... but if you want different concepts I guess you could make your own types and type classes

Imperative languages typically provide an imperative model of IO, also known as "anything goes", which makes anything possible, but good program architecture hard.

I currently am working on making a Haskell-like language feel very fluid.<br/><br/>Here's the vision: instead of telling you when you're <b>wrong</b>, types should be aids that help you "figure out what's possible*. To get a physical sense of what I mean, imagine a toy kit with toys of different shapes and being able to feel with your hands which toys can go where based on their shapes and how they slide into one and other - or get jammed.<br/><br/>&gt; to the <b>model</b> of IO that Haskell makes available.<br/><br/>The IO monad is not truly Haskell, where I'm defining <b>true Haskell</b> to be a "denotative" language. Original FRP (DCTP) is. Or at least it's much closer. This is a really subtle and beautiful point that I'm obsessed with. <a href="http://conal.net/blog/posts/can-functional-programming-be-liberated-from-the-von-neumann-paradigm">http://conal.net/blog/posts/can-functional-programming-be-li&hellip;</a>

I'm really early on what the interface would look like. Probably not text, but something more structured.<br/><br/>&gt; There would be a way to learn what kind of IO is possible?<br/><br/>This is the wrong question. The right question is: given better abstractions than IO with complicated types, how can I wrangle these types to do what I want?

I agree the IO monad is rubbish. As I mentioned, I think Elm does it better (by working on messages instead of recreating imperative instruction sequences). I've tried and failed before to gain any insight from Conal. I think the fact that few people truly understand (and can apply) what he's talking about suggests that it may just be obtuse gospel built around fragments of insight (as harsh as that judgement may be).

&gt;  I think the fact that few people truly understand (and can apply) what he's talking about suggests that it may just be obtuse gospel built around fragments of insight (as harsh as that judgement may be).<br/><br/>I know! I 100% used to think that but then annoying people kept pushing me to go back to it and eventually I saw that light and <b>became</b> one of those annoying people. It's a disease. Stay away!

&gt; the problem of normal people wanting to make small changes to large app that the use in a reasonable amount of time<br/><br/>Sounds good to me. I'm up for that challenge!<br/><br/><br/>&gt; "like reality" is not an end in and of itself.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, "like reality" is absolutely what this is about: "programming is casting spells over reality", even if that reality is generated by machines. It's about the perception of the person doing the programming being met well enough.<br/><br/><br/>&gt; The goal, I believe, is the <b>comprehensibility of large systems</b> and nature seems to resist comprehension<br/><br/>With good structuring, you can comprehend a large system by looking only at a small subsystem. And you only need to comprehend the nature you care about to the degree it's useful.<br/><br/><br/>&gt; There are a few different ways to handle state in FP. My preferred way is the original FRP, now called DCTP (denotative continuous time programming). I think it's truly beautiful,  but it also took me months to fully grasp, so it's hard to communicate why.<br/><br/>I think "in FP" is the problem: you need to give state a first class status, then add FP! I don't like streams or event streams or anything that forces natural models of reality into a theoretical straitjacket. My mother doesn't see a stream of events around her: she sees changing state!<br/><br/><br/>&gt; state in the "real world" is not visible everywhere<br/><br/>My mother would disagree - everywhere she looks and walks is a whole bunch of state that was there yesterday and will probably be there tomorrow, with a few changes perhaps..<br/><br/><br/>&gt; It's like math. No IO Monad required.<br/><br/>I agree that "No IO Monad required" is an excellent goal! As is being well-ordered like mathematical abstractions.<br/><br/><br/>&gt; <b>composability</b> is a really important property, and it's hindered by global state.<br/><br/>Not if you structure your global state - the web is composed very well, thanks!<br/><br/><br/><br/>&gt; Types are a really difficult thing to pin down and define. In my head, they've always had to do with the <b>shape</b> of some data. I have an essay on it.. If we use this metaphor to think through what you said, I think you would be incorrect because shapes are objective in reality. You simply cannot fit a round peg into a square hole.  I guess you could say that "round" and "square" are human-defined concepts... but if you want different concepts I guess you could make your own types and type classes<br/><br/>I'm in the duck typing camp: if you can hit a small glass bottle into the round hole using a square peg as a hammer, you're good to go..<br/><br/>I think shape===type, too, in fact: if I see some data shape as this type and you see that shape as that type, who cares?

Responses to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span>... this lack of nesting is getting hard!<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; "like reality" is not an end in and of itself.<br/><br/>&gt; As far as I'm concerned, "like reality" is absolutely what this is about: "programming is casting spells over reality", even if that reality is generated by machines. It's about the perception of the person doing the programming being met well enough.<br/><br/>It's a two-sided problem as described in this Bret Victor photo: <a href="http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/Images/Tool2.png">http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/Images/Tool2.png</a><br/><br/>I'm arguing that the "part that fits the person" doesn't need to be that closely related to the "part that fits the problem". We have some flexibility here.<br/><br/>&gt; I don't like streams or event streams or anything that forces natural models of reality into a theoretical straitjacket. My mother doesn't see a stream of events around her: she sees changing state!<br/><br/>Your mother also doesn't see the equations for the laws of physics but they are the best way to <b>model</b> reality (that we have discovered so far). They are the best tool for the job for understanding and predicting reality. That's the key -- not to simply defer to what people already have in their brains but to build a powerful tool to extend their capabilities, which will require them to grow what's in their brains to meet the "tool" halfway.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; state in the "real world" is not visible everywhere<br/><br/>&gt; My mother would disagree - everywhere she looks and walks is a whole bunch of state that was there yesterday and will probably be there tomorrow, with a few changes perhaps..<br/><br/>There's a ton of state that is hidden to us all. For example, the other night I felt like I was getting sick. I didn't know. It was all hidden inside me. Turns out it was just a blip. I have no idea why. Reality is quite opaque for a lot of questions. Software has the potential to be <b>infinitely</b> understandable and <b>infinitely</b> customizable* - why settle for the meagerness of reality?<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; <b>composability</b> is a really important property, and it's hindered by global state.<br/><br/>&gt; Not if you structure your global state - the web is composed very well, thanks!<br/><br/>This is only because the web as global state is just static pages. The web doesn't have dynamic global state, where one web page can modify another page's state. That's maintained by ugly HTTP plumbing code on the side.

&gt;&gt; As far as I'm concerned, "like reality" is absolutely what this is about: "programming is casting spells over reality", even if that reality is generated by machines. It's about the perception of the person doing the programming being met well enough.<br/><br/>&gt;It's a two-sided problem as described in this Bret Victor photo: <a href="http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/Images/Tool2.png">http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/Images/Tool2.png</a> (26 kB)<br/>&gt;I'm arguing that the "part that fits the person" doesn't need to be that closely related to the "part that fits the problem". We have some flexibility here.<br/><br/>Well if the handle is the "What" of programming (thus declaratively in my preference) and the head is the "How" (the imperative machinery of the computer), then I think everything about the How part can and should be hidden away, on its way to achieving the human visible or interactable What. So I think that much we can agree. Our "spells over reality" are the What; the handle. Our perception of success is What-like, reality-like, in the terms of the reality our spells are intended to influence. All the hidden mechanism - the How - is still "real", sure, but we both agree can be hidden complexity. So maybe we agree?<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; I don't like streams or event streams or anything that forces natural models of reality into a theoretical straitjacket. My mother doesn't see a stream of events around her: she sees changing state!<br/><br/>&gt;Your mother also doesn't see the equations for the laws of physics but they are the best way to <b>model</b> reality (that we have discovered so far). They are the best tool for the job for understanding and predicting reality. That's the key -- not to simply defer to what people already have in their brains but to build a powerful tool to extend their capabilities, which will require them to grow what's in their brains to meet the "tool" halfway.<br/><br/>Obviously kids don't have to learn the laws of physics in order to quickly get started building a fun game in something like Roblox or Minecraft. Which is re-use or library territory: they can implement their own physics laws one day, but for now, just re-use this pre-packaged knowledge. I think we should not ask too much of people - the tools/language/IDE/pre-created libraries should do everything they can to meet the non-technical person who's programming in their own terms, building on what they already know.<br/><br/>And what they already know is that there's the familiar states of things, and those states change in familiar behavioural ways. So allow them to declare states, attach pre-packaged behaviours and extend those behaviours with new ones.

&gt;&gt;&gt; state in the "real world" is not visible everywhere<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; My mother would disagree - everywhere she looks and walks is a whole bunch of state that was there yesterday and will probably be there tomorrow, with a few changes perhaps..<br/><br/>&gt;There's a ton of state that is hidden to us all. For example, the other night I felt like I was getting sick. I didn't know. It was all hidden inside me. Turns out it was just a blip. I have no idea why. Reality is quite opaque for a lot of questions. Software has the potential to be <b>infinitely</b> understandable and <b>infinitely</b> customizable* - why settle for the meagerness of reality?<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but I don't get this point! If there's state that's hidden, then it's not part of our reality over which we want to cast our magic programs. The meagerness of reality is what people want to animate with their magic. Not sure I get where you're going with the <b>infinitely</b> part.. ?<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>composability</b> is a really important property, and it's hindered by global state.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; Not if you structure your global state - the web is composed very well, thanks!<br/><br/>&gt;This is only because the web as global state is just static pages. The web doesn't have dynamic global state, where one web page can modify another page's state. That's maintained by ugly HTTP plumbing code on the side.<br/><br/>Well, funny you should describe that concept, as that's related to how the Object Network works, except that Object Net Objects can't modify each other: they are masters of their own state, and depend on the states around them in the web/net of Objects, no ugly pipework, just declarative rules.

My concern is that these side threads are off the main channels and perhaps less visible to other potential contributors. Especially since all the meat of discussion happens here. My proposal is a new channel dedicated to discussing the future and nature of programming, without side threads.

Now onto the meaty stuff:<br/><br/>In general I agree with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span> about state - it absolutely needs to be a first class citizen. It's not just about being easier to start with, but everything we use the computer for involves state - our 'final goals' are state oriented. E.g. 'send person X a message Y', 'find my picture from yesterday, remove red-eye', 'move $X from my account to my friend' and so on - things have name, state, mutation, history etc. I'm not saying mathematical functions are not useful - but that we have to start with state and then incorporate the functional transforms. E.g. if we have an object with name N, we could consider its transformation somewhat mathematically. The transform definition (~function) itself could be considered another stateful object with history and could live in the same world as the objects it mutates - rather than in an outside world.<br/><br/>I also agree with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> that IO is an implementation. Really this problem only appears if you first slice your system into programs because 'IO' is just messages leaving or entering your program. While if you look at the whole system, the only IO is what leaves the system, everything else is just messaging at the 'boundary of two subsystems' as Roly said? Orthogonal persistence also shares the idea that IO is an implementation.<br/><br/>Re comrehensibility of large systems, I feel what's most useful is inspectability - the ability to ask the system specific questions - ask what is connected to what; what behavior will change when you change something etc. Any model - OO/FP whatever will fail at scale because mental simulation wont scale up way. We already have some querying capability - source control tells us what files changed when, databases tell us what data changed, tracing/logging tells us sequences of some events, build systems can be queried for dependencies etc. But all of these are ad hoc and compose so poorly.

And I/O and state are related in the sense that the types (shapes or match-patterns) of state are only meaningful if there's I/O. Which means the value of the system becomes "transformation between types".

I feel like a broken record at this point but I feel I should mention that everything <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Shalabh</span> just said about systems represented by state undergoing functional transformations, and I/O as messages to/from the outside world, is expressed directly by the <b>actor model</b>. If that's how you want to represent systems, this is probably the model you want.

Yes I do like the actor model. But it is very underspecified. E.g. how exactly do you specify the state and the transformation? What is the machinery inside and actor? Do they share  predefined language of messages? How is that defined? Do you program these one at a time or do you have knobs to affect groups of these actors? Can you specify cross actor constraints? How does naming and versioning work? etc.<br/><br/>One thing I forgot to bring up is this: do we think a single model is sufficient/best to do all programming? Can we have multiple models of the exact same state/process? Can we use any of these to program the system?

Yeah, the actor model is merely a foundation to build upon, not a comprehensive solution.<br/>I'm not sure about the utility of multiple models.

So I read this and first I think - are Haskell and Lisp really opposites? They both seemed similarly overwhelming to me. Lisp because it was different than everything I was used to (being invented in 1958 makes it an alien world, and I have no doubt that you could easily get hopelessly lost in a maze of twisty little macros like the OP said, if the original author wasn't good at both designing good abstractions and documenting them.) Haskell because it has so many unusual abstractions that you must learn before you can understand others' code or write effective code yourself. I think I prefer Haskell's form of Hell, because it's strongly typed, more modern, and better-planned-out, but I'm not really satisfied with either of them.

I like having a Lisp-style macro system available, but I think creating a macro system so people can <b>write</b> macros is the wrong approach. What I want from a macro system is a good set of well-designed macros designed by professionals, that everybody knows, so that you rarely need to write a new macro of your own.<br/><br/>Haskell, similarly, has a lot of good things to offer, but pure functional programming is not a form of thought that comes naturally, nor is the various abstractions based on higher mathematics.<br/><br/>I actually think it's important to teach some of these abstractions and probably someday they will be a part of every school curriculum - but I think a good programming language embraces diverse forms of thought - imperative, declarative, functional, domain-specific - and allows programmers to write programs in a way that resembles the way they think about the problem they're solving. The role of the programming language is not to enforce "purity", but to provide rich, intuitive functionality and to guide people into the "pit of success" - by making the probably-better way of doing things easier than the probably-worse way.<br/><br/>Short pit-of-success example: in languages like JavaScript creating a global variable is super easy, but a member variable must be accessed through "this", as in <tt>this.v</tt>. This should be flipped on its head so the member variable is easy to reach and the global variable is written <tt>global.v</tt>.
