Found a few surprisingly active apps and communities, some with millions of downloads and hundreds of user-contributed mini-apps.\n\nThese all come with visual programming interfaces, showing that there's life in that approach for a mass non-tech user market beyond edtech, and for a post-Excel user community.\n\nThere's Tasker, Macrodroid and Automate for device automation, which have evolved into quite general-purpose programming ecosystems, with active forums and user-contributed content.\n\nThere's Airtable, MobiDB, MementoDB which combine databases with varying degrees of spreadsheet-style programmability.\n\nThere's Pocket Code, Roblox and Ready Maker, for writing your own games, and Sketchware for writing your own games and apps. Roblox has a very active (teen, Lua) programmer community. Pocket Code also has a very active sharing community.\n\nSo these are the competition for my own project, and probably for anyone else here writing a mass-market, mobile-ready system for non-techies to program?",

Found a few surprisingly active apps and communities, some with millions of downloads and hundreds of user-contributed mini-apps.\n\nThese all come with visual programming interfaces, showing that there's life in that approach for a mass non-tech user market beyond edtech, and for a post-Excel user community.\n\nThere's Tasker, Macrodroid and Automate for device automation, which have evolved into quite general-purpose programming ecosystems, with active forums and user-contributed content.\n\nThere's Airtable, MobiDB, MementoDB which combine databases with varying degrees of spreadsheet-style programmability.\n\nThere's Pocket Code, Roblox and Ready Maker, for writing your own games, and Sketchware for writing your own games and apps. Roblox has a very active (teen, Lua) programmer community. Pocket Code also has a very active sharing community.\n\nSo these are the competition for my own project, and probably for anyone else here writing a mass-market, mobile-ready system for non-techies to program?"

Not a loaded question; I’m genuinely curious what Swift is missing to be perceived this way.\n\nA full tool set every bit as good the new XCode with 1st class quality GUI and graphics frameworks that runs on and\/or exports to Windows, Linux, Android.\n\n4 out 5 people or more are not on Apple hardware.\n\nI'd love to learn Swift but I can't justify iOS or MacOS only at the moment. The experience might be great but I still need to ship on either Android or Windows or both. As such I'm more likely to pick a worse language if it means I can write once or closer to once.\n\nI've shipped a 4 or 5 small electron apps. I know people have strong feelings about shipping an entire browser and the JS\/HTML\/CSS stack but from a productivity POV it's amazing.\n\nThere are open source repos that will generate mac\/windows\/linux binaries and\/or installers in one step. The API is 99% consistent across platforms. Yes I know it's not the native UI but for many apps it's good enough. Tons of people are using the native slack up daily and enjoying it. Even 10000s of programmers on Macs are running VSCode and loving it.\n\nAnyway, I've built small per project tools with simple forms or GUIs or graph displays. I write them on Mac send them to my clients on Windows.\n\nI'd love a better language and a better environment but who's offering one that's cross platform? The only other thing I've considered because of ease of use is Unity. It's game oriented but one click will generate an app for a myriad of platforms and I know people who have used it for non-game apps just because the cross platform story works so well. It also has various kinds of live updating\n\nSure there are things like Qt\/C++ but IIRC most of them require actually having a fully setup dev environment with tons of tools installed on every target platform. Electron is pretty much just `git clone ... &amp;&amp; npm install &amp;&amp; npm run dist` and everything just magically happens. It's easy to see why lots of devs opt for it",

The experience might be great but I still need to ship on either Android or Windows or both. As such I'm more likely to pick a worse language if it means I can write once or closer to once.\n\nI've shipped a 4 or 5 small electron apps. I know people have strong feelings about shipping an entire browser and the JS\/HTML\/CSS stack but from a productivity POV it's amazing.\n\nThere are open source repos that will generate mac\/windows\/linux binaries and\/or installers in one step. The API is 99% consistent across platforms. Yes I know it's not the native UI but for many apps it's good enough. Tons of people are using the native slack up daily and enjoying it. Even 10000s of programmers on Macs are running VSCode and loving it.\n\nAnyway, I've built small per project tools with simple forms or GUIs or graph displays. I write them on Mac send them to my clients on Windows.\n\nI'd love a better language and a better environment but who's offering one that's cross platform? The only other thing I've considered because of ease of use is Unity. It's game oriented but one click will generate an app for a myriad of platforms and I know people who have used it for non-game apps just because the cross platform story works so well. It also has various kinds of live updating\n\nSure there are things like Qt\/C++ but IIRC most of them require actually having a fully setup dev environment with tons of tools installed on every target platform. Electron is pretty much just "

In places like HN it seems an even more typical reaction but it seems an extremely popular reaction in tech circles.\n\nWhy is that? I find this a genuinely interesting question to ask, because I think it tells us something about our culture and our values.\n\nWhy put the novelty of a technology above all else? Comments like that appear like something that isn't new doesn't deserve attention.

I suspect there's some lizard-brain evolutionary territory thing going on, which I don't think is healthy for us as a community.\n\nShouldn't we celebrate that something old but apparently useful was picked up again, given a new spin, perhaps infused with other ideas, or made available to another community beyond the original one?

                "text": "Red is a computer programming language. Red was made to overcome the limitations of the programming language Rebol. Introduced in 2011 by Nenad Rakocevic, Red is both an imperative and functional programming language. Its syntax and general usage overlaps that of the interpreted Rebol language (which was introduced in 1997).\nThe implementation choices of Red intend to create a full stack programming language: Red can be used for extremely high-level programming (DSLs and GUIs) as well as low-level programming (operating systems and device drivers). Key to the approach is that the language has two parts: Red\/System and Red.\n\nRed\/System is similar to C, but packaged into a Rebol lexical structure –  for example, one would write if x &gt; y [print \"Hello\"] instead of if (x &gt; y) {printf(\"Hello\\n\");}.\nRed is a homoiconic language capable of meta-programming, with semantics similar to Rebol's. Red's runtime library is written in Red\/System, and uses a hybrid approach: it compiles what it can deduce statically and uses an embedded interpreter otherwise. The project roadmap includes a just-in-time compiler for cases in between, but this has not yet been implemented.Red seeks to remain independent of any other toolchain; it does its own code generation. It is therefore possible to cross-compile Red programs from any platform it supports to any other, via a command-line switch. Both Red and Red\/System are distributed as open-source software under the modified BSD license. The runtime library is distributed under the more permissive Boost Software License.\nBy version 0.6.4 Red includes a garbage collector \"the Simple GC\".",
