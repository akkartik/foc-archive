                "text": "The Recursive InterNetwork Architecture (RINA) is a new computer network architecture proposed as an alternative to the currently mainstream TCP\/IP model. The RINA's fundamental principles are that computer networking is just Inter-Process Communication or IPC, and that layering should be done based on scope\/scale, with a single recurring set of protocols, rather than function, with specialized protocols. The protocol instances in one layer interface with the protocol instances on higher and lower layers via new concepts and entities that effectively reify networking functions currently specific to protocols like BGP, OSPF and ARP. In this way, the RINA proposes to support features like mobility, multi-homing and Quality of Service without the need for extra specialized protocols like RTP and UDP, as well as allow simplified network administration without the need for concepts like autonomous systems and NAT.",
