This week I've implemented serialization format for machines built in Automat. Simple JSON file (pretty-printed) stored next to the executable. Turns out its quite handy during interactive development. And also opens the way for regression testing. Restoring the window state was (surprisingly) the hardest challenge (due to DPI and monitors) and I didn't manage to correctly persist it. Both on Linux and Windows, the window managers just don't want to share some of the window properties... (especially around window tiling)
