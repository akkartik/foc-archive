I love playful and creative interactions for storytelling, teaching, etc.\n\nFor more context in the present, I’m a recent Ph.D. graduate from New York University, and I focused on human-computer interaction exploring how we could combine natural creativity, communication, and programming into an interactive communication medium of its own, in a sense. The specific project I did towards that exploration is <https:\/\/ktrosenberg.github.io\/drawtalking\/|DrawTalking (Building Interactive Worlds by Sketching and Speaking),> and I’d love to share it here. It’s both my thesis and my playground for coming up with ideas.\n\nAlso, I’m really hoping to meet people here! I’m looking forward to conversations and even meet-ups if there are people in the NYC area or nearby. Nice to meet you all in advance!",
