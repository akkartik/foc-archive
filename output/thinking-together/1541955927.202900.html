The problem with OOP: everyone is so focused on building programs by modelling dogs and mammals, but they missed the fact that programs are more like verbs instead of nouns.

For me using objects as verbs turned out to work really well to model complex domains =)

I feel like OOP is just a tool. Maybe I don't know what OOP means to everyone else. Like a feel like being able to put a bunch of shapes in a list List&lt;Shape&gt; where concrete shapes are Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, etc is a useful concept. Or that semi standard command pattern that's useful for apps and gives you nearly free undo, redo, scripting language integration, etc.. I don't really know a better way. Another example might be some IO/stream API where I want to pass in some abstract concept of a stream and that stream might be file, it might be a zip file, etc, it might be some in memory file, etc...<br/><br/>But I certainly agree OOP can be overused and it's certainly frustrating to have factory factory factories etc.<br/><br/>I just sometimes don't know what the alternative is. For example functional programming doesn't seem like an alternative to all problems. Somethings actually have state and can't easily be duplicated/discarded/GCed automagically. Files and GPU resources come to mind but it's certainly possible I'm just aware of the patterns that deal with that fact outside of stateful objects.

Definitely a tool to me as well. A tool for thinking about and building models of dynamic processes.<br/><br/>It's also a very ill-defined term and most people probably think about type-based polymorphism and object-oriented design - most prominently GoF and JEE.<br/><br/>But to me OOP has nothing to do with classes, types, inheritance or patterns and I don't see it as an anti-thesis to FP. Instead, I prefer Kay's definition: "OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and<br/>hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things. It<br/>can be done in Smalltalk and in LISP."

The problem with OOP is that it facilitates having more state (the only significant difference between OOP and FP is that objects provide a namespace to hang state variables off of). State is the largest source of unexpected results in programing. It means functions can have unexpected side effects (by modifying state), and it also means the surface area for bugs gets increase by an order of magnitude (each function in your class now needs needs be tested with all significant permutations its instance variables can be in). When you do need to have state OOP is a useful (the best?) paradigm for managing it. Gary Bernhardt's "Boundaries" is a great talk on when and how to use OOP and FP in the same application <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries</a>

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nikolas Martens</span> The kind of OOP you're referring to is perhaps more precisely known as "the actor model". I prefer this term because it's unambiguous.

Good idea. The Actor model does incorporate the most important parts about OOP and it's properly defined.
