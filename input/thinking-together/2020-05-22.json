I have been going through listening to all the podcasts from the start because I find this whole topic deeply fascinating and want to make sure im up to date with everything before I start contributing here. I have one question however. In episode 3 \"Inventing on Principle\" with Jonathan Leung.\n\n<@U5TCAFTD3> and Jonathan discuss a whole bunch of really interesting things but Jonathan talks about an app I think he calls \"Workflow\" that he uses whenever he works on a task to help him structure how he tackles the problem. He mentions that he has shown the technique to many other people and they have all adopted it since. I would love to know more about this App and \/ or technique. Does anyone have any sources?",
