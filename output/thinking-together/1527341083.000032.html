I know this all sounds esoteric and pedantic when what we really want is just a better way to program, but I'm particularly fed up with our relationship between the higher level languages and the underlying computer. I feels to me (I wish I had something less subjective than "feels") that the assembly language and machine language interface that we all attempt to compile out programs down into is part of the problem -- That is, it restricts our thinking of what is possible with computable machines.

I deeply share the feeling that the existing systems restrict (and bias) our thinking in certain ways. 'Compiling down' a program is itself a specific 'frame of thinking' - i.e. one must write a 'program' in full, like a paper, and 'submit' to a another program to be verified and/or compiled. As one alternative, you could imagine incrementally specifying constraints while a solver constructs the system you are describing live and shows you the effects live.<br/><br/>Another aspect that comes to mind when working with large systems is why do we describe exactly one 'os process' as a program, which we then deploy as one small piece of a larger system (~100s of distinct processes interacting with each other)? The way we reason about and construct one process is so different than the larger system, but in the end the computation power is no different. Is it possible to define the larger system as 'one program' that we can reason about? How would we update a smaller part of such a system?<br/><br/>Yet another aspect is the single view - the program is considered to have a single canonical view (typically text based) - is this a good model?

Yeah, the complex interactions in an OS are a lot to reason about, especially when you are concerned about soft-realtimeness of a UI. There's too much going on.

As for the large complete program at once, I wonder if the spreadsheet is a good example of something that allows for incremental discovery of what we are building.

I like spreadsheets as a starting point - they have affordances that expose the single level structure clearly and make discovery easier. Also you can represent a few different views of the contents in the same medium, unlike text blob editing. Once you go into a cell you're still back to text though.<br/><br/>I think what I was trying to get at earlier is the contrast between the 'program' and the 'system'. Using 'programs' is only one of many possible way to desing and build a larger 'system'. Could there be other ways to decompose and build/modify a system? Could I, for instance, have a model where I explore a system to easily discover the various componenets (and sub-components and so on), and when I find what i'm looking for, modify it 'in-place'. The 'component' modified here might be very small, e.g. equivalent to a function. This is very different from what it takes to modify a single function in a large running system today. Everything from discovery, explorability to update requires knowledge of various intermediate systems (source control, build systems, compilers, deployment systems, 'the process model').
