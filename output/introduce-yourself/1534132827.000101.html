Hey all. Introductions? Ok, well, I made video games for 25+ years C64-&gt;PS3, worked on the Chrome GPU team at Google making WebGL, and stumbled on the Future of Coding podcast recently.<br/><br/>I don't know if have anything to add but I am interested in the topic. I wrote a simple signal based visual programming system for a game I worked on. I worked with a visual programming system called "Virtools" in like 2004. I also got lucky and by chance got to visit Dynamicland last March. I would love to discuss all that stuff somewhere and learn more.
