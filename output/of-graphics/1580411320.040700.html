There's a nice proof-of-concept app called Enklu that's designed to be used with a HoloLens and a desktop together. You get an environment scan from the HoloLens into the app, use your hands to position stuff in it, and add your game logic at a regular keyboard and monitor that you can see. End product is a QR code you distribute to other HoloLens users who can walk through the scanned location. (Too glitchy for practical use last I tried it, but live updating from a real-world scanned environment synced between two apps is non-trivial!)
