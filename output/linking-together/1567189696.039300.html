I would argue that AirTable is an entirely different kind of product than a spreadsheet, which is a very specific tool like a hammer. I view AirTable as a collaborative database with various modules, some of which resemble spreadsheets. One could argue that it is merger of those two worlds (spreadsheet and database) that has not been seen much since the very old Framework product that Robert Carr wrote in the 80's.  Framework got so hot they did TV advertising for it; when was the last time you saw a TV commercial for consumer software?
