In lieu of an update video, here's a super-wide screenshot of my Live Coding tool; showing the audio components.<br/>I've spent the last few weeks fixing the build system to use vcpkg (this is a massive change, but a massive improvement too; it should really reduce the time I waste making builds work. It also makes my CMake files smaller and simpler).  I estimate I spend 25% of my time fixing cross platform builds/CI. etc.  This has to stop; I have lost weeks to figuring out all these issues.  Discovering that vcpkg solves most of my problems was a revelation; it is laughably easy to build complex libraries and link them into your projects.<br/>I've also been updating to the ImGui docking branch. This is going to be great for live coding; giving you more surface area to put your various windows and tools. This screenshot is an example across my 3 monitors; I will shortly have the visual pieces up and running too.
