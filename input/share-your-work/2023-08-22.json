They might ask, \"Why should typical computer users bother learning to program?\" Well, that's the wrong question! Instead, we should start broader. Why do we use computers? What do we use them to do? What happens when they don't do what we want? Who controls what they do? Will this ever change? What change do we want? Nardi challenges us to explore these questions, and gives the reader a gentle but definitive push in a positive direction.\n\nAlso of note â€” we've launched a <http:\/\/patreon.com\/futureofcoding|Patreon>!
