        "text": "Some criticisms, mostly of my own failure to communicate what was in my mind with this exercise.\n\n_Problem statements_\n\nI think many problem statements were infected by the solution in the mind of the author. Phrases like \"there oughta be\" or \"the world needs\" are red flags of this failure mode. I think all my 6s were because of this. Either your problem is intensely personal, and you're doing art for art's sake (perfectly legitimate! see Jackson Pollock or Van Gogh!) or I think there's room here to make your problem less muddy, to give it a more separate existence from the solution you're working on.\n\nA lesser failure mode: Phrases like \"because\" and \"due to\" are red flags that you're over-specifying an approach to a problem. There seems some value in more focus. If problem A seems to have sub-problem B, do you care about B in isolation, or A as a whole? Pick one. If it's A, be open to other approaches. If it's B, then it should be able to stand alone as a resonant problem. (I made this mistake as well in an earlier thread, <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/C5T9GPWFL\/p1718449988190349?thread_ts=1718448593.662299&cid=C5T9GPWFL|and even had a sub-sub-problem>; the instinct to boil the ocean is very powerful but misguided.)\n\n<@U6KQ2S410>: what are some examples of special-purpose technologies? A single editor window containing say some Lua code without any libraries seems to me to be \"not shattered\", but it's still certainly likely to contain friction and complexity, particularly to people inexperienced with programming. Perhaps what would help is stating the target demographic. Do you care about just programmers or just non-programmers or both or something else? Perhaps I should have asked everyone to mention that in problem statements..\n\n_Reactions to problem statements_\n\n<https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/C5T9GPWFL\/p1722838639110989?thread_ts=1722660123.009799&cid=C5T9GPWFL|Konrad Hinsen read my levels 4 and 5> with a tacit \"in the context of my work\" to them. \"There are problem statements here whose background and motivation I can perfectly well understand, but which I don't see as important in my own work.\" I would tend to categorize those as level 3, so it looks like my rubric is ambiguously worded. I'm curious how others interpreted my levels, and if they see other potential room for ambiguity.\n\nSpecial mention to <@UC2A2ARPT> for willfully stretching the rules of the game both in problem statements and reactions. My star map didn't know what to do with vectors, ranges like 0-5, negative numbers and complex numbers :laughing: Thanks for playing sportingly, even though it seems clear that you don't really care about thinking in terms of problems, in the vein of Pollock and Van Gogh..",

There seems some value in more focus. If problem A seems to have sub-problem B, do you care about B in isolation, or A as a whole? Pick one. If it's A, be open to other approaches. If it's B, then it should be able to stand alone as a resonant problem. (I made this mistake as well in an earlier thread, "

This is long, sorry.\n\nKartik Agaram: 1–5\n> Adapting computers to ourselves is hard.\nWhat does it mean to \"adapt a computer\" to myself? Why is it hard? Is it a bad thing that it's hard (eg: escaping poverty) or a good thing (eg: playing the oboe)? When you \"adapt\" a computer, what changes? It seems like you could change *anything* about a computer, and it would have some effect on how one uses it. What adaptations might you (Kartik) have had in mind? Perhaps, being able to reshape the editors we use to do our writing and coding? If we made that easier to do, would that solve any of my problems? Would it help me solve my problems? What are my problems? Well, one of them is that I don't get any sensations in my body while I code, other than leg pain and headache. Whereas, for everything else I enjoy doing, I get all sorts of sensations. When I solve the problem \"my family needs to eat this week\" by making a big batch of pasta sauce, I get to smell the garlic and oregano cooking in butter and oil. When I play guitar and get a melodic idea, I get the sport-like feeling of trying to make my fingers (and the rest of my body) execute the melody, over and over, until I can play it easily… and then I get to react to the weird feelings my body produces while I play it, and have that push me toward different ways of playing it, or playing different things, which turn into new melodic ideas. There's an interplay between mind and body that the computer doesn't participate in. So when I say that my problem is \"I've never seen an approach to programming that centers animation\", it's a one sentence way of saying \"bodies are amazing, and computers only suction-cup themselves around our eyeballs and finger tips, so at the very least they could do that a little more richly, and try to produce more sensations\". That feels a *ton* like \"adapting computers to ourselves\". If that's what you were getting at, then on the scale of 1-6, that'd be a 0 — I realized something new about my problem by reading your problem. But if you mean, like, it should be easier for novice programmers to learn the field without being struck with vertigo when they first glimpse the size of the complexity tower they'll inherit, or, put another way, the computing environment we find ourselves in should be more human-scale, that's a 3. But if you mean, like, we need our technical foundations (like, ecosystems, platforms… x86 and UIKit and the web) to be more open for us to reshape, well, that's a 5.\n\nKonrad Hinsen: 6 (but ironic)\n> [...] Agency over information processing systems is too centralized. Too many people have to adapt to someone else's systems, rather than adapting their own system to their own wishes. [...]\nGiven my problem as expressed above, I don't see how information processing centralization is even a problem of the same sort. Like, I can see how it exacerbates other problems, but I don't see it as a root cause. So that's the 6.
