Hello everyone <a href="!here">!here</a>,<br/><br/>I have something I would love to hear your feedback on: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcFe9E5_P44&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLwia5ezffHz7GLSDx27yxHn4ueIct4j9u">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcFe9E5_P44&amp;index=4&amp;&hellip;</a><br/><br/>I'm interested in any thoughts you have but mostly:<br/>- is the video/sound quality sufficient or annoyingly bad?<br/>- did you feel like you could follow along or was it confusing?<br/>- would you be interested in the next demo?<br/><br/>Thanks a lot for taking the time :smiley:

Hi Nikolas,<br/>the quality is really good. Your voice is easy to understand and the background noises aren't annoying in my opinion. I was able to follow along quite well, but I think I didn't get "the greater picture". Maybe I should have watched the earlier demos, but I was missing an initial motivation (mostly which problems you want to solve and a general description of your idea/approach). The stuff you showed is really cool, but from the demo I don't know how that could be useful for me. The visualization of messages being sent between nodes is neat. I think that for demos you could slow that down even more so that it's easier to understand what's going on. And yep, I'd watch another demo :wink:

Thanks for the feedback Felix :smiley:<br/>You're definitely right about the greater picture. The demo is just showing the model visualization, but I don't intend it to be an introduction for the project. Thing is, I still don't have a good introduction since I'm still not really sure what I'm going for. But as I'm moving along, my vision is getting clearer so I might write up something soon. Next demo hopefully contains some UI which should make it a lot clearer.
