Does the work of these guys have any relation to the stuff here at FoC? <a href="https://stdlib.com/">https://stdlib.com/</a>

This is similar to Zappier and IFTTT, yes? In that case, yes, it's somewhat related to what some of us are working on. <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Peak</span> is working on something like this, but I believe with more flexibility. There are a few people here from Webflow, which is similarly interested in the "low-code" movement that this Standard Library project probably belongs to. They call Standard Library "visual", which would put it squarely in the realm that I haunt, but I'd quibble with their claim.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan</span> yes, we at Storyscript are kinda like Stdlib but more flexible, and a new language which comes with a lot of abstraction bonuses. Our opinion is that “visual programming” is more complex and opaque than traditional textual programming (however Storyscript is not traditional at all as the text is complete with data, event, infra and orchestration abstractions that no other language can do by design). DM me for demos.

I would classify StdLib not as a language, but as a utility program that is clearly slanted towards generating SMS messages. So a kind of front end for Twilio which they are using for the back end to handle SMS integration. Their free tier offers a lot of usage, so they must have a "burn cash while growing" business model.

Ok, so is this StdLib a lower level thing that some FoC projects could use underneath as an implementation model, or am I totally misunderstanding it? I guess I am really trying hard to learn about the landscape of StoryScript and other FAAS/event driven type languages so that I can connect the dots and assess them
