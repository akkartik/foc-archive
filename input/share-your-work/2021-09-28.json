I’ve (<https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tomascerkasas\/>, <https:\/\/github.com\/toinbis>) been identifying myself professionally as a `growth hacker` for the past 10 years already.

It is at the same time attempt to introduce `ubiquitous language` (in domain-driven-design (DDD) context) for daily communication in marketing+development teams cooperation.\n\nIn an attempt to de-mystify some common myths of what `growth hackers(marketing communication specialists)` actually do and how `developers\/admins\/devopsers\/u-name-it` could help them do their work better (or at least stop creating huge roadblocks, such as instroducing react&amp;friends in acquisition funnel websites, to give an example) - *I would like to propose to an online webinar for FoC community those above mentioned `how to tell a story via web medium` trainings* (free of charge) .\n\nPlease put :heavy_plus_sign: if you’d be interested in joining this webinar.
