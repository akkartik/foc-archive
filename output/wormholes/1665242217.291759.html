It's <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/blackcountrymuseums/4366927107/">commonly assumed</a> that the distance between the ends of a wormhole is much greater outside than inside. Wormholes might someday let us see or travel to otherwise inaccessible places far across the universe, or even beyond it, without the need for faster-than-light travel. But the opposite might also be true. Every wormhole might be scrunched and twisty, like the intestines of space itself. You must wriggle your way through the wormhole, and in so doing travel much further inside than the crow flies out. Crows eat worms, after all.
