Towards that end I am taking another run at the old ideas of macro recording and Programming by Example. Many such efforts abstracted user actions into conventional code. Instead I co-design the PL and UI to be analogous, so that programs and users have much the same capabilities, and programs look much like recorded transcripts of user actions. Conscientiously following this design principle leads in the opposite direction of current PL trends, towards a deeply imperative semantics and a de-emphasis of functional abstraction.\n\nAny attempt to make programming more concrete faces two challenges: loops and conditionals, for they necessarily deal with hypothetical situations. My approach is to extend the direct manipulation metaphor onto _template_ states that prototype iteration, and _example_ states that witness alternative cases.",

One view is to show data, operation, data, operation.  It's like a command-line transcript, but structured rather than text.  The other is more like a traditional GUI where you manipulate an object in place.  You can imagine this as stacking transformations.  Then switching between these views is just a matter of rotation.  From there you can go wild.  One natural path is to allow for branching and merging.  (In the context of tables, merging nodes often correspond to joins.)  If you aren't careful you find yourself in parametric modeling node-and-edges land.  I don't know if madness is the final destination, but at least you end up with a kind space of interaction modalities in which familiar conventions are projections.",
