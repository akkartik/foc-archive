<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Wouter van Oortmerssen</span> By recycling I mean the following: a system runs as long as its valuable, but when the environment changes (due to new situations, new laws, more/less/different users etc) the system should change with it. In other words, we should reuse the parts we want, but get rid of the others and refurbish them for new purposes. I have met many companies that would choose to not have their systems, or at least have them in a different shape. This is not sustainable.
