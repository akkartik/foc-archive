Just a brief note on gender and FoC. I do research in academia, primarily in the fields of programming languages (PL) and human-computer interaction (HCI). I visited the PLATEAU workshop (about PL/HCI topics) for the last two years, and half the attendees identify as female. HCI is the only female-majority field in CS research (to my knowledge). PL is still male-imbalanced, but my perception is that it’s gotten a LOT better in the last few years.<br/><br/>How awesome is that! So many people from diverse backgrounds are getting excited about the future of coding, and contributing knowledge/tools to make programming more powerful and accessible to everyone.<br/><br/>I fully support Ivan in his efforts to make the FoC community more welcoming. We *<b>need</b>* the smarts &amp; perspective of people beyond our own backgrounds. We should categorically reject group-identity-based reasoning like “women are more interested in people, there is nothing morally wrong about having 100% male community”.<br/><br/>No human is a statistic. No one deserves to be excluded due to their gender, race, or any other innate attribute.
