<pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">There are, of course, the explicit computer processes which we use, and which our philosophy requires the augmented man to be able to design and build for himself. A number of people, outside our research group here, maintain stoutly that a practical augmentation system should not require the human to have to do any computer programming -- they feel that this is too specialized a capability to burden people with. Well, what that means in our eyes, if translated to a home workshop, would be like saying that you can't require the operating human to know how to adjust his tools, or set up jigs, or change drill sizes, and the like. You can see there that these skills are easy to learn in the context of what the human has to learn anyway about using the tools, and that they provide for much greater flexibility in finding convenient ways to use the tools to help shape materials.</pre><br/>I wonder how similar was the term <tt>computer programming</tt> for D.

My guess is that it is very similar. At least if you take programming at a very broad sense (as I do): any task which aims at specifying some computer behavior. The augmented people need programming tools (and need to "understand" them) to help them design and build new artefacts that help them think.

That term was very similar, perhaps. I find it more interesting to reflect on how the terms <em>user</em> and <em>programmer</em> have changed since then.<br/><br/>Back then, computers weren't as commercialized, but also not as widely spread as they are today. The distinction between users and programmers was much smaller or didn't really exist, because back then, if you were using a computer, you were likely programming it.<br/><br/>Reading Engelbart, or any of the other early computer pioneers, you pick up this enthusiastic spirit of possibility that personal computers will one day become a new medium (I believe Alan Kay later called it "personal dynamic medium") that will finally enable everyone to express themselves much more creatively, because it was interactive.<br/><br/>But commercial uses of computers in businesses were more after automation than augmentation. And then the WWW happened and there was lots of money to be made in dumbed-down experiences that didn't require users to "learn the tool" at all. Just click the blue underlined text or what looks like a button.<br/><br/>On the plus side, now almost everybody has a smartphone and knows how to navigate the web and communicate through social media. But there is so much more power in that little device in everybody's handsâ€¦
