Let's generalize spreadsheets beyond tables.\n2. Spreadsheets often grow too complex to debug, and bugs are often missed. Let's improve spreadsheets to be easier to debug.\n\nI've long suspected both these endeavors to be doomed. If you focus on just one side the other will get you. And if you try to focus on both the problem ends up getting too constrained.\n\nThe issue here is that both problems are Romanticist in their framing. Here's a Classicist reframing: spreadsheets are great for non-programmers but they're _fundamentally incomplete_. Let's use spreadsheets as a gateway drug to teach people to test what they build, value simple solutions over complex ones, decouple solutions into sub-systems, etc.\n\nI'm starting to think Alan Kay and Bret Victor would agree with this. The new steelman model of them in my head agrees that tools need to help people change, but just hasn't found a way to clearly communicate this nuance at scale. Their fundamental goal is to inspire.",

Let's generalize spreadsheets beyond tables.\n2. Spreadsheets often grow too complex to debug, and bugs are often missed. Let's improve spreadsheets to be easier to debug.\n\nI've long suspected both these endeavors to be doomed. If you focus on just one side the other will get you. And if you try to focus on both the problem ends up getting too constrained.\n\nThe issue here is that both problems are Romanticist in their framing. Here's a Classicist reframing: spreadsheets are great for non-programmers but they're "

Let's use spreadsheets as a gateway drug to teach people to test what they build, value simple solutions over complex ones, decouple solutions into sub-systems, etc.\n\nI'm starting to think Alan Kay and Bret Victor would agree with this. The new steelman model of them in my head agrees that tools need to help people change, but just hasn't found a way to clearly communicate this nuance at scale. Their fundamental goal is to inspire."
