There could be a really strong <em>domain-specific</em> angle to this. For instance, when working on Max patches, I already have a mic plugged in to the computer, so that I can feed it nonsense echolalia mouth noises as test data for the patch. Perhaps you could flip the mic input in and out of "edit mode" the same way you do for mouse/keyboard input (just like Hypercard, for those who don't know Max). That'd be nice in the cases where my keyboard and mouse are all the way <em>over there</em>, on the far side of a pile of instruments, and I just want to make a quick tweak â€” set a midi foot pedal to toggle mic edit mode.
