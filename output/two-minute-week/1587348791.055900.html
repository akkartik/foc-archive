<b>Edward de Jong</b>  [7:03 PM]<br/>Per Ivan's suggestion for making weekly progress videos, I have made a 2 minute video on Beads, showing off the beginnings of the IDE that will allow the programmer to use a graphical user interface to construct part of the code. <a href="https://youtu.be/ao5Ivml6sr0">https://youtu.be/ao5Ivml6sr0</a><br/><br/>I had originally intended that Beads would be a purely textual language, but customer feedback is overwhelmingly requesting graphical aids and high interactivity. Certainly, for the graphical parts of coding, and that is a lot of the process, it will be much easier than typing. The key advantage of graphical interfaces is that you can constrain the visibility and presentation of options so that it is nearly impossible to have an invalid state. Textual coding has lots of tiny typographical errors, and that frustrates people. As i progress on this process of graphicalization i will find out how far you can actually take a language that is very Pythonic  into this space. The output of the IDE is the canonical text form of the language, which will allow programs last a lot longer. Different IDE's will spring up over time, and the internal form of a document from an IDE is highly IDE specific. Just for "diff" reasons you need a text form that can be compared and updated. So a graphical system that stores into text format is a very sound idea. I know that the Luna people are doing a similar thing. Anyway please let me know if the video is tolerable. It seems a little fuzzy; i uploaded it at 720p but maybe not enough pixels.<br/><br/>The IDE for Beads is written in itself, and shows very good compactness as it is only 15k words (approx 4000 lines) so far.

This was a nice sample of what you're working on. I hope you'll do more videos in the weeks to come, so that we can see more of the facets of your project. I haven't played with beads yet, so this video gave me a little more of a sense of it (in the bits of text you showed near the start)

is the core language close to 1.0? is there some big part missing?

I also wondered about the UI; thought it might be customized ImGui?

The IDE is written entirely in the Beads language. The IDE code is a single file, posted in my SDK, all the controls were written in Beads and are therefore malleable, and it has no dependencies beyond the standard runtime library of the language. The Beads language is designed to replace the HTML/JS/CSS/Database/Framework stack, as well as Android Studio/Java and XCode/Swift stacks, with a single language.  At present it emits code for either AS3/Adobe Air or JS which is what you are seeing in the demo. The only big thing missing at this moment is integration with the scrolling of the browser.

Flattening into one clean and simple language - that's awesome!
