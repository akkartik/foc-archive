Hey there, I'm Jacob. Have been curious about languages for a long time, and programming languages for a slightly shorter amount of time. Not particularly formally educated in either area, but I do enjoy poking around PL environments. Smug Lisp weenie (without a job in Lisp though, so as a hobby only), but I've also been very influenced by my experiences in Smalltalk. Would like to build more environments and less apps, but preferably without inventing a language of my own.
