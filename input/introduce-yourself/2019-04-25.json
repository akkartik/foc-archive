I do web development with Oracles newly rebranded low code tool called Application Express (Apex for short but not to be confused with Salesforce).\n\nI find I keep coming back to ideas around better languages, better tools, and developer experience and somehow found this group last night. For me it seems like we are swimming in place and I guess I feel like I'm smart enough to want to find a way out of this mouse maze and into a better one.",
