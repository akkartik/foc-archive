Hey friends, it's been sometime since I posted an update on Gadget. For those unfamiliar with Gadget, we're trying to build a development platform that steps in and handles the bs boilerplate/repetitive stuff for you, but then steps out of your way and lets you code when you prefer. The platform is nearing completion and launch, if anyone is interested in playing with the alpha, ping me.<br/><br/>This demo is. a bit longer (20 min) but in that time, I build and productionize a full set of APIs to power a kanban board (with auth, access control and the works) and run some graphQL mutations to show that its all real.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.loom.com/share/732816bb327c4155b61199d2d1733c56">https://www.loom.com/share/732816bb327c4155b61199d2d1733c56</a><br/><br/>Feedback welcome!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mo</span> Love the emphasis on declarative modeling and state machines - I think you guys sell yourselves short when you say it's for "reducing boilerplate". Lots of template/code generators exist that overemphasize ease of getting started, but end up delivering complex solutions when the app scales and people realize what they needed was better architecture, and not 2-days shaved off by skipping boilerplate. Software being hard <b>isn't</b> about mundane tasks like boilerplate, but rather our focus on easy solutions complecting together into something unmanageable.<br/><br/>What are the semantics around the infrastructure abstraction you guys have in Gadget? Seems like a lot of thought was put into scalability with Kubernetes and Cloud Functions (curious about the use of both, was there a reason why it couldn't be all serverless, or all K8s?), but given the product hasn't launched yet it's not clear how infrastructure is actually handled (terraform templates generated by gadget? custom code serving as the main engine, and cloud functions being the primary user code?). Would love some clarification on this side of the story

and we currently don't actually provision any infrastructure for each app created -- it's all multitenant shared infrastructure right now which is either insane or brilliant, we aren't sure yet. i like the idea of the multitenancy because it lets you super elastically burst and really take advantage of the cloud-ness of a platform like us, you don't have to write any autoscaling code or bake any AMIs or docker containers, it's all done for you, <b>including</b> the database part. I used to work on Shopify's flash sale platform a bunch and I think it informed a lot of my thinking about all of this -- it's really cool for a platform to be able to offer individual tenants access to an unfairly large share of the platform's resources for the select few times they need them, and then not charge them for it all the time, it's something that only platforms can do

because of this though the apps that we run are tied to our infrastructurre pretty closely and aren't yet "exportable" in the sense that you could eject and terraform the same application into a cloud of your choosing. we felt that the coupling to a specific set of infrastructure that we run was worth it from a stability and capability perspective but i think we might lose a few folks that are really sensitive to vendor lock in until we have an eject button

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Harry Brundage</span> Makes sense, thanks for the clarifications! Ameliorating costs across your user base is a good strategy - in fact, if you think about it, GCP/AWS are essentially doing the same thing. Even if you do try to maintain the illusion of "owning your architecture" by deploying CF or terraform yourself.<br/><br/>The main difference being trust - hosted backends run the risk of tying each tenant's success to Gadget's success without a good ejection strategy. Given the serverless nature of the project I don't imagine such an exit strategy would be too difficult to implement, but it's a concern people will have.

one thing that makes me feel a bit crazy is that the big clouds don't seem to be building very many multi tenant datastores. They're definitely doing compute and making the grain of elasticity ever lower, but for most of the stateful stuff you need to specify your resource demands up front and then changing those demands is generally pretty slow

Aurora serverless and FaunaDB both are doing awesome work there but it seems like the place where elasticity would be most valuable (the central bottleneck) is maybe also the hardest to add it

Yeah, agreed. There's also the funny slightly-tinfoil hat explanation that much of it is potentially intentional, or more strictly speaking not a business priority. Good auto-scaling and the equivalent of computational insurance policies would just shave margins of what I suspect is a fat cash-cow from poorly setup auto-scaling groups or lazy devs. It'd be really interesting to see how much of the gap between developer expectation of computational load and actual load translates into profit for cloud vendors.

Cool demo <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mo</span>! Great work <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Harry Brundage</span> &amp; <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mo</span><br/><br/>The demo of state charts is really interesting (cc <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Garth Goldwater</span> @ 6m55s). Garth and I have discussed something similar for the product I'm working on at Storyscript, but instead of opening up to any state transitions, narrowing down to prioritize representing linear state progressions, as in:<br/><tt>Opened (Task Name)</tt> -&gt;<br/>+ <tt>In progress(Due Date)</tt> -&gt;<br/>+ <tt>Finished(Date Finished)</tt> -&gt;<br/>+ <tt>Accepted(Accepted By)</tt><br/>Where each transition requires the properties of the next state to be defined, and each state is additive of the properties of the previous states. My guess is that the majority of domain models will move in a "linear / acyclic" "additive" way the majority of the time. Another example is order fulfillment for a web store.<br/><br/>What do you all think? Do you all have any ambitious/out-there ideas for the future of state charts &amp; domain modeling?

i think your instincts are right for sure, most things tend to go in those linear states. Mo and I both used to work at Shopify and have a borderline uncomfortably deep familiarity with the state machines powering the shopify order model, and notably there's actually two kind-of-orthogonal ones, one for the financial status and one for the fulfillment status. most of the time, merchants wait till they get all their money before sending out on order, but not always like with net 30 payment processing, or the other way around, they sometimes take the money way way before fulfillment is even possible, like with a kickstarter or pre-order

so we kinda think that while state machines are a really powerful way of modelling this logic, you still end up with a lot of extra transitions between states that happen rarely, but not never, and that can in fact be burdensome when using such a formal way of governing stuff

we hope that by owning the interface our developers are using to construct these state machines we can help with that and accelerate the creation of those not-super-frequently taken transitions, think like click and select 4 states then right click and hit a "create all possible transitions" menu option, easier to delete the ones you don't want than create all the ones you do

one thing we haven't nailed yet is the relationship between those additive validations and the state that something is in, we have a facility for defining one global, always applying set of validations for each model same as Rails or Django or Postgres constraints might work, but i think you are totally right and there's a set of validations that only apply in the later stages of a record's lifecycle that would be nice to model as such
