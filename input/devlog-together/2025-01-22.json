Without dipping too far into spoilers, you have a small selection of tools you can use to fill the screen with grains of sand and then move them around, with _brushes_ (of a sort) that each have a bit of logic (eg: scatter the sand randomly, push the sand downwards, merge sand grains together). What's fun about these _brushes_ (of a sort) is that they apply some behaviour that feels like a computation. So you sort of _brush_ your computation over some data (sand).\n\nOne possibility I've been mulling, that I'd love to hear some ideas for, is a brush that does cellular automata. The brush might use some global grid (discrete) or sense of proximity (continuous), and apply some CA-esq rules depending on the density of the sand. Then you'd just _brush_ that computation onto the sand to advance the state of the CA. Maybe each brush stroke advances the CA one step wherever you apply it, or maybe the CA runs continuously but only where you're brushing. The thing I'm presently brainstorming is… how might one specify the CA-esq rules just using sand and brushes?",
