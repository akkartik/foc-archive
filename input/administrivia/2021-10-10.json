        "text": "Yes, that analogy is often useful. During my years at Google managing big data pipelines I often called myself a \"code plumber\", constantly called to inspect leaks in these huge data pipes.\n\nHowever it's not universal. For example, think about how to apply it to a spreadsheet. You could imagine a spreadsheet as a static mesh of pipes that connect up the grid of cells, but a formula like `=SUM(A1:D8)` is actually doing all the interesting stuff (packet switching?) outside the pipes. And we can't just carve out a special case for spreadsheets. In general it's hard to visualize late-bound code as pipes. Imagine a higher-order function like map.\n\nEven at the lowest levels, think about the fact that the current at the base of a transistor affects whether a current flows between emitter and collector. The key isn't the pipe effect. The key is the switch effect.\n\nOn a more abstract level, I think the pipe metaphor corresponds to operational semantics. The other metaphor available is math (denotational or axiomatic semantics). <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Semantics_(computer_science)>\n\nYou're right that the metaphor makes computing seem more accessible. But I think it hides too much of the \"essential strangeness\" of computers. Metaphors dumb down computers.",

In general it's hard to visualize late-bound code as pipes.

The key isn't the pipe effect. The key is the switch effect.\n\nOn a more abstract level, I think the pipe metaphor corresponds to operational semantics.

Illich talks about systems of technology being used to take power and agency away from individuals and to give that power and agency to large institutions. I want computers to be tools for thought, capable of \"augmenting human intellect\". I want computers and technology to give the user more power. I oppose technology that takes power away from users. There are already social movements addressing bits and pieces of this. Open source\/Free software addresses one issue. The activism against walled gardens and for decentralized computing addresses other issues."
