Also many different changes shouldn't all concentrate on the same function because it hurts code reuse. This sounds pretty ambitious and doesn't really hold in any real system BUT it can be used as a proxy to find problematic areas. Take a look at a git log.

I've done some stats like that on a large-ish project at work and the hotspots (functions which were changed in commits) followed something similar to the zipf distribution.
