Hi there, I'm excited to talk about interesting things with everyone!<br/><br/>• I'm building a p2p offline distributed database in my free time (I have a day job unfortunately).<br/>• I've been really interested in EAV stores / Datalog lately. I think its a really flexible and general model for representing information while also having nice offline-syncing properties.<br/>• I'm considering using Hypercore, but the code is really hard to follow and feels too complicated. Does anyone know any better alternatives for secure p2p append-only log syncing?<br/>• If anyone else is working on something in this domain, I'd <em>love</em> to chat about it.<br/>You can find more about me here: <a href="http://www.chetcorcos.com">www.chetcorcos.com</a>
