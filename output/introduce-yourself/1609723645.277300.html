Hi everyone, I’m Vlad currently SDE @ Amazon.<br/>I’m fascinated by a cluster of things that the following labels approximately points at: Tools For thought, Cognitive Augmentation, Novel HCI approaches, future of programming, personal data infrastructure<br/>Also “malleable software” as I quite enjoy building things that have an immediate impact on my experience of using computers.<br/>And I’m interested in making it easier for people to do that/coming up with ways to make our environment more hackable in general.<br/>Most of my popular OSS work is around enhancing the tools in the areas above (<a href="https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit">https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit</a><a href="https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit,">,</a> <a href="https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki">https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki</a> etc)<br/>Another thing I find fascinating is DSLs (with focus on internal ones). I did a talk on what kind of delightful things you can do to Python to make it better suitable for writing DSLs (<a href="https://twitter.com/VladyslavSitalo/status/1344539651818758144?s=20">https://twitter.com/VladyslavSitalo/status/1344539651818758144?s=20</a> )<br/>-<br/>I’m currently trying to figure out how to work on something within that cluster of things full time. So if people have recommendations for <b>companies they find fascinating in the area - I’d appreciate if you can share them :)</b>
