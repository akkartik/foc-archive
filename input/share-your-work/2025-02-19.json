But I think ideas have been dismissed in needlessly offensive ways. I'm the father of a non-binary child. Saying things like \"weird gender stuff\" in a conversation with non-binary people is not okay. It's not an attack, but it's obviously insensitive. People can be genuinely uncertain and offensive at the same time. I don't think there has been any incivility. But I think we can and should aspire to more than civility. Civil conversations can still be very excluding. Comp Sci conferences are nothing if not civil, and the paper was about how excluding they can be. I'm also not saying what people can or can't say. I'm saying how words have affected me, and maybe others, and asking the speakers to take those effects into account, advising what would be helpful. They get to say things like \"weird gender stuff\", and I get to say things like \"that's offensive, please apologize\". If you want to hold space for people, that's how you do it. By letting people express when the space feels hostile, and allowing people to correct for that. If you can't even make the request, then you are protecting the offense and not the offended. And, I have to say, the idea that emotional reactions are \"off-topic\" has got to be like the definition of toxically masculine. I want all genders to feel comfortable in our conversations, and I don't think that sort of norm is going to help _at all_. For what it's worth, I think everything so far has been constructive, and healthy. If no one but me is offended, and\/or no one cares, that's 100% okay. But I'm too old to give a shit, and too frustrated watching the world around me become increasingly hostile to trans people to say nothing when people are being insensitive about gender issues. If I step over any lines, let me know. But I will tell you if I think the lines are in the wrong place.",

But I think ideas have been dismissed in needlessly offensive ways. I'm the father of a non-binary child. Saying things like \"weird gender stuff\" in a conversation with non-binary people is not okay. It's not an attack, but it's obviously insensitive. People can be genuinely uncertain and offensive at the same time. I don't think there has been any incivility. But I think we can and should aspire to more than civility. Civil conversations can still be very excluding. Comp Sci conferences are nothing if not civil, and the paper was about how excluding they can be. I'm also not saying what people can or can't say. I'm saying how words have affected me, and maybe others, and asking the speakers to take those effects into account, advising what would be helpful. They get to say things like \"weird gender stuff\", and I get to say things like \"that's offensive, please apologize\". If you want to hold space for people, that's how you do it. By letting people express when the space feels hostile, and allowing people to correct for that. If you can't even make the request, then you are protecting the offense and not the offended. And, I have to say, the idea that emotional reactions are \"off-topic\" has got to be like the definition of toxically masculine. I want all genders to feel comfortable in our conversations, and I don't think that sort of norm is going to help "

        "text": "<@U02U0AS3J49> — Completely agree with your reply to my messages. That extra context helps me understand where you were coming from and what you were saying, and I feel quite similarly. With respect to my mention of \"on topic\", I should have been clearer: I didn't see any instances of name-calling, and I don't want this thread to devolve into \"when I said ___ I meant ___\" posts (like this present one) because that's not going to help us reflect on Herman's work. So if there's any way we can avoid that (perhaps by moving such discussions out of this thread), that'd be my preference.\n\n<@UGWUJUZHT>\n\nI don't think the way one parses \"weird gender stuff\" changes what's hurtful about it. My read (not the only one, ofc) is that it suggests that it's inappropriate to be conscious of gender when looking at certain issues. I'm of the belief that it's unwise to separate the human element out of _any_ of the work we do. The work is done by people, in society, for people, always. It doesn't matter if the work is _about_ people or not; it all bears fingerprints. In all of life and society, but especially in computing, there's a plethora of longstanding, intense imbalances between the genders (and races, etc). To address these imbalances, we need to be mindful of them at every turn, in every context we can. We should look at everything we have made and ask, \"why is this the way it is?\" in every way we can. Some people (IME, all of them men) might find it ridiculous to ask questions like, \"what role does gender play in the merit-based selection of papers to accept to a conference?\" But time and again, when people (IME, most of them women) do the work to collect the data, they find heretofore invisible gender-related consequences and influences behind pretty much everything we do. (For instance, I love the <https:\/\/www.fsg.org\/blog\/can-snow-clearing-be-sexist\/|snow plowing> example.)\n\nNow, I need to acknowledge one of my biases that I'm working on: all the above is a very _binary_ way of looking at the matter. I talked about \"imbalances between the genders\", which strongly implies that I hold a binary view of gender. And, hey, I do by default think of gender as binary. I'm wrong to do that, but I have a whole life of habit to unpack. I'm not far enough along to speak as confidently about it as I can about, say, the imbalances between men and women. In some ways it's as simple as \"just don't do that\", but to echo Jason, that's treating the symptom and not the disease. So apologies for being a bit clunky about this.\n\n&gt; We certainly benefit from Hermans' talk and discussion of the issues and observations about a years-long \"experiment\", but, that doesn't necessarily mean that Hermans' _theory_ is correct.\n&gt; Hermans' did call for more science.\n&gt; The scientific way to check out a theory is to criticize it while keeping in mind that the criticisms might fail to disprove the theory.\nCan you point to where Hermans suggested we take a scientific approach to resolving the issues raised in her paper? I don't doubt it's something she could have said, but I want to be sure we're not putting words in her mouth.",

We should look at everything we have made and ask, \"why is this the way it is?\" in every way we can. Some people (IME, all of them men) might find it ridiculous to ask questions like, \"what role does gender play in the merit-based selection of papers to accept to a conference?\" But time and again, when people (IME, most of them women) do the work to collect the data, they find heretofore invisible gender-related consequences and influences behind pretty much everything we do.

I'm not far enough along to speak as confidently about it as I can about, say, the imbalances between men and women.
