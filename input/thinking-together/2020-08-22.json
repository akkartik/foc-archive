        "text": "*Imperative programming and math pedagogy:*\nTLDR; converting an algorithm or concept from a research paper into imperative code is often seen as tedious, but I think the process helps with learning and clarifying understanding. This is an underrated advantage of imperative code.\n\nThoughts? Do you agree or disagree? How can this idea of \"reification\" of algorithms be extended to other paradigms?\n\n*The long version:*\nI am a big fan of Coding Adventures by Sebastian Lague. He just release a new video: <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DxfEbulyFcY>\n\nHe skims over the details (the videos are more edutainment than true in depth education), but a strategy he seems to follow is to look at the top research papers on a subject, take the key equations, and implement those equations as shaders in Unity with HLSL i.e. a C derivative language.\n\nThis is a technique I'm very familiar with. I assume many people here are familiar with it as well. It can be tedious work to do this kind of translation, but it's hugely useful. I find that after doing a translation like that, I often have a much stronger understanding of the concept.\n\nThe way I truly understood integrals and summations was through implementing them as for loops.\n\nI didn't understand monads and combinators until I implemented a parser combinator in an imperative language. In PHP no less. I was young and naive :stuck_out_tongue:.\n\nMany people in this community are fans of functional programming; there have been quite a few threads about ways to encode algorithms more effectively or \"true to their mathematical form:\" everything from APL to natural language to category theory.\n\nThis is a counterpoint against always looking for the \"most efficient way\" to encode an algorithm.\n\nThere is something about taking something \"functional\" and reifying it into a series of imperative steps that helps understanding a concept, at least for my personal learning style.\n\nI have very little experience with visual programming, but things like Factorio (mentioned recently), make me think that reification as learning tool can be just as effective in the visual paradigm. How can this idea of \"reification\" of algorithms be extended to other paradigms, or taken into account more generally?",

I assume many people here are familiar with it as well. It can be tedious work to do this kind of translation, but it's hugely useful. I find that after doing a translation like that, I often have a much stronger understanding of the concept.\n\nThe way I truly understood integrals and summations was through implementing them as for loops.\n\nI didn't understand monads and combinators until I implemented a parser combinator in an imperative language.

While my personal experience agrees with Ray's, I have to conclude after looking around that the phrase \"personal learning style\" is key.\n\nThere's some overlap between this thread and my pet pedagogical approach of learning things bottom up. I found it easier to learn Haskell by ignoring layout rules and infix operators, and explicitly specifying the bounds of each function call."
