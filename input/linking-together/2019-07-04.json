Like when you’re adding two integers you get another integer, which could be just calculated directly, or be stored lazily as a composition of the two original integers wrapped in a structure of the same type (this can be done as a function\/closure or type or class\/object, whatever your preferred implementation flavor is). \n\nOf course, integers are a simplistic example, but many more complex DSLs evaluate to a structure like this. I’ve been recently looking at how SwiftUI works, and it does this with composing transformation operations on views, which are views themselves. I assume React probably works similarly.\n\nIn some object graph libraries for 3D (and 2D as well, for that matter) this is used to apply transformations, for instance to apply a combination of translation, rotation, and skewing operations on an object, which can either be preserved as separate operations (e.g. if you need to visualize each operation in the UI) or can be merged into a single matrix transformation (e.g. if you want faster performance when rendering the object graph).\n\nI believe many functional reactive programming libraries use that pattern to transform and combine streams.\n\nParser combinators are another example, but it’s a little more complicated because they usually use monadic structures to wrap additional state or error handling into the same type.\n\nI’m not sure if I’m using the correct terminology and maybe this is something that’s well known under a different name. It’s just a pattern I see pop up everywhere, especially recently, and which I find extremely interesting, because it allows you to design a system with very few essential building blocks and very high composability — a recipe for building ultra-complex structures from just a few simple components that are easy to learn.",
