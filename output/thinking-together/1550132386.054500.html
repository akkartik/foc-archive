I'm trying to understand how people collaborate, do intellectual work together.<br/>Today programming is very personal, I'm trying to find ways to make it more collaborative, more efficient.<br/><br/>Do you have any examples in mind where people do engineering or intellectual work in collaborative manner?<br/>I'm trying to find examples in real world for inspiration.<br/><br/>As far as I understand, in academia people often divide work to independent parts and each author does his part.<br/>Also authors review the whole thing, correct each other. Pretty much like in today programming (feature branch, code review).<br/><br/>Any other examples of intellectual collaborative work? Collaborative engineering?
