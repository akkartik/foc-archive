<b>Accountability Group for Dev Tools Startup Founders</b><br/><br/>Hello everyone! <br/><br/>Y Combinator is starting a <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/announcing-startup-school-2022">Startup School cohort</a> on Monday, June 27th, and it would be amazing to have a Startup Accountability Group focused on Dev Tools.<br/><br/>If you're also an early founder looking for your first users, raising money or planning to launch your MVP, we'll be meeting weekly to keep each other accountable and share feedback on our progress. We'd love for you to join even if you're not participating in the classes!<br/><br/>Join us by sending me a message or filling this form: <a href="https://forms.gle/TjfKaGs9BYoDTEGx5">https://forms.gle/TjfKaGs9BYoDTEGx5</a><br/><br/>And don't forget to register for Startup School!<br/><br/>And if you want to help organize the group, or you're past the “early founder” phase and want to provide mentorship, please reach out to me!<br/><br/>Thank you!
