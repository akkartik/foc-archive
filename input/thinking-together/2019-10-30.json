            "text": "It is amusing to me that his laptop has an Erlang sticker, when Joe Armstrong, the inventor had such a dim view of the Actor model. There is a lively reunion on YouTube of three famous senior UK computer scientists who each selected a different technology to pursue. One was Hewitt, the actor model, and Armstrong, and Hoare who had some other paradigm i forget which. Anyway they had a debate about what were the results, and Armstrong ripped them to shreds because he pointed out that is system worked and theirs didn't actually work. Pharo has the best IDE i have ever seen, but the underlying language smalltalk was DOA (dead on arrival). The original editions of the smalltalk book by Goldberg are worth a lot, because sensible people like me who bought that book tossed it out because the language is so clunky and hard to read, and frankly absurd. You send the message PLUS to the number 3 along with another operator 2, and then the 3 updates itself to 5. That isn't too far out, but when you get to bitmap manipulation, the model really gets ugly.\n\n The actor model creates not only huge numbers of little islands of state, but then compounds that mistake by creating a message passing system that is hell to debug. In any toolchain that becomes hypercomplex to understand, there are always exceptional people who claim it is no problem, but if you take a big actor model program, and pass it to another programmer, they will have zero chance of understanding it. It becomes a nightmare of dependencies and cross-connections, just like the human body.\n\nI only make these possibly inflammatory remarks to warn people to look up Armstrong's talk, and think twice about wasting your time on a model that has such a legacy of failure.    If someone would like to debate this with me, we can have Steve Krouse act as referee, and hold a fire extinguisher nearby so when you burst into flames you won't be permanently harmed ;-&gt;",

There is a lively reunion on YouTube of three famous senior UK computer scientists who each selected a different technology to pursue. One was Hewitt, the actor model, and Armstrong, and Hoare who had some other paradigm i forget which. Anyway they had a debate about what were the results, and Armstrong ripped them to shreds because he pointed out that is system worked and theirs didn't actually work. Pharo has the best IDE i have ever seen, but the underlying language smalltalk was DOA (dead on arrival). The original editions of the smalltalk book by Goldberg are worth a lot, because sensible people like me who bought that book tossed it out because the language is so clunky and hard to read, and frankly absurd. You send the message PLUS to the number 3 along with another operator 2, and then the 3 updates itself to 5. That isn't too far out, but when you get to bitmap manipulation, the model really gets ugly.\n\n The actor model creates not only huge numbers of little islands of state, but then compounds that mistake by creating a message passing system that is hell to debug. In any toolchain that becomes hypercomplex to understand, there are always exceptional people who claim it is no problem, but if you take a big actor model program, and pass it to another programmer, they will have zero chance of understanding it. It becomes a nightmare of dependencies and cross-connections, just like the human body.\n\nI only make these possibly inflammatory remarks to warn people to look up Armstrong's talk, and think twice about wasting your time on a model that has such a legacy of failure.    If someone would like to debate this with me, we can have Steve Krouse act as referee, and hold a fire extinguisher nearby so when you burst into flames you won't be permanently harmed ;->"

But you know when you're looking outside the process that you'll may get anything. Also you don't usually synchronously look outside your process. You just send a message and are done. Then later, you may get a message related to one you sent."

Applications created with the Croquet software development kit (SDK) can be used to support highly scalable collaborative data visualization, virtual learning and problem solving environments, 3D wikis, online gaming environments (massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs)), and privately maintained or interconnected multiuser virtual environments.\nSince release of the Croquet SDK in 2007, the SDK has not been under active development. All further development of the technology has occurred under the Open Cobalt effort.",

It is their secret weapon and makes AutoCad infinitely programmable. My question remains, what were the technical factors behind the decision to ban Erlang? Plenty of companies use a custom-made secret sauce to generate their products (Facebook uses Hack for front end if i am not mistaken, a derivative of PHP). When you dominate a sector using your tools, why would you ban the tool? Ericsson was kicking butt back in 1998, and still is a top-3 player in Telecom infrastructure equipment. So little information leaks out of companies about why things did or did not pan out. We usually have to wait 20 years or more to find out the true story.",

It is their secret weapon and makes AutoCad infinitely programmable. My question remains, what were the technical factors behind the decision to ban Erlang? Plenty of companies use a custom-made secret sauce to generate their products (Facebook uses Hack for front end if i am not mistaken, a derivative of PHP). When you dominate a sector using your tools, why would you ban the tool? Ericsson was kicking butt back in 1998, and still is a top-3 player in Telecom infrastructure equipment. So little information leaks out of companies about why things did or did not pan out. We usually have to wait 20 years or more to find out the true story."
