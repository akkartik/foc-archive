Hi, I’m Rob Haisfield. I’m a behavioral product strategy and gamification consultant, as well as a behavioral product strategist at <a href="https://www.sparkwave.tech/">Spark Wave</a>. Basically that means that I think about how to influence user behavior such that people gain more value out of the apps that they use.<br/><br/>I’m largely in this group due to my work on the onboarding for GuidedTrack, a domain-specific language for interconnected form building --&gt; web applications. Since working with them, I’ve become fascinated with powerful horizontal products with a smooth learning curve from beginner to power user, and domain-specific languages feel like the next natural step. There’s a lot that could be done to make DSLs learnable, even as replacements for full-blown apps, and I want to help make that happen!<br/><br/>You can find some of my work for GuidedTrack here:<br/><br/><a href="https://robhaisfield.com/notes/guidedtrack">https://robhaisfield.com/notes/guidedtrack</a><br/><br/>And if you want to skip ahead a bit for the full onboarding plan I presented them: <a href="https://robhaisfield.com/notes/onboarding-plan-as-presented-to-guidedtrack-on-10-20-20">https://robhaisfield.com/notes/onboarding-plan-as-presented-&hellip;</a>
