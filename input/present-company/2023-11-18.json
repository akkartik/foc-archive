Don't get me wrong, I think most traditional textual code could be laid out and formatted much better too, but _in general_ I find it easier to scan and understand the top-down flow of textual code than nodes.\n\nMaybe I just haven't seen the right tools which do this better? Or maybe I'm in a tiny minority? What do folks here think? (And please forgive me if this conversation has been done to death in this Slack already, I've not seen it.)",
