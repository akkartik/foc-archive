Since the pages are then considered to be source code by Pharo tools, you get version control (via Iceberg, Pharo's git interface) for free. Much of the GToolkit documentation is actually written this way, so just get GToolkit and look at the tutorials to see how this works in practice.\n\nI have been playing with *computational* wikis in Pharo\/GToolkit recently (see <https:\/\/github.com\/activepapers\/activepapers-pharo> for the details). That took some extra code because I wanted groups of Wiki pages with a shared code basis. One Pharo class is then a package of code, data, and Wiki pages.",

The writeup [<https:\/\/www.cgal.org\/exact.html>] is a better articulation of my pain that I've yet been able to put together myself.\n\nI don't think their escape hatch (arbitrary precision) is appropriate for my needs — I need to set tight execution time limits, and if I'm going to be cutting things off I might as well just use well-chosen finite numeric representations at all times.\n\nBut I so love that they've approached the problem with this perspective:\n\n&gt; The second and deeper problem is that numerical weapons are per se less effective in geometric computing than they are in other fields. In geometry, we don't compute numbers but structures: convex hulls, triangulations, etc. In building these structures, the underlying algorithms ask questions like \"is a point to the left, to the right, or on the line through two other points?\" Such questions have no answers that are \"slightly off\". Either you get it right, or you don't. And if you don't, the algorithm might go completely astray. Even the most fancy roundoff control techniques don't help here: it's primarily a combinatorial problem, not a numerical one.\n\n&gt; We concentrate on the geometry (after all, that's what we do best), and the CGAL algorithms themselves don't contain any numerical security measures to keep them from going astray.\n\nThat's perfect. And I think I can do just as well by restricting my domain to things that are simple, cleanly representable, and closed-form. Fingers crossed!",

In geometry, we don't compute numbers but structures: convex hulls, triangulations, etc. In building these structures, the underlying algorithms ask questions like \"is a point to the left, to the right, or on the line through two other points?\" Such questions have no answers that are \"slightly off\". Either you get it right, or you don't. And if you don't, the algorithm might go completely astray. Even the most fancy roundoff control techniques don't help here: it's primarily a combinatorial problem, not a numerical one."
