<a href="https://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-frameworks/">https://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-frameworks/</a><br/><br/>A good comparison can be Qt vs Skia.<br/><br/>I agree with most claims of this essay. However, having used many frameworks and after having analyzed why they work well, it boils down to.<br/><br/>1. Good documentation<br/>2. Multiplatform abstraction behind a standard interface<br/>3.  Combine many calls into a simple end point (button->draw in Qt vs drawing a button via Skia)<br/>If these are addressed by libraries, then libraries with simple callbacks are much more preferrable to frameworks.<br/><br/>One problem which frameworks and libraries don't address or hide away is state machines.<br/>An app is fundamentally event loop + state machine.<br/><br/>Any framework that you use long enough, you will want to peek into how it is actually handling events and customize it.

I think frameworks can change the programming model whereas a library cannot.<br/><br/>So a runtime like Akka is really a framework (note also has a state machine abstraction) , but there is no real way you can add the actor model without giving up execution control. Similarly, React gave a declarative programming model to the imperative DOM.  Not sure if its possible as a library (it kinda of is a library until you hit the JSX bit)<br/><br/>Programming languages don't compose either. I see frameworks as a less drastic version of a language change. They can fundamentally change the whole programming model. They change a programming language into a different programming language, but without changing the syntax (React did change the syntax too tho) or access to the ecosystem libraries.<br/><br/>So sometimes a thing needs to be a framework, but you should use the least powerful thing to achieve your needs. If it can be done as a library then do it as a library.
