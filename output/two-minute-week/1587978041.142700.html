I just want to take a moment and say â€” this channel is making me incredibly happy. I have been absolutely delighted by every one of these videos, and I'm feeling so inspired by all the work you're doing. There are already a lot of fascinating ideas on display here, and the two minute format is so digestible that it's cracking an accessibility barrier that's kept me from properly appreciating many of them before. Thank you for making these videos and fostering the discussions, and I hope we'll be able to keep the momentum going.
