On explainability of statistical methods (and their applicability to the FoC, perhaps). "AI" explainability is somewhat hot right now as we've realized that it's hard to make systems these work reliably (and trust their output) if we don't really understand why and how they do what they do. On a larger scale, better explainability could lead to faster iteration, better models and more widespread adoption in areas where uncertainty calibrated output is important.<br/><br/>I'm definitely not an expert and mostly focused on NLP, where the majority of research output is measured against various accuracy-based benchmarks with less investigation into the why's &amp; potential biases (though there's some interesting progress like <a href="https://github.com/marcotcr/checklist">CheckList</a>).<br/><br/>• Do any of you have experiences with getting explanations out of statistical systems? <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jack Rusher</span>? <br/>• Taking a larger view, any thoughts on how AI might help the Future of Coding (thinking of Codota, Kite, etc.)?

It's a deep topic that I don't have time to type about very much atm, but the two lines of inquiry that have worked best for me have been:<br/>• Training systems to align labels with other things in a shared latent space. In an art context, that can show itself as a model that can caption images also being able to direct a GAN to generate images based on a caption, as I did here: <a href="https://twitter.com/jackrusher/status/1356902381880025089">https://twitter.com/jackrusher/status/1356902381880025089</a><br/>• Models that generate computer programs representing their decision process, which gives more of the kind of procedural representation that is sometimes required. (No link because I haven't published any of this stuff).<br/>In the "AI" + FoC space, I'm probably most excited by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06640">things like this</a>, which can lead to more human-friendly coding assistants.

I was thinking of this quote earlier today, "[F]or most of us, even a simple image manipulation in Photoshop presents insurmountable difﬁculties… any less-than-perfect edit immediately makes the image look completely unrealistic. To put another way, classic visual manipulation paradigm does not prevent the user from “falling off” the manifold of natural images." <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/aia/">https://distill.pub/2017/aia/</a><br/><br/>I like this idea of a network refolding a domain so that movements in the possibility space lead you to domain-level objects rather than nonsense.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jack Rusher</span> The Forth paper is awesome, thanks for the link. Decomposing the rather general problem of a universal language model into more tractable subcomponents (e.g. one for basic maths/logic &amp; one for general language as in the paper) makes a lot of sense to me. Models that can retrieve facts from knowledge bases are another good use case. Does anyone know of more work in this area?<br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@William Taysom</span> That's a great example, love the GAN examples. There are quite a few cases like this where the "action space" is far larger than usually necessary, leading to quite complicated tools with myriads of e.g. configuration options that only make sense in specific combinations. Imagine code editing assisted by a program like that, or just general text editing..

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Lucian Ursu</span> It's easier if the language has little syntax and can be serialized into a stream of tokens. FORTH is my current favorite for this purpose.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Lucian Ursu</span> well, you <em>can</em> serialize anything into tokens, but the more complicated the notation the more rules your network needs to learn to encode it.

forth has the delicious property of being trivially serializable into tokens because you can read each token as a function that takes a stack and returns a stack, and space as both the token separator and the function composition operator. so you can split a forth program anywhere and replace n tokens with a word in a lookup table that returns the original string of tokens and get the same result (i’m sure there are edge cases, but it’s pretty universal)
