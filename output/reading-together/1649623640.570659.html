Also started reading through “Usability Analysis of Visual Programming Environments: a ‘cognitive dimensions’ framework” by Green and Petre (1996).<br/><br/>&gt; The dimensions in outline: The list of dimensions that we shall use in this paper follows. For each dimension we supply a thumb-nail description. A lengthier account of the dimension and its relation to the underlying evidence will be found in the appropriate section below.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; • <b>Abstraction Gradient</b>: What are the minimum and maximum levels of abstraction? Can fragments be encapsulated?<br/>&gt; • <b>Closeness of mapping</b>: What ‘programming games’ need to be learned?<br/>&gt; • <b>Consistency</b>: When some of the language has been learnt, how much of the rest can be inferred?<br/>&gt; • <b>Diffuseness</b>: How many symbols or graphic entities are required to express a meaning?<br/>&gt; • <b>Error-proneness</b>: Does the design of the notation induce ‘careless mistakes’?<br/>&gt; • <b>Hard mental operations</b>: Are there places where the user needs to resort to fingers or pen- cilled annotation to keep track of what’s happening?<br/>&gt; • <b>Hidden dependencies</b>: Is every dependency overtly indicated in both directions? Is the indi- cation perceptual or only symbolic?<br/>&gt; • <b>Premature commitment</b>: Do programmers have to make decisions before they have the information they need?<br/>&gt; • <b>Progressive evaluation</b>: Can a partially-complete program be executed to obtain feedback on “How am I doing”?<br/>&gt; • <b>Role-expressiveness</b>: Can the reader see how each component of a program relates to the whole?<br/>&gt; • <b>Secondary notation</b>: Can programmers use layout, colour, or other cues to convey extra meaning, above and beyond the ‘official’ semantics of the language?<br/>&gt; • <b>Viscosity</b>: How much effort is required to perform a single change?<br/>&gt; • <b>Visibility</b>: Is every part of the code simultaneously visible (assuming a large enough display), or is it at least possible to juxtapose any two parts side-by-side at will? If the code is dispersed, is it at least possible to know in what order to read it?<br/><a href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/CS589and584/CS589-papers/CogDimsPaper.pdf">https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/CS589and584/CS589-&hellip;</a>
