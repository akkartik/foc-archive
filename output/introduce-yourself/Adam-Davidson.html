Hello! I’m Adam Davidson.  I was introduced to the podcast by a friend recently and love it! I’ve only listened to a few of the episodes so far and have really loved the topics they choose and generally the zoomed out perspective of programming they tend to take.  I already feel like I have learned a lot and found some people who like to think about the same sorts of things that I do.<br/><br/>I am a software engineer without a particular focus since my interest seems to take me in a different direction every month.  a recurring interest is the intersection of computation with music and art.<br/><br/><a href="https://adam26davidson.github.io/harmony-visualizer/">Here is a website I made back in 2018 that let’s you visua&hellip;</a> (please forgive the design / font choice I was in college :joy:)<br/><br/>oops hit enter before finishing…<br/><br/>I majored in math in college and got terrible grades as I had undiagnosed ADD and was more interested in making music and silly websites (but somehow made it through).<br/><br/>I grew up in Japan and speak Japanese but cannot read Kanji above grade 4 level (there are too many)<br/><br/>some recent projects I have been working on:<br/>• Hardware x software project to create little audio  / midi processing modules that snap together with magnetic connectors and are configurable in a browser with a max msp style editor. So far I have a working PCB designed in keyCAD and have rewritten the code 4 times (!) from arduinoIDE C++ > platformio with C++ > stmCubeIDE with C > embedded rust <br/>• Music theory based chord progression improvisation instrument using a ps4 controller connected to a raspberry pi with small display attached, and a codebase and UI i (stupidly) built with python and TKInter (!)<br/>• For work I do semi - boring azure cloud development in C# and Java (although I have come to LOVE these languages)<br/>I am very excited to explore what people are up to here and (crap I hit enter again pfffaaaaaeifuveurv) learning together!
