So excited to meet everyone here! I'm John, the founder and creator of the Primitive <em>Immersive Development Environment</em>. I started Primitive in 2015 because I wanted to create the IDE of the future. I believe the future of programming is collaborative, immersive, and powered by spatial computing and artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>The Primitive IDE is my life's work. It is a collaborative 3D/VR environment where users explore codebases to learn, review, and debug code in an unlimited environment. A few things that makes Primitive unique:<br/>• Primitive crawls GitHub and has a fully explorable mapping of the top repositories<br/>• Anybody can view their own code on their local machine and see a directory and file mapping in a 3D spatial layout<br/>• Programming files are parsed by a variety of tools (ANTLR, Roslyn, Clang, JavaC) to show their AST structure and to enable animated reference maps in the 3D space<br/>• For Java, Primitive can display multi-thread runtime traces and a memory graph in the 3D environment<br/>• There is also a backend that integrates with Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab and automatically analyzes your private repos to share with your team. This is great for code walkthroughs and onboarding<br/>• The backend does AST diffing in git, and will show you changes in the codebase as a 3D model. This is amazing for code review, because it's very easy to see what has changed in a PR<br/>• Finally, and most experimentally, we have a voice-controlled Codex implementation. This is the future that I'm most excited about: a team of people asking a machine to generate code, that gets displayed and tested in a 3D VR environment. Here is a demo: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icHLoxOFerk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icHLoxOFerk</a><br/>I'm glad to have discussions about spatial computing and AI enabled programming. I just discovered this community and I'm excited to hear about what everyone is working on.<br/><br/><a href="https://primitive.io/">https://primitive.io/</a><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/PrimitiveVR">https://twitter.com/PrimitiveVR</a>
