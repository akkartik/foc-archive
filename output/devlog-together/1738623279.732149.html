working towards programatic bulk export of observable notebooks into the lopefile format. Currently Observable has the concept of an import, but its a static macro type of thing, so there is no way of scripting it.  I need to script it to be able to take any notebook and shove it into a standard website frame, that then becomes a single static file you can move around as a single HTML file artefact. Anyway, some progress towards that with a <a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/import-notebook">programmatic import</a>. The import merges the notebooks in such a way as a subsequent export includes the import as a statically baked in dependancy. So it becomes offline-first at that point.
