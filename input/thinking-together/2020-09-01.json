I’m wondering how a regular, non-programmer would organize information with only the barest of tools. Would some spatial\/relationship based thing come out of it?\nIf you know anyone in high school or college who isn’t studying CS, try looking at their personal notebooks or journals.\n\nI think people often store information in narrative form. The narrative gives many contact points with the same piece of information.\n\nA particularly adept learner might write about what they learned in many ways: how it applies to their life, where they have seen it in the world, the strict technical definitions, and some metaphors that capture the essence of the subject.\n\nWe want to look at the same information in as many ways as possible so we can get an intuitive sense for it. Something that we understand deeply can represent itself as a felt-sense in the body, as opposed to an intellectual thought, like a grandmaster chess player analyzing his position on the board, or a tennis player analyzing the trajectory of a ball.",
