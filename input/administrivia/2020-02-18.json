This is a very difficult, divisive topic, and I truly appreciate everyone sharing their concerns and questions and suggestions.\n\n<@UJ6LDMMN0>\n&gt; I have a question: have we as a community already been in situations where a CoC would have been needed?\nAs others have said, a CoC is a sign that this community has principles — including taking a strong stand against harassment and hate speech — and we are willing to defend them. People have directly told us that they haven't joined because of the lack of a CoC. I want those people to join and feel good here!\n\nThere's an emerging trend of startups using our community _only_ to promote themselves. I want to establish the norm that someone sharing their own work is highly encouraged, but they should also participate in discussions, share interesting links, offer feedback on others' work, or otherwise use the community as more than a vehicle for self-promotion. If I do a search for someone's posts and pretty much all of them mention their startup, I will (and have) DM them and ask them to talk about other things too.\n\nThere have been some exchanges deep in threads that have toed up to the line of needing moderator intervention, but nothing yet that would have resulted in a punitive response, as far as I'm aware. There was an account created with an overtly inappropriate name that resulted in an insta-ban. There's always the possibility that someone has been harassed via DM, but again no actual instances that I'm aware of. These sorts of things are increasingly likely to happen as our community grows, so it's worth being ready.\n\n<@U6KQ2S410>\n&gt; Thought experiment: would Curtis Yarvin be welcome here? He has been ostracized from many communities for (supposedly) racist statements made in unrelated places in the past. Is behavior outside the community restricted by the CoC?\nThat's an excellent point.\n\nWould Curtis Yarvin be welcome here — no, absolutely not.\n\nIs behaviour outside the community considered in light of the CoC when deciding whether someone should be allowed to join? Yes, in ways that should be explicitly bounded and stated.\n\nI don't want someone thinking that if they make a dirty joke on twitter or write a blog post saying a bunch of nasty things about Trump or Warren that they'll be banned from the community. But I think it's reasonable to make a strong statement specifically against hate and harassment even if it happens outside the community. If someone's twitter is full of racist or sexist posts, that's across the line — they've decided to publicly signal that they disrespect people in our community.\n\nAs another example, let's look at Brendan Eich. I _think_ we should allow him to join if he wants, but I'm open to being persuaded. I think someone's hurtful actions in the past should be judged based on the severity of those actions and how they've acted since. Someone's hurtful actions in private should be judged based on the severity of those actions and how they handle them coming to light. I think it's important to allow people to grow, and for us to recognize and reward that growth. But I think it's vastly more important to pay attention to the people who have been or could be hurt and support them.\n\nI will work on expanding and clarifying the CoC accordingly.",

Yes, in ways that should be explicitly bounded and stated.\n\nI don't want someone thinking that if they make a dirty joke on twitter or write a blog post saying a bunch of nasty things about Trump or Warren that they'll be banned from the community. But I think it's reasonable to make a strong statement specifically against hate and harassment even if it happens outside the community. If someone's twitter is full of racist or sexist posts, that's across the line — they've decided to publicly signal that they disrespect people in our community.\n\nAs another example, let's look at Brendan Eich.

For instance — if Chris Granger were to do another startup, I wouldn't want there to be a guideline that'd discourage him from posting. He's always been great about sharing the ideas behind his work and relating them to the field, in a way that is valuable to the reader. But that sharing necessarily takes the form of \"Here's what we're doing with Eve\", which is absolutely a form of company promotion — it's just that it adds value to the community rather than extracting value from it."
