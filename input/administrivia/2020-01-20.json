Can you expand on this point a bit?\n\n&gt; if FoC is a platform to help push your own ideas\nThat's a goal for me only insofar as this community should be a platform to promote everyone's work. I want the \"rising tide lifts all boats\" outcome.\n\n&gt; why not continue to do it for free, and treat it as a labor of love\nI'll happily do the Slack community management stuff indefinitely, patreon or not, since the effort cost is reasonable and I value this community a lot and want it to continue to grow and thrive.\n\nI think the podcast medium has a good balance between what supporters are willing to pay for (patreons and sponsorships), and what you have to subject your audience to in order to earn that payment (brief plugs and sponsor reads) — far healthier balance than ads on the web, on TV, amazon referral links, tracking cookies, etc. So I think that the podcast will be perfectly sustainable on a small scale, even with my eventual goal of making it feel very professional. I love the podcast medium with a tremendous passion, and it's a great complement to all the other audio\/video work I do as a job and hobby, and I most certainly don't want it to become something I try to milk for a 100x ROI. I just want to make good episodes, interviewing interesting people that our community will appreciate and enjoy listening to.\n\nIf you have an interest in podcasting yourself.. have you thought about starting up a podcast of your own? If you did something that was relevant, you'd have an audience here in this community that'd surely take an interest and give you early feedback.",

I love the podcast medium with a tremendous passion, and it's a great complement to all the other audio\/video work I do as a job and hobby, and I most certainly don't want it to become something I try to milk for a 100x ROI. I just want to make good episodes, interviewing interesting people that our community will appreciate and enjoy listening to.\n\nIf you have an interest in podcasting yourself.. have you thought about starting up a podcast of your own? If you did something that was relevant, you'd have an audience here in this community that'd surely take an interest and give you early feedback."
