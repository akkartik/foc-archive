Technically, any code is full of abstraction: any name is a stand-in for something more complex elsewhere. But at that (e.g. symbolic abstraction) level the whole program is an abstraction. So it's hard to have any meaningful discussion about abstraction, unless you cut that level out as a given and assume that we're taking about the model (of data and/or behavior).<br/><br/>But like Kartik says, it's difficult to have meaningful discussion at all about something that people use in so many different ways. It's the same thing with TDD, architecture, abstraction, etc.<br/><br/>I suppose we cannot disagree about clarification needed per context!
