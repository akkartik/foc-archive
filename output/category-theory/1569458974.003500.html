&gt; This is known as the Yoneda lemma for preorders. The if and only if condition proved in part 3 implies that, up to equivalence, to know an element is the same as knowing its upper set—that is, knowing its web of relationships with the other elements of the preorder.<br/><br/>It's all about formalizing the "web of relationships."  The ↑ summarizes the relationship of an element to the others, and ⊆ gives you the web so that you can recover the element from the summaries.<br/><br/>&gt; The general Yoneda lemma is a powerful tool in category theory, and a fascinating philosophical idea besides.<br/><br/>It's a bit like the Database Reconstruction Theorem &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT19VwBAqKA&gt;: if you know all the statistics, you can recover the underlying data.<br/><br/>&gt; In the directions for reading the book they say you skip the ends of the chapters and still be able to gain something from the next chapter but I'll go back and work on those sections you recommend.<br/><br/>Do.  I really think their use of preorders for the first chapter was inspired.
