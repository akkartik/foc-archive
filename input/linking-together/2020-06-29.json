The parallela computer by Andreas Olaffson made it to 4000 nodes, and it worked, but they didn’t have a programming language to handle 4000 independent CPUs so nobody could program the damn chip. Although this is our present universe having many Cores, there is no easy to use programming language that facilitates programming these modules.\n\nSo people will start out with some simple idea for a game and then it will be flaky. Debugging multi-threaded code is well known to be a hard thing and this is even harder than multithreading because you have completely independent chips. This is what makes aerospace and automotive software the most difficult of all types. One could argue in the case of automotive that you would be better off having a single processing system with a redundant backup rather than having so many independent computers. Supposedly it’s for reliability to have each independent module have its own processing power but actually in the JPL missions they couldn’t waste the power of having so many independent systems so they would put in an odd number of brains and have them vote on the outcome, and any system voting wrong too much just gets turned off. Anyway programming 30 independent nodes it is not 30 times harder than a single Node but more like 9000 times harder. I have no doubt that someone is going to figure out how to make parallel computing easily, but it will take an Alan Turing level of mathematics genius to do it. I have seen parallel computing fail for 50 years. From the illiac IV or whatever it was called.  Many attempts from many different companies, there is no more certain graveyard than parallel computing. Who knows maybe this toy could spark a breakthrough. There was a guy who as a child went on a trip to the island of Crete, and they had at the gift shop plastic models of the Phaistos disk which is an undecoded script and he was able to figure it out later on in his life. This is the same guy that decoded Rongo Rongo writing from the Easter island, which turns upside down each line. Some people have a knack for doing puzzles that defy all other attempts to solve, I think we should have some kind of prize offered for solving the parallel computing language issue.\n\nThere is a language called parasail which succeeds it allowing some things to be automatically be parallelized, via loops and there is a kind of super Fortran called chapel that facilitates giant computational clusters for Cray, but nobody has conquered the problem of debugging massively parallel code easily.
