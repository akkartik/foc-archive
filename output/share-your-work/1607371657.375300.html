Hey all, this time we are going to brag a little bit :D: after having good success on reddit, we decided to try putting <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/wasp-lang-alpha">Wasp (Alpha) on Product Hunt</a> and we managed to end up on the first place yesterday!!<br/>After pushing hard on development during the summer, we are now again balancing between developing the compiler/language and on the other hand building a community, getting first testers, contributors, so getting some exposure on Product Hunt helps with this.<br/>We are done with "launching" Alpha for now, but we do plan to continue reaching out to people by writing hopefully relevant/valuable blog posts.
