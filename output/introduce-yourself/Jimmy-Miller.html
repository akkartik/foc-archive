I don’t think I ever actually introduced myself. I’m sure most of you have seen me around on some thread or other, but figured I should probably do this officially.<br/><br/>If you listened to the latest episode, you will know me as a new cohost on the podcast. Super excited to join <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> in getting to think through some ideas, read some old papers, talk about interesting concepts in the “future of coding”.<br/><br/>But a bit about me. I do clojure for my day job, but have been loving rust lately. I love public speaking. I’ve got two talks on the youtubes about programming. One about a library a friend of mine made in clojure around term rewriting (the talk itself is pretty future of coding adjacent, if we crank that future to the nearer term). But also a talk about how philosophy of science relates to programming (Specifically are programming paradigms kuhnian paradigms).<br/><br/>As for my views on future of coding things, I’m not really a partisan. I think the most exciting thing about the work we all do here is the breadth, the explorations, the diversity of views. I have my opinions of course. But I think the future of coding has to include lots of views, many of which aren’t for me.<br/><br/>For my non-programming hobby, I love analytic philosophy. It is like the best parts of programming, but can be done in the armchair. Analytic philosophy is also very tied up in the history of computer science. The deeper you dive, the more similarities you find.<br/><br/>Finally, since we are going to be reading a lot on the podcast, I plan on posting on #reading-together regularly about the papers we are reading and others (will post there later today about todays episode). I hope this can serve as a nice place to have conversations about the episodes and to help pick paper to talk about on future shows.
