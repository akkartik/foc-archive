:satellite_antenna: I had the pleasure of guest-hosting the most recent episode of the Future of Coding podcast — an interview with Berlin-based Lisp programmer Jack Rusher. I invite you to listen here [<a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/041">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/041</a>] or in your podcast player of choice.<br/><br/>Topics: Scheme and Racket and Clojure (oh my), the minimalist but powerful literate editor <a href="https://maria.cloud">https://maria.cloud</a>, practical lessons about presentation and <em>feel</em> that programming tool authors can learn from video games and creative coders (like Devine Lu Linvega), a bit about typing disciplines and model checking, graphic design principles, visual programming, and some of our favourite papers.<br/><br/>Enjoy, do let me know what you think. This is my first time (ever) making a podcast, so I'm sure I've still got a lot to learn.

this was my favorite episode yet and I really appreciated both how wide-ranging it was and how well-documented the links were in the podcast description

This was great. I honestly don't listen to the podcast much, just because I've somehow never made a habit of listening to anything. But this episode got me over the hump to listen to it, since it was about Lisp. And I was so glad I got to it, because it brought up an idea for my current project that has nothing to do with Lisp.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about a "personal data server" as the first use case for my "human-size computer", and the notion of "complex event processing" (applying FRP to an incoming stream of data) shows me how some of the other projects here connect up concretely with my somewhat <em>outre</em> endeavor.<br/><br/>Creating serendipitous connections between our various projects is the highest aim of this group, I think. This episode achieved that at least for me.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Garth Goldwater</span> I’m glad someone appreciated the links! That (plus editing the transcript) took about 10x the time I thought they would. But totally worth it.
