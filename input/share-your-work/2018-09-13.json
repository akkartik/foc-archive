Maybe I should have watched the earlier demos, but I was missing an initial motivation (mostly which problems you want to solve and a general description of your idea\/approach). The stuff you showed is really cool, but from the demo I don't know how that could be useful for me. The visualization of messages being sent between nodes is neat. I think that for demos you could slow that down even more so that it's easier to understand what's going on. And yep, I'd watch another demo :wink:",
