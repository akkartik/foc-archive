<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Rik Hemsley</span> as you can see, many have looked into AST and structural treatments of programs.  A standard may be tricky because an AST can really represent different amounts of structure.  Consider a basic syntax tree (this expression joins with that one) vs a binding tree (where scope of variables is also represented).  In my experience (say with Lisp and Scheme macros), it's the binding tree that you need to have in mind for any non-trivial structural interaction.
