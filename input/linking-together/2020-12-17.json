When academic research is done well, deep work is essential, and being a full-time scientist is (although that’s dying now too with increased demands) one of the few places where success isn’t possible WITHOUT this type of deep focus and concentration. Especially for non-experimental fields like math and computer science. Cal Newport, author of Deep Work and a theory professor himself, talks about this allll the time on his blog and his podcast.\n\nThe way I see it, new knowledge is the ‘goal’ of academic research. Deep thoughts &amp; deep work are what’s necessary to produce said new knowledge. Really getting to the bottom of things, understanding why X doesn’t work but Y could work, and chasing those ideas *for the sake of them*. The author probably hasn’t interacted with many FoC people :slightly_smiling_face: so they default to the place \/ arena they know well (academic research)",

When academic research is done well, deep work is essential, and being a full-time scientist is (although that’s dying now too with increased demands) one of the few places where success isn’t possible WITHOUT this type of deep focus and concentration. Especially for non-experimental fields like math and computer science. Cal Newport, author of Deep Work and a theory professor himself, talks about this allll the time on his blog and his podcast.\n\nThe way I see it, new knowledge is the ‘goal’ of academic research. Deep thoughts & deep work are what’s necessary to produce said new knowledge. Really getting to the bottom of things, understanding why X doesn’t work but Y could work, and chasing those ideas "
