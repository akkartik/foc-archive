If some language has a built-in function called flurb(), you can always just create a runtime function that does that function on the other language. But structural issues, name scoping, and tricky closures and nesting of symbols can be hard to remap between languages. As a long time user of Modula-2 i could convert M2 to many other languages very easily because it is actually very simple. Always easier to map from a simple language into a more complex one (like Swift for example), but a nightmare to go from a complex one like Swift into say Pascal or Python.
