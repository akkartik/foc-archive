I'm slowly convincing myself that the future of programming includes <b>verbalizability</b> (and thus, natural language).<br/><br/>The <b>ubiquity</b> and <b>utility</b> of natural language is well known: almost all of the information we read, write/type, speak and hear every day is communicated via a natural language, not a specially-crafted one. Natural language is our primary means of understanding the world and interacting with other humans, especially in the absence of supplementary tools such as pen-and-paper (e.g. in face-to-face conversation). When was the last time you described a cause-and-effect phenomenon (a story, event, or task instructions) to someone without extensive use of natural language? At best, we use other artifacts (diagrams, formal models) as aids.<br/><br/>Despite the ubiquity and utility of natural language, if one person tries to "speak" a Java/C/JS/Rust program to another person, they have to go through an extremely complicated and lossy translation process from <b>code</b> to <b>words</b>. Based on some of my recent design work (not shared yet), I'm beginning to believe we could actually design programming languages whose "source code" consists <b>solely</b> of <b>terse</b> natural language sentences/structures with <b>very specific</b> syntax restrictions (to deny multiple interpretations / ambiguities). The language would not be accompanied by any supplementary symbols (!@#$%^&amp;]/-&gt;) with domain-specific meaning, since those would inhibit verbalization. Writing code in this language still requires careful deliberation (to develop the logic), but <em>reading</em> and <em>discussing</em> code with full verbalization becomes trivial: no translation is required at all!<br/><br/>Yes, I'm not the first person to think about putting natural language in PLs. Someone might bring up COBOL, HyperTalk, SQL, or similar. I'm not saying verbalizability is "the solution" to programming alone, but along with a well-crafted semantics (information model etc.), it could lead to something extraordinary.<br/><br/>If anyone wants to think further about this, Felienne Hermans <a href="https://youtu.be/CgR5mSAGxtA?t=2663">discusses verbalization/vocalization of PLs as part of a larger talk</a> (video is timestamped to that bit). Quote: "how does code sound?"<br/><br/>I searched this Slack's <a href="http://history.futureofcoding.org/">archives</a>, and I was surprised to discover the word "verbalization" has never been used.

Our latest work on a front-end revolves pretty much entirely around this idea. :slightly_smiling_face: The big shift for us came from moving our focus away from “simple” to “simple to understand.” The results have been encouraging so far. Here’s the obligatory “incrementer button”<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">an incrementer is a button with a count of 0<br/>    the text is bound to its count<br/><br/>when an incrementer is clicked<br/>    increment the count</pre><br/>None of that is builtin, e.g. here’s how increment is defined:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">to increment a number<br/>    set the number to the number + 1</pre><br/>And here’s a button:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">a button is an element that has a text string<br/>    its tag is "button"<br/>    always set "textContent" of the button to its text</pre>

Verbalizability (I'm going to go with pronounceability) is an entirely different prospect from natural language. Pronounceability is definitely a great thing, for accessibility if nothing else. I still can't imagine a system of "terse natural language sentences" that isn't hostile to at least one of precision or concision. I'd love to be convinced otherwise. Can you give a napkin-example of what you have in mind?<br/><br/>For pronounceability I would still follow the lead of mathematics as pronounced, e.g. "f of x equals forall y in d g of x and y". Whatever approach you take needs to have enough expressive power to balance out the bandwidth limit of at least speech, if not word-based notation (I like the idea of a conventional-looking system with operators that happen to all have reasonable pronunciations, which would keep the written syntax relatively compact).<br/><br/>OTOH: if you can just avoid the trap of phrases that look like multiple words but parse like a single token (in that they always have to be together in the same order), if you just let words be independently composable, you'll be head and shoulders above COBOL et al.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andrew F</span> The only reason I'd say "verbalize" rather than "pronounce" is that the latter usually refers to individual words, whereas the former can refer to <b>whole systems</b>. I want readers to be able to verbalize an entire system, as if they were hearing a (detailed, accurate) description from a friend.<br/><br/>Regarding "following the lead of mathematics", my language is going to be extraordinarily light on <b>functions</b> (if I can get away with it), and thus on mathematical notation. Code re-use occurs through via interrelated rules that observe and produce abstracted data through pattern-matching. These act like polymorphic functions, so for most computations there is nothing to "call" and no need for mathematical primitives, no "f(x)". We can still retain that classical syntax for mathematical (numeric) expressions, though.<br/><br/>Regarding "multiple words that parse like a token", that shouldn't be a problem, because programs will be built through structured editing (AST etc) with appropriate autocomplete and syntax highlighting.<br/><br/>I'll see if I can come up with a napkin example that I can actually defend! I'm still working on the semantics of my system, and I'm worried that an example wouldn't make sense to anyone else yet.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Granger</span> Yeah I think that a "simple model" and an "easy to read language" (in terms of Rich Hickey's definitions of "simple" and "easy") are both crucial. I've also been focusing too narrow-mindedly on the former.<br/><br/>Your code example demonstrates not just a <b>language</b>, but obviously an <b>information model</b> and a <b>time model</b> as well. I like the readability of the language, but now you've got me curious about the underlying models. :thinking_face:

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Granger</span> Also, it looks like your prototype is building on HTML? The thought scares me tbh. It looks like it could warp the design of your information and time models. Your language semantics become tied to HTML/CSS semantics.

It's interesting to compare operator-heavy languages like Haskell with math notation. The latter has always been a shorthand notation for a highly codified jargon. It is pronounceable because mathematicians have communicated orally all the time. Occasional excesses into unpronounceable notations have been made, but never made it into mainstream. This mechanism hasn't worked for digital notations because people  don't communicate about them orally.<br/><br/>A cultural practice of the Lisp community (in the widest sense, including Scheme etc.) that I have always appreciated is to value pronounceability of names. Which may seem surprising to all those who never take a closer look at Lisp because of all those parentheses. For me, Lisps are the PLs closest to natural language (but I have never used Cobol), and that's their strong point.

To buttress your point <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span> I miss being able to name variables ‘open?’ . This is an interesting example actually because when said out loud it is the same word as ‘open’ but with a different tone or maybe ‘open?’ should be pronounced ‘is open’ . <br/><br/>Is that a strike against using variable names like this :thinking_face:.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ope</span> Indeed, the question mark was one of the main innovations coming from Scheme. Once you have seen it, you can't help but consider the <tt>-p</tt> prefix from earlier Lisp days incredibly clumsy. I read the question mark with a different tone (to myself, I hardly speak Lisp to others), and that sounds very natural to me.

When trying to use natural language as a basis for programming, I suppose a lot of effort needs to go into dealing with ambiguity.<br/><br/>I'm all for this, because I think problems with complexity and with understandability come from the level of precision that is required to do programming today, which caters to logic and math types, and is far beyond what non-programmers are used to from their daily lives.<br/><br/>I wonder, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Granger</span>, can you talk more about how you explicitly deal with ambiguities in that prototype, or is that not a concern at all?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nick Smith</span> Nothing is builtin, so drawing to HTML in this instance has no implications on the semantics of the language itself. You could just as easily replace the definition of element with something that draws to GL. This is all you need for the def of element:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">an element is a thing with a tag "div"<br/><br/>to create an element<br/>    dom.elem(the element, its tag)</pre><br/>It’s just an FFI call. The language was designed to be able to go all the way down to bare metal if desired.<br/><br/>The full semantics of the model is probably best left for another discussion :slightly_smiling_face:

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> we spent a bunch of time trying to understand what ambiguity really is and where it comes up in previous work on doing sophisticated natural language querying. In the end we realized that as long as you’re not writing full prose (e.g. limiting yourself to individual sentences rather than full paragraphs) the only form of ambiguity you really have to deal with is the edges between nodes in the sentence. For example, which object’s count does “the count” refer to? There are lots of simple heuristics we employ as humans to resolve that and in the end the only thing you really need to provide is a way to correct the edge if it’s wrong. In past projects we did that by exposing a formal representation of these linkages as a really simple nested list :)<br/><br/>In this particular case, we’ve designed the language such that ambiguities are pretty rare, but certainly not impossible. The editor we’re building along side this has tools for helping you understand and fix ambiguity if it comes up. We also leverage things like autocomplete to guide you towards unambiguous formulations to being with. Reducing everything down to simple declarative statements and single line actions gives us a ton of leverage to make both the meaning of things clear and keep the editing experience really natural.

It’s also worth pointing out that despite this being an extremely high level language, that doesn’t have to come at the cost of performance. The backend was able to match handwritten and carefully tuned rust in some of our experiments. The only reason the rust ended up being faster was because I dropped down to SIMD intrinsics and we’re generating JS right now, which doesn’t have access to SIMD.

Josh (from Eve) and I left our jobs and are doing this off of savings at the moment. Our goal is to try to put something impactful enough together that we can create a sustainable small business around it. :slightly_smiling_face:

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span> your comment "operator-heavy languages like Haskell with math notation" makes me ponder whether scenarios where operators feel best might be those where a diagram would do better.  :thinking_face:

This isn't a critique, just a stray thought about visual representation:<br/>The transition from rhetorical algebra (verbal descriptions of relationships) to symbolic language is commonly lauded as a large improvement in the UI for maths.<br/><br/>Do you disagree with this in general/think it only applies to "low-level" concerns/think it only applies to symbolically-inclined individuals?<br/><br/>The inverse approach might be to try to extend mathematical notation to better represent the "high-level" concepts end-users want to manipulate. Can this be done without being immediately off-putting to people who aren't big fans of maths? (i.e. normal people!) :smile:

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andrew Reece</span> I think symbolic representations are useful when you need to do algebra (symbolic manipulation/evaluation). But programmers don’t want to do this: they simply want to write something down, and be able to easily read it later. We make the <em>computer</em> do the algebra when we hit “Run”.
