However I concluded that this approach didn't bring any additional value, besides being nice to show to management level people. I tend to think that UI is not that important, no\/lowcode fits for certain cases, maybe 20% of cases at maximum. So I'm not worried about the UI-aspect. Something like Node-RED would be possible to do for Operon, and currently I see that kind of approach to bring the most value.",
