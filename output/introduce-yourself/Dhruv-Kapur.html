Hi awesome people :wave: I am Dhruv from India. I have been working with ThoughtWorks as a data engineer for about 4.5 years and as a developer trainer for the next 2.5 years. I’m really passionate about teaching and mentoring new developers. <br/>I teach about the fundamentals of OOP, clean code, TDD and CI/CD. A big part of my teaching goes towards how to approach a problem in a structured manner and motivating people to approach things in different ways.<br/>I also teach intermediate developers about big data tooling and make them ready for being a individual contributor for “data” projects.<br/>I am excited to be a part of this group so that I can share some new ideas with my trainees. I’m also inspired by the visions of Bret Victor and the future of programming excites me.
