if a rectangle was a record holding two vectors, then referring to the left side of a rectangle would be a very clumsy expression box.pos.x  vs. the simpler box.left.  I agree that once you use x and y you might be thinking of the center point, however in all systems i am aware of that use upper left corner of the screen as the origin, the first coordinate of a rectangle is the upper left corner. That dates back to Apple's Quickdraw, which used .left, .top, .width, and .height, although one could in Object Pascal and Modula-2 via a fixed length structure like this interchangably as a point of xy and a record of h and v, or whatever you notation pleased you. Untagged record variants was in those languages.

My preferred representation for a rectangle is none of thoseâ€” I find it cleaner to work like: <tt>struct Rect { vec lo, vec hi }</tt>, where <tt>lo</tt> and <tt>hi</tt> respectively hold the smallest and largest coordinates along each axis. Then the logic for a rect collapses to range arithmetic (i.e. unions, intersections, translations, etc. are natural using max/min, including with empty rectangles).<br/><br/>This also admits "signed" rectangles which may contain their interior or exterior, if that makes sense for your application (otherwise, lo &gt; hi can be considered "empty").<br/><br/>I have also found it advisable that the range be inclusive (i.e. both endpoints are considered part of the rectangle) to avoid special cases and "preferred coordinate frames" where some edges of the rectangle are "special". This is somewhat contrary to typical range conventions in programming, but I've found from experience that it saves headache.<br/><br/>That presentation also generalizes to higher dimensions nicely.

if the center of the rectangle is of interest in your app (it probably will be), then it makes sense to expose a convenience function to compute or set it on demand (at basically negligible expense)
