        "text": "Hey <@UJCHWTMH6>, inspired after attending <http:\/\/recurse.com\/>, I’ve been trying to bring a similar concept to life for two years now — much smaller in scope and objective, but not shy of a similar vision. We managed to do a super-small but insightful prototype event in Hamburg, then an exceptionally well-planned “minimum viable experience” in Berlin (<https:\/\/www.eventbrite.de\/e\/levelup-sprint-ios-development-registration-46756773769?ref=eios>) which turned out to not happen. As a result of that we changed direction slightly (I guess it’s called “pivot”), dropped the plan to turn this into a business, and had a successful event in Budapest with 10 attendees in November last year. And now we’re planning to iterate on that with an upcoming event near Helsinki in July.\n\nAt this point I can say that we know how to run a good event, yet we still have no idea how to turn this into a viable business. It’s mostly a labor of love and passion at the moment, “paid” only by the positive change attendees leave the weekend with and the strong feeling of connection we can create in a small group after just three days.\n\nIn these last three years my perspective went from “Ah, I can build a better Recurse Center \/ recreate something like Dynamicland in Europe” to “Hmm, that’s why they decided to do things that way” to “Fuck, this is really, really difficult!”\n\nI sincerely hope you have a good idea of what you’re getting into and am happy to share the things I learned along the way. I would love to see more places like this to exist around the world, where good people with good ideas can work on the future. But there are reasons for why not many places like this exist, and why the ones that do are struggling.",

Ten programmers. Five days. One mission: grow. What is a Learning Sprint? It’s a new format that brings together passionate programmers to share their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning experience. It’s for intermediate and advanced practitioners who want to improve their skills and techniques in a collaborative and fun learning environment. A Learning Sprint is project-driven and self-directed. You bring your own project and have a rough plan of what you want to accomplish during the sprint. It’s the ideal environment to spend time on that side project you always wanted to work on. Making progress on your project is going to be the most concrete goal you will work towards. However, it will just be the foundation of your learning journey at LevelUP. The real power of LevelUP is the group. Nine other highly motivated peers will join you on this journey and make this sprint a unique and valuable experience. Peer-to-peer learning works without teachers, because everybody is a teacher. We believe that you will learn more and better working directly with other experienced practitioners on the projects you are passionate about.  This sprint’s theme: iOS Development Each Learning Sprint has a theme. This one is about iOS Development. The sprint is not about teaching you iOS Development, it’s about getting better at it. Join a group of experienced iOS developers, hack away on your projects, share tips and techniques, and get dramatically better at building apps for Apple platforms. Bring your published app and work on a new feature. Or finally start that refactoring effort or architecture change. Or take the week to experiment with the new features and APIs Apple just launched at WWDC. Collaborate with other iOS developers and learn their tricks and techniques. And as a bonus, you can receive feedback, pair-program, debug, or analyze the performance of your app with a former Apple Technology Evangelist. Learn Present your ideas and work to others and receive valuable feedback. Discover what others are working on and be inspired by their ideas and perspectives. Learn how others work, about their process, and apply tips or groundbreaking changes to your own workflow. Tap into the unique knowledge and experience other participants bring with them. Teach Share what you know, even if you don’t feel like an expert. If you know something others don’t, you can be their expert. Improve your teaching skills and gain deeper understanding by explaining them to others. Enjoy sessions of pair programming, white boarding, and rubber-ducking, and get ready to learn and teach at the same time. Communicate Collaborate with a small and focused group of motivated practitioners. Participate in a safe and open space where everybody feels welcome and included. Become aware of your own biases and learn to detect and prevent subtle communication mishaps we all get wrong sometimes. Improve your communication skills along the way, almost automatically. Experience Connect with diverse personalities with different backgrounds, perspectives, and levels of experience. Improve your skills through real practice and discover how effective and fun learning can be. Enjoy a fabulous time doing what you love with interesting people. Become part of our Passionate Programmers community, make new friends, and stay in touch. Come to spend time on a project you always wanted to work on. Leave as a better learner, teacher, communicator — and have fun and make new friends along the way. How does it work? We start with getting to know each other, the projects we want to work on, and establish our learning goals. Each morning starts with a quick check-in to find out where everyone stands and where we want to go, and how we can help each other making progress. In six time-boxed one-hour sessions you get to spend time pair-programming, white-boarding, rubber-ducking, studying, collaborating, or focusing on your project. In between there’ll be ample time for a proper lunch break and lots of great discussions. At the end of each day, we wrap up with a quick check-out to reflect on what we learned. At the end of the sprint we present to each other what we built during the week, recap what we learned, and then celebrate our achievements. We wrap up Friday night with the chance to get to know some other members of the Passionate Programmers community. Having finished a LevelUP Learning Sprint, you’ll become part of our community and can stay in touch with your sprint team as well as other passionate programmers on our Slack channel. Facilitators Two experienced and independent facilitators will help you get the most out of your sprint. They will provide guidance, coaching, and just a little bit of structure to set everyone up for a productive week. They will moderate daily check-ins and check-outs, help with planning each day’s sessions, encourage collaboration, and assist you with anything you have questions about during the sprint. They also bring their own experience and knowledge to the sprint and you are welcome to work with them just as with everybody else in the group. Your facilitators for this sprint: Birgit Nieschalk, trainer, architect of human interaction, former IT project and partner manager. Ask her about: teaching and facilitation tools agile practices decoding your own and other’s behaviour (Insights Discovery®) getting unstuck Stefan Lesser, passionate programmer, app architect, and former Apple Technology Evangelist.

As a result of that we changed direction slightly (I guess it’s called “pivot”), dropped the plan to turn this into a business, and had a successful event in Budapest with 10 attendees in November last year. And now we’re planning to iterate on that with an upcoming event near Helsinki in July.\n\nAt this point I can say that we know how to run a good event, yet we still have no idea how to turn this into a viable business. It’s mostly a labor of love and passion at the moment, “paid” only by the positive change attendees leave the weekend with and the strong feeling of connection we can create in a small group after just three days.\n\nIn these last three years my perspective went from “Ah, I can build a better Recurse Center \/ recreate something like Dynamicland in Europe” to “Hmm, that’s why they decided to do things that way” to “Fuck, this is really, really difficult!”\n\nI sincerely hope you have a good idea of what you’re getting into and am happy to share the things I learned along the way. I would love to see more places like this to exist around the world, where good people with good ideas can work on the future. But there are reasons for why not many places like this exist, and why the ones that do are struggling."

        "text": "At first, I thought that impact of The Research Centre would come from creating software that solves real problems, and that people will actually use.\n\nBut that's not quite right. The impact of Xerox PARC wasn't specifically in the Smalltalk-80 software, it was in the theoretical concepts they developed, such as Object Oriented Programming, and the Graphical User Interface. These are such good ideas that they have been continually reimplemented and refined by many different software projects.\n\nFor example, Steve Krouse has this vision of comprehensible Functional Reactive Programming, which is modular and composable, and also easy to understand. A good solution to this research problem might lead to lots of independent implementations in many languages.\n\nBut even that concept of impact needs further tweaking. The impact of Doug Englebart's NLS system is usually remembered in terms of certain technologies that he pioneered, such as windows, the mouse, hypertext, etc. But those things are subsidiary to the goals that Englebart set for his project, which was the augmentation of human intellect, on both a personal and on a group level, in order to tackle the important and pressing challenges of the world, using a bootstrapping process to accelerate innovation while maximizing results. [Eg, see \"Englebart's Unfinished Revolution\", <http:\/\/www.dougengelbart.org\/content\/view\/223\/>]\n\nSo I think the most important thing is to enumerate the goals of the next software revolution. And that will define what research problems need to be solved.

The impact of Xerox PARC wasn't specifically in the Smalltalk-80 software, it was in the theoretical concepts they developed, such as Object Oriented Programming, and the Graphical User Interface. These are such good ideas that they have been continually reimplemented and refined by many different software projects.\n\nFor example, Steve Krouse has this vision of comprehensible Functional Reactive Programming, which is modular and composable, and also easy to understand. A good solution to this research problem might lead to lots of independent implementations in many languages.\n\nBut even that concept of impact needs further tweaking. The impact of Doug Englebart's NLS system is usually remembered in terms of certain technologies that he pioneered, such as windows, the mouse, hypertext, etc. But those things are subsidiary to the goals that Englebart set for his project, which was the augmentation of human intellect, on both a personal and on a group level, in order to tackle the important and pressing challenges of the world, using a bootstrapping process to accelerate innovation while maximizing results.
