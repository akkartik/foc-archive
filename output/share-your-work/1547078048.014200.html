Hello everyone, At Postman (<a href="http://getpostman.com">getpostman.com</a>), we are thinking of a flow-based programming DSL + UI language to help people build API Workflows. The discussion is going on here in our issue tracker: <a href="https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/5707">https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/5707</a>. Iâ€™d love to know your thoughts regarding the typical reservations that programmers have towards UI based tools. Some of them are in the comments in the issue I referenced. Postman has millions of people today that we feel will benefit from the ability to program workflows quickly but want to make sure that we end up building the right thing.

Based on my work experience as a UX designer, I feel that there is very strong split between different types users on whether they prefer coding or not.<br/><br/>Some people have very strong wish to be able to type raw code (SQL, DSL, Lua, etc) and get frustrated with UI-based tools. If there is an option to either use UI or code, they always check the code first.<br/><br/>While others are scared of typing even a single line of code but can do very complex (possibly even Turing-complete!) configurations using a UI. But if something they perceive as coding is required, they ask somebody else to help.<br/><br/>This is definitely something to take into account when building a tool. The UI should be based on the types of users you have for the tool.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Janne Aukia</span> Thanks for the feedback. That is very helpful and I agree, there is a clear split between code vs non-code. One thing that I am trying to figure out if there is are use cases that are hard to code or feel repetitive even with code but can be visualized or built much better using a UI. A question for us is whether there are some things that programmers feel are inherently hard to put together in the context of API driven workflows

I don't know postman that well. As a coder I find there are tons of repetitive tasks. A good editor helps me with those tasks. I can copy and paste from other code. I can search and replace after I've copied. I can regex search and replace or keyboard macro search and replace. In other words, the fact that it's text is a force multiplier.<br/><br/>Whether that fits users of postman I have no idea.<br/><br/>I mostly come from games and an example of frustrating for me would be for example a typical 3D program vs raw code. In draw code I can type<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap"><br/>[<br/>   "images/playbutton.jpg",<br/>]<br/></pre><br/><br/>And then as new buttons are added I can just copy and paste and edit<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap"><br/>[<br/>   "images/playbutton.jpg",<br/>   "images/pausebutton.jpg",<br/>   "images/rewindbutton.jpg",<br/>   "images/fastforwardbutton.jpg",<br/>   "images/stopbutton.jpg",<br/>]<br/></pre><br/><br/>That literally took 10 seconds to edit. Fast enough I it didn't interrupt my flow typing this comment. In many UI environments that ends up being 4x to 16x the work. Pick "import image", dialog appear, select image, set a bunch of manual settings, repeat, etc. And, even after I've managed to get all my stuff in the editor I then have to hook them up.<br/><br/>Random feedback (which probably is not useful but going to throw it out there)<br/><br/>Maya (the 3d package) has a feature that you can select any number of objects and then pull up spreadsheet view showing all their properties. Each row is an object, each column is a property. If one object hasn't have that property it's cell is marked in some way.<br/><br/>It's in this way you can quickly compare a bunch of properties across object as well as edit them.<br/><br/>I say that's not useful because I think, though I'm not really a Maya user, that not that many Maya users use that feature. I guess I'd have to go ask.<br/><br/>I mostly just bring it up as one example of a way to help power users with UIs that end up getting in their way more than helping.
