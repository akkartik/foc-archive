as.for.open source my first open source started in the early 90s for purely selfish reasons. I had a bunch of C libraries I wanted to be able to use at my job but without them taking ownership. I didn't need/want them to pay me for the libraries I just wanted to make my life easier.<br/><br/>I have a friend who has a very popular open source library . popular enough it's nearly a full time job maintaining it. fortunately he got hired by Google to maintain it but he's been "stuck" with it for like 8 years now. He might enjoy that but I can't imagine myself enjoying feeling stuck on one project so long.<br/><br/>
