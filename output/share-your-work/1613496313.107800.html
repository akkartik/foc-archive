I like the analogy. I think it nicely suggests the human elements that are (should be) in api design. I think there's an important piece of the story missing, though: how do you learn? You called it out yourself: if you don't know how le nix works, you walk out in disgust (and more than likely embarrassment). Anybody can walk into Smilies and end up eating the food they want. I think there's a number of dimensions to this as well. What does this learning mean? Is it about the developer community? The documentation? A cs degree vs. a bootcamp? Formally educated vs. self-taught?

By the time I got to the final section I had a different conclusion than you.<br/><br/>In every activity you have to decide who your audience is. Restaurants are for users, so we should make them more like Smilies. It's only when we make things for programmers that we should make them more like Unix. More amenable to composition in larger, unanticipated aggregations.<br/><br/>This feels a lot more nuanced than your conclusion, "It turns out, the most important user of a program is not a human using a program." I don't think that's always true. It depends on what the program is.

Yeah, true, but I think programs still win out 99% of the time because 99% of the functionality can live outside of the GUI which means the user of that code is code.<br/>The fact that macOS, iOS, and Android, all of which are GUI dominant are unix under the hood is really hard to argue with IMO

A program which is made for other programs can be lifted into a GUI, but the other way doesn't seem so

1. If a program is intended to be lifted into a GUI, its stdout is often hidden. It doesn't matter if it's silent or not. Often there are debuggability benefits to being verbose.<br/>2. GUIs are programs too! Extremely complex programs. Often the most complex part of a program.<br/><br/>I should say that you're <em>totally</em> feeding my biases here. I've spent the last 5 years arguing that programs should focus on programmers, and that people should go out of their comfort zones to understand computers. (Because the alternative cedes too much power.)<br/><br/>But focusing on programmers can sometimes involve providing lots of information so that a run is more intelligible. One of my favorite tricks is emitting facts deduced to a log, and having tests make assertions on the log (<a href="http://akkartik.name/post/tracing-tests">http://akkartik.name/post/tracing-tests</a>). So I still think you're over-generalizing from Unix here. All we can conclude in general is that programs should probably provide a silent mode and a verbose mode, and which one you operate in depends on the situation. That's a lot less interesting for a blog post, though :slightly_smiling_face:

1. Oh it totallly does matter because if you use that program in non-gui mode then stdout is the way you interact with it. Otherwise you're repurposing stdout as a logging output. Logging output is valuable but then just log to a file.<br/>2. They are programs and should be the simplest part of the program because they're so hard to compose with other programs<br/>-v to verbose say things other than what's surprising is a common unix option but that's opt in, not opt out.

Are you assuming an architecture where the GUI shell for a program is always in a separately runnable process? I can imagine it's always a good idea to make it a separate library (MVC) but process separation has costs.<br/><br/>You sound like a bigger UNIX head than the creators of UNIX :slightly_smiling_face: That might be a compliment.

&gt; Otherwise you're repurposing stdout as a logging output. Logging output is valuable but then just log to a file.<br/>There <em>is</em> such a thing as <tt>stderr</tt>. Unix has it for a reason.<br/><br/>&gt; -v to verbose say things other than what's surprising is a common unix option but that's opt in, not opt out.<br/>I'm claiming that there are situations where the right default is a little more verbose than complete silence. Imagine a server where the default log level to stdout is INFO. I've found that handy at times. The real interaction happens in another window, and that frees this one up to be verbose.

haha, I'm flattered but I hold them in too much esteem to consider myself more of a unix head than them. The Art Of Unix Programming completely changed my view of eng design.<br/><br/>I'm imagining an architecture where the GUI can be modularized out. It doesn't need to be a separate process or anything. I'm imagining a layer of code which has API/TUI entry points and that the GUI is built on top of. Then everything below the GUI is easily composable with other programs (esp testing), and the GUI happens to be a nice way to make it easy to interact with the program.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why it matters if there are exceptions to the rule. If you're going to hold a simple rule, it's better to err on the side of silence than on the side of noise. Should you hold a simple rule? I believe so because I've found there's bigger fish to fry.

Not sure what you mean by bigger fish to fry. The first question that leads to for me is: why bother writing this, then?<br/><br/>If you call something a rule and never mention exceptions, then the reader will assume you don't intend exceptions.

I don't think what I'm pointing out are narrow exceptions to a rule at all. Rather this Unix 'rule' (and, indeed, the rest of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy</a>) only applies in a very narrow domain: interactive programming in shell. Not even shell scripts, let alone well-designed GUI and web frameworks. Unix has had ample decades to demonstrate good examples in those areas, and it has failed.
