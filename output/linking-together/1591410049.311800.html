I'm irrationally annoyed that it's impossible for a human to be published in the ACM without an affiliation to a real, registered corporation. The matrix singularity is already here, folks. We've just learned to grow blind to it.

It's not true. A friend of mine had a paper accepted to this year's SigGraph, and his affiliation is "independent researcher".<br/><br/><a href="http://www.mattkeeter.com/research/mpr/">http://www.mattkeeter.com/research/mpr/</a>

I have always strived to convince conference organizers to leave the affiliation field blank when accepting a talk or paper from me. With my first paper (at UseNix), I had to be very insistent, but the editor eventually caved. He explained that he had to make changes to the macro package he was using (I don't remember if it was TeX or troff) in order to leave the field blank. My most recent conference was StarCon. I had to push back a little about leaving the field blank: I provided helpful suggestions, such as "just use n/a", or "try typing a non-breaking space character into the field". Anyway, that conference had a strong mandate to support individuals from minority groups and with disabilities, and they accomodated my special needs without any additional back and forth conversation.

You're right. They gave me that option, but I dismissed it early yesterday, and then forgot about it.<br/><br/>I'm not an "independent researcher". The paper is "independent research".<br/><br/>But yeah this is a much more pedantic point, and my OP was being unfair :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks for reminding me, Doug.
