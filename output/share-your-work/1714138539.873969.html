The future of code involves waiting for Copilots (Even though they get faster all the time, we'll just ask more and more of them).<br/><br/>We took a stab at visualizing the design decisions that our Copilot makes while it's coding the design you've prompted it for.<br/><br/>Instead of just spinners or the raw stream of text like chat UIs, we overlay this visualization where the design will appear on the canvas. Each visualization reflects a design variant that Copilot works on, and is computed in real-time based on the token streams from the LLM.
