I've been research Smalltalk recently and I've been struck by is how similar the Smalltalk IDE is to Emacs. In particular they are both programming environments that can be modified live while they're running, with some similar bells and whistles such as easily viewing and modifying function definitions, and debugger integration. Given all these commonalities I'm surprised Emacs doesn't come up more often when discussing the Smalltalk. I'd love to hear any opinions on Smalltalk vs. Emacs, and in particular where Emacs falls short in fulfilling the promise os Smalltalk?

Emacs is a programmable environment. However, the level of what can be expressed is limited by the text-terminal assumption. By now, we should outgrow that assumption.<br/>The other difference comes from the fact that the Smalltalk IDE lives in the same VM as the application, while Emacs runs in a different runtime

I agree with both points, a couple of follow-up questions: For #1 re the text-terminal assumption, what do you think are the most compelling use-cases where this is a limitation? For #2 this actually seems sort of like a point in Emacs favor, in the Emacs case, you can A) modify the Emacs environment itself, or B) edit an application in Emacs, that itself is entirely external to Emacs. I think that you're saying Smalltalk doesn't have a way to do B because it's focus is on doing A (correct me if I'm wrong)? That actually seems more like a limitation of Smalltalk than an issue with Emacs?

In Pharo, we can both work locally or remotely. So, we can choose between A) and B), we are not forced to use B).

About the limitation: For example, we cannot do visualizations in a text-based interface.

For working locally and remotely, that sounds the same as Emacs then. I think I might have misunderstood this part then "Smalltalk IDE lives in the same VM as the application, while Emacs runs in a different runtime"?

&gt;Smalltalk IDE lives in the same VM as the application, while Emacs runs in a different runtime<br/>Let's say you have a system that includes <tt>persons</tt>. In Smalltalk, the class <tt>Person</tt> and the class <tt>Browser</tt> live in the same image and their instances live in the same image as well that is run with the same virtual machine. The system can be built from within, not from outside.

I used Emacs for many years and liked it. It is primarily a Unix application, while ST is primarily a separate system. Yes, there is a similarity in that you can modify and inspect things live. It's still apples to oranges because ST is a whole system while Emacs is not. So Emacs still deals with files and such things  which are outside itself - in the Unix system. The in-memory world of functions and lists is not the same as the outside world of files and processes. Consider when you modify some function in-memory, it will vanish the next time restart Emacs. You'll have to separately install the function in some .el file somewhere. ST deals only with objects and these are all inside the ST world. It has an automatic persistent image. When you create new classes and objects they are always there.<br/><br/>I assume many JS editors are also editable live (VSCode?) because you have access to the VM and the objects it runs?

Great point about the difference the automatic persistent image makes about in-memory changes not persisting in Emacs. That's definitely true and it's pretty difficult problem to work around in Emacs.<br/><br/>That's also absolutely true that the Electron/JavaScript editors are also editable live. At least I'm crystal clear on this in the case of Atom, I actually wrote an Atom plugin for modifying the system live <a href="https://atom.io/packages/run-in-atom">https://atom.io/packages/run-in-atom</a><br/><br/>I will say it's still quite different from Emacs though, the Emacs ecosystem is designed around facilitating live modification in way that the JavaScript editors definitely aren't.
