<a href="https://blokdots.com">https://blokdots.com</a><br/><br/>&gt;  Following that interest, <a href="https://olivierbrueckner.de/">Olivier Brückner</a>, who studied industrial design at the time, did some extracurricular experiences in interaction design. During this time, a lot of interaction design students, as well as industrial design students, came up to him, asking for help. They needed support connecting components like buttons or writing a couple of lines of code, e.g., to let an LED pulse—relatively simple stuff for experienced people, yet hard for absolute beginners.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; In 2017 Olivier based his bachelor thesis on bridging the gap between the two disciplines. Based on his experiences with the students looking for help, he designed a tool to create hardware prototypes easily—blokdots was born.
