If you ask a person from Egypt, Poland, Singapore, India, Japan or Russia, people probably wouldn't even understand what does it mean. I think it is not as universal as it may look like.\n\nStill, majority of the members of this community are from North America and it has an impact on the discussions that we have, I understand that.\n\n&gt; many people, simply because of the circumstances of their life, have had an unfairly diminished role in shaping the technology that now surrounds them\n&gt; Seeking to empower these people is an inherently humane thing to do\nHelping those who are struggling is a noble pursuit and hardly anyone would oppose that. I am sure that most members of this community would help a struggling stranger without any questions. I do that too.\n\nThe problem arises when this pursuit conflicts with other value: one should be judged on his merits.\n\nThere was a scandal in Harvard university. Some applicants were favored over the other solely based on their ethnic background in pursuit of inclusion and diversity[1].
