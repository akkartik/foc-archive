It doesn't feel right to spam this group with all the details as that's arguably borderline off-topic, so I've been looking for a good way to have a discussion with those all-in on Alexander elsewhere. This will also enable me to bring people together across a few different communities.\n\nRecently, I had a good experience with a pop-up Telegram chat group that was hosted temporarily after an online event for further discussion. This seems like a good light-weight format for the purpose I have in mind. There's no great master plan, just a few little ideas I'd like to develop further with you.\n\nIf you are interested in upcoming activities around Christopher Alexander, his magnum opus _The Nature of Order_, and how to apply his theories to other domains (software and technology in particular), I'd like to invite you to join me here: <https:\/\/t.me\/joinchat\/RaDQv_BGCm7OcPaP>\n\nThis is a low-volume announcement-ish channel if you just want to stay up to date on what's happening. And there is a linked chat if you want to engage in a more active capacity — asking questions, discussing concepts, suggesting ideas, and more.\nLooking forward to seeing you there!",
