Hi!<br/><br/>it's been a long time since I posted in this group (almost 5 years, wow!). Life changed on my side (working full-time jobs, having kids, ...) but I still tried to follow what's going on occasionally. Thanks a lot to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mariano Guerra</span> for the newsletter, it's the perfect digest for me to read whenever I have some spare time.<br/><br/>I've recently started using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> and it's working great for me to collect and organize all kinds of thoughts. I've used quite a few tools for this over the years, but Obsidian is my new favorite. I'm sure it's been discussed here already, but here's what I love about it:<br/>• based on markdown files instead of some proprietary formats<br/>• great apps for desktop and mobile<br/>• effortless e2e-encrypted sync between devices<br/>• linking between files / pages and following those links is easy. I'm using a variation of a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/">Zettelkasten</a> (<a href="https://obsidian.rocks/getting-started-with-zettelkasten-in-obsidian/#My-Process-for-Zettelkasten-in-Obsidian">this link</a> can be useful as a starting point; I can write about my approach if there's interest in it)<br/>I'm currently trying to collect my FoC ideas, projects and thoughts into my Obsidian and therefore wanted to see my contributions to this community. I used the <a href="http://akkartik.name/archives/foc/">Archive</a> tool by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> and it's been working great. A simple long webpage and Ctrl-F worked beautifully, probably better than what Slack Pro could have given me. Thanks a lot for creating the archive, Kartik!<br/><br/>Going back in time was very interesting. One thing I noticed though was that quite a few links that we discussed at the time sadly don't work anymore. With the help of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">wayback machine</a>, I was able to still access all the info though. This made me once again appreciate the wayback machine and its importance for the internet. Feels like a donation to the project is overdue.<br/><br/>That's all I wanted to share. Have a great day folks :)
