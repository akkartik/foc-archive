I'm Martijn Brekelmans, although I prefer to go by Laura because of ... reasons!<br/>I'm an employed software engineer, got my diploma as a computer engineering student, which is: 1 year EE, 3 years CS, trained to program chips, learn C, C++, Linux systems programming, driver development, FPGA's, etcetcetc...<br/>Buuttt I work as a full-stack web-developer for now, PHP, JavaScript and MySQL, the original stack :stuck_out_tongue:<br/>I'm always exploring something or building something new, because I like exploration and finding out what is possible.<br/><br/>As for most people here, I also have an unhealthy obsession with Bret Victor's work.<br/><br/>Most of my work revolves around data visualisation, playing with language &amp; words, interactive toys &amp; generative art and various experiments with user interfaces, programming languages and code-editor software/insights. Although I don't usually share much of what I do, I think this place is perfect for feedback and discussions!
