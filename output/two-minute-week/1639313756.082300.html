The big overhaul from the last week has been stuck because of me not thinking through carefully and trying to implement too many cool features simultaneously :grimacing: — very typical of me.<br/><br/>I’ve spent the week reading papers on CPS trying to figure out how to cook it. I still don’t have a good solution, but I am not giving up yet. (Being stuck sucks, but the practical experience is exactly what I am fishing for with this project.) <a href="https://www.alexeyshmalko.com/alpha-6/">https://www.alexeyshmalko.com/alpha-6/</a>
