E.g., in the Machine Augmented Test Driven Development section, the layout there sounds very much likely discussing a protocol with a human, then coming back the next day and experimenting with it.\n\n<@UMQ6LR9NZ> I feel you here, and I don’t know what to do about this. I actually spent the $20 to get access to ChatGPT Plus just to see what it was like in comparison. With `llama` above, I actually have that running on my M1 air too! It works interestingly enough, but I don’t have that tuning brain yet to understand what I can change to get better results for what I’m trying to prompt for.",
