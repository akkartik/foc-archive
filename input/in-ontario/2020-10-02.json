With <#C01BKSG4ZFT|in-alberta>, we have folks from Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and points beyond (like me — I'm super rural). While we do (or did, sigh) all our meetups in Calgary, the channel was meant to be inclusive of everyone in Alberta, so it's entirely possible that we might do a meetup in Edmonton if we get more members there, too.\n\nSo that's the thinking. If you'd like me to rename it back to #in-kitchener-waterloo I can, but I think there are downsides to splintering these location-specific channels up into too fine a granularity.\n\nAs for the Ontario, California overlap... it's such a bummer that \"CA\" is both the California state abbreviation AND the Canada country abbreviation, otherwise we could do #in-ontario-ca. If you're willing to keep the channel scope a little broader (so that we don't also end up with an #in-toronto at some point, say)... I'd love suggestions for what the name could be that strikes the right balance between being open to folks from a larger area, but not from across the continent due to namespace pollution.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's your channel!
