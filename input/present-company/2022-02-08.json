Thank you for the thoughts.\n\nRegarding building this UI stuff, I actually find it not fun at all. :disappointed: To be honest, it's the last thing I want to be doing. The problem is I want cross-platform, desktop GUIs. No platform supports this in a way that's anywhere remotely sane. It's just all so ridiculously complicated. Last year, I settled on using <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/CC2JRGVLK\/p1611939780029400?thread_ts=1611869614.020200&amp;cid=CC2JRGVLK|Racket's GUI toolkit to build out some prototypes>, but I just couldn't get things to work, was discovering bugs in the toolkit, lack of documentation, etc. And in the end, what I needed from the toolkit wasn't well supported and was basically leaving me to manually draw and code UI elements, which is not that much more than simply relying on Skia and going from there.\n\nYou are right regarding design though. I could spend some more time on that. I have been learning pieces of Figma as a design tool. Although, I have a pretty good idea of what I want to build, and that's pretty quickly going to require some actual prototyping to get a feel for how to do it, as there are some technical challenges that I know will be there.\n\nI've considered just giving up for now and using something like Flutter. My bare minimal GLFW window plus Skia drawing to the canvas works on Windows but crashes on macOS (but worked before the last macOS update). :cry:",

I could spend some more time on that. I have been learning pieces of Figma as a design tool. Although, I have a pretty good idea of what I want to build, and that's pretty quickly going to require some actual prototyping to get a feel for how to do it, as there are some technical challenges that I know will be there.\n\nI've considered just giving up for now and using something like Flutter. My bare minimal GLFW window plus Skia drawing to the canvas works on Windows but crashes on macOS (but worked before the last macOS update). "
