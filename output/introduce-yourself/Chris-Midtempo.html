So, a quick introduction.<br/><br/>My name’s Chris, a Kiwi living on the Norfolk coast (UK). I’m a web/systems architect who’s been building things online since ’98, mostly as a solo/self-contained do-everything - was LAMP, now working in Node/React/Next + a little Python/Tensorflow.<br/><br/>Two years ago, I jumped into corporate life for some stability/security, designing/building a chatbot management platform for a large financial company – structured conversations, rather than GenAi (firmly of the belief that LLMs are not – and may never be – capable of truth).<br/><br/>Outside of the paid stuff, I’m working on a music streaming system that dynamically selects songs by analysing and blending the key/intensity/harmonics when one track ends and the next begins. It’s a not-for-profit, zero user-tracking, not-looking-for-funding project. You can <a href="https://midtempo.net/">listen here</a>.<br/><br/>Away from a screen, I keep bees and spend time in our pottery studio - where I’m still (and will forever be) learning to throw.
