I was reading the description of Tic-tac-toe in Wikipedia and start daydreaming on the smallest and easier to understand program for it.<br/>First here is the relevant paragraph from Wikipedia: <tt>The game can be generalized to an m,n,k-game in which two players alternate placing stones of their own color on an m×n board, with the goal of getting k of their own color in a row. Tic-tac-toe is the (3,3,3)-game.</tt><br/><br/>I came up with a program divided in 3 parts:<br/>1. A declarative set of rules<br/>2. A state machine for game transitions<br/>3. A visual specification for the screens<br/><br/>Here are the set of rules:<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap"><br/>Space: X, O or empty<br/>Board: 3x3 table of spaces<br/>Board full: Board has no empty spaces<br/>End game: Board full or Win<br/>Win: Row, Column or Diagonal of same Player token<br/>Draw: Board full and not win<br/><br/>Player token: X, O<br/>Human player: Choose a player token<br/>Computer player: Remaining token not chosen by human player<br/><br/>Player move: Choose empty space (Choose could be done with the mouse, keyboard, or other input device)<br/>Computer move: Randomly choose empty space<br/></pre><br/><br/>Some rules in a Haskell like language:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap"><br/>Space = X | O | Empty<br/>Board = Space[3][3]<br/>fullBoard board = none board (\space -&gt; space == Empty)<br/></pre><br/><br/>I tried to have the rules read as close as possible to English. I see some rules really close (and easy to represent) in a language like Haskell.<br/>Other rules are probably to high level to be easy for a computer to understand (specially the winning logic)<br/><br/>Here is the state machine. Doesn’t have the best layout, I just used the first web site I could find to generate it:
