You categorically cannot claim to speak for everyone everywhere in every situation in order to discount \"race, religion, etc\" as factors of experience, and your very attempt to do so somewhat concerning...! I also encourage you to consider the very important distinctions between 'observation' and (lived) experience...\n\n_\"...but has more to do with the fact that nerds are like cacti, a fussy, prickly bunch.\"_ - Edward this is an incredibly reductive and cliché characterisation and again, if you have managed to surround yourself solely with other 'nerds' who are 'like cacti', then that's quite an achievement on your part, however I think it is far more likely you are in fact sadly stereotyping even your own friends and acquaintances purely to try and forge your point. As a 'nerd', and one who knows a whole lot of other 'nerds', I utterly reject your idea of me\/us, and even if\/when we have prickly moments (which surely I do, too), that is not a get-out-of-jail free card for how I (mis)treat others, and how I (mis)understand the situations around me...\n\n_\"No other profession i can think of has so few advantages granted for nepotism.\"_ Edward, nepotism is not the issue being discussed here, unless we expand an idea of 'family' to include class\/culture\/race\/gender\/etc in which case yes, tech industry is just as susceptible to 'nepotism' as anywhere else. As a white-european-man I have become increasingly conscious of the situations in which those markers have been what helped get me 'hired' (above a baseline of 'competence' for the required task), as i have 'fit-in', as 'one of the family'....!\n\n_\"In my firm only 10 out of 50 employees survived 6 months, because they couldn't do the job.\"_ That is an incredible statistic Edward which should have you asking serious questions about the workspace in which you operate, and the 'culture' you have generated. I would sorely love to chat with the 40 folks who left and see how they _felt_ in that space...\n\n_\"How someone looked, or where they were from was not a factor.\"_ Unfortunately, you simply cannot make this claim outright because the effects of discrimination run so insidiously and in so many micro-veins, confounded further by unconscious bias etc... even the most self-aware\/pro-active workplaces cannot (but would not try) make that claim. The best anyone\/organisation can do is listen, listen, listen, try, try, try, and ensure that their awareness, sensitivity, and response is a little bit better than it was yesterday...\n\nI encourage you to step aside from your evident existing position, and also step aside from 'online chat'\/forums\/twitter\/etc which I'm sure has been part of what's fueled your 'maddening' feeling, and instead take time to deeply consider other perspectives, both observation and experience based, via more considered medium such as the books posted above. Also, please feel free to DM me if you'd like to continue this discussion less publicly.",
