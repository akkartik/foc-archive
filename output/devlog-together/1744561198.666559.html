If you enjoyed fooling with parsers, I would recommend looking into <a href="http://ohmjs.org">OhmJS</a>. OhmJS (plus Ohm-editor) saves a lot of work when building parsers. A game changer. There is the other half, too - once you've parsed something, what do you do with the information? I've found that doing simple string-rewriting is very, very powerful, while sounding overly-restrictive on the surface. One can design and build whole new languages by transpiling them into existing languages for compilation (that's how I use my 't2t' and 'tmx' stuff). I consider the shell (/bin/bash, /bin/zsh, etc.) to be my IDE. PLs are just "little tools" that plug into the IDE. I don't have to stick to using one language. I can pick and choose. Transpiling a new language (or nano-DSL, or Diagrammatic Programming Language) into some other language fits neatly into this workflow. The fact that OhmJS is written in JS doesn't mean that you have to use JS. You can map XYZ to Lua (or whatever). I can supply a /lot/ more info, if this interests you.
