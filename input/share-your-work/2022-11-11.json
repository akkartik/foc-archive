It has to be priority #1 before concerns like product and UX. Of course those concerns are very important. Without them you don't have anything! But lots of startups do them right and never get to EUP, and that's not my, maybe our, priority.\n\nIt's a little like competing with anchors on our feet, but the hope is that the constraint might lead to something more timeless, durable, valuable, meaningful.\n\nHere the web frontend isn't the thing, it's only the thing that takes you to the thing. The thing\/goal is something that can be programmed. If the web frontend is too integrated there's less impetus to program, and we learn less about EUP from it. So I'd say some jank in the experience is mandatory. This thing needs to be begging people to improve it for themselves. There should be some very obvious improvements that people can make. And then the experiment is to see if anybody cares.\n\nI'm biased, of course. Val.town built this \"app\" for me :slightly_smiling_face: It's definitely gotten me programming on it.",

It has to be priority #1 before concerns like product and UX. Of course those concerns are very important. Without them you don't have anything! But lots of startups do them right and never get to EUP, and that's not my, maybe our, priority.\n\nIt's a little like competing with anchors on our feet, but the hope is that the constraint might lead to something more timeless, durable, valuable, meaningful.\n\nHere the web frontend isn't the thing, it's only the thing that takes you to the thing. The thing\/goal is something that can be programmed. If the web frontend is too integrated there's less impetus to program, and we learn less about EUP from it. So I'd say some jank in the experience is mandatory. This thing needs to be begging people to improve it for themselves. There should be some very obvious improvements that people can make. And then the experiment is to see if anybody cares.\n\nI'm biased, of course. Val.town built this \"app\" for me "
