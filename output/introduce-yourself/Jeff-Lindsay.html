Hey everyone! I'm Jeff. Thought I'd try a new online community and this seemed like a good one. Like a lot of you, I assume, I think about this topic a lot. Maybe too much. Some notable background: back in the day I coined and popularized webhooks to try and make the web more programmable. I created a bunch of stuff to encourage and support adoption including a free tool called localtunnel that a friend turned into a company called Ngrok, if anybody's used that. Later I helped prototype Docker and built a bunch of Docker stuff in the early days. Like a tiny PaaS called Dokku. I kind of just like building what I think needs to exist and then quickly moving on.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm in the Berkeley area if anybody wants to meet up or if there's an existing FoC in-person thing around here. I've kind of really been into the old Bell Labs projects Plan 9 and Inferno lately. If there's any Plan 9 curious people, we're hosting an online hangout / watch party for Plan 9 stuff in my quiet little Discord tomorrow night. Let me know if anybody wants an invite.<br/><br/>Otherwise, here for the vibes and to hopefully meet some cool people if I can remember how. :v:
