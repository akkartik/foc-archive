There are costs to adding another platform, regardless of which platform that is. Let's make sure we identify those costs and weigh them against any potential benefit.<br/><br/>• We'd all have to check multiple places in order to keep up with all the conversations. Personally, I'd like to have fewer things to remember to check up on.<br/>• I can see people self-organizing into whichever place they feel more comfortable, rather than organizing along the lines of "Slack is for X kinds of dialog, OTHER is for Y kinds of dialog". We can intend for all sorts of usage patterns to emerge, but unless there's something explicit in the medium (eg: 280 char limit) people will use it in every way it can be used.<br/>• We'd also have to make a decision about where to start each conversation, not knowing how the conversation will evolve. Often, a short slack message will spawn a sprawling conversation, or a long slack post will just get a bunch of short "me too" replies.<br/>• We'd also need to communicate to all newcomers why they need to interact with the community on different platforms for different kinds of discussion. That sounds unwelcoming, because it tells every newcomer that there's such a thing as "doing it wrong", which some people will be afraid of transgressing.<br/>• Are mailing lists <em>that much better</em> for long form conversation? Sure, it's annoying to read long posts in Slack threads.. but it's also annoying to use Google Groups on your phone (and I mostly interact with this group when I'm on my phone).
