However, in my personal project that I post about here, Copilot helps a lot less and feels more like a supercharged type assistant, still very helpful though. I pay for it myself and I think it's worth it. I didn't ask permission to use it for my day job, luckily we can work on our local personal machines.

We need to have 82% test coverage in which copilot really helps a lot. However, in my personal project that I post about here, Copilot helps a lot less and feels more like a supercharged type assistant, still very helpful though. I pay for it myself and I think it's worth it. I didn't ask permission to use it for my day job, luckily we can work on our local personal machines. In the settings of copilot I disabled sharing my code snippets."
