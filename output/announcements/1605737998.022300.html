I've been contacted a team at the University of California that will be applying for a sizeable <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2020/nsf20604/nsf20604.htm">NSF grant</a> to create a research institute. The focus of their application will be <em>Theme 1: Human-AI Interaction and Collaboration</em>. If they win the grant, some of the institute's funding would be earmarked for our FoC community. Why us? Well, the applicant feels that novel programming ideas will play a big role in future Human-AI interaction — even if said novel ideas are not AI-focussed themselves — and they want to support research toward that. Why <em>us</em>, specifically? We're an interdisciplinary group with diverse circumstances (industry, academia, indie, hobby), so we may be able to do more with the funding than a more homogenous/traditional group. With our participation, they can help a new kind of cross-pollinated, forward-looking PL-UI vision come closer to existence, and related ideas to spread. Also, apparently, they enjoy the Podcast a lot :)<br/><br/>Worth saying up front: this application faces a big uphill battle, so don't get your hopes up. We've had a few community funding offers lately, and none have panned out (yet). But it's worth taking the opportunity to hone our messaging and goals. If (when!) one of them does come through, we ought to be ready for it.<br/><br/>Here's what I need from you for this grant application:<br/><br/><b>1) Ideas for how we could use the funding.</b> I'll share a few of my own in the replies to give you a sense of the scope and goals. I can't share exactly how much funding has been suggested, but pretend you had at least $5k/month to spend on the community — how would you spend it?<br/><br/><b>2) People to help administrate the ideas from (1).</b> If you would be <em>tentatively</em> willing to do this, please DM me and I'll give you more details. I'll need at least one person for each idea, so if you're willing to help <em>broadly</em>, let me know and I can pick one of the ideas that otherwise doesn't have a potential administrator. This is non-binding, it's just an indication of interest.<br/><br/>The deadline for this is super tight — they'll be moving to the next stage of the application on Monday. We need to get our thoughts together <em>within the next 24 hours</em> so I can synthesize them into a proposal tomorrow.<br/><br/>Even if we aren't selected for this particular grant, I hope this discussion will be generative of ideas for things we could do if (when!) the community eventually receives funding, so feel free to keep the discussion going past tomorrow.  We've had a few of these discussions already, and they've been very helpful for me when talking to potential sponsors / donors.<br/><br/>Thanks everyone!

<b>Directly Funding Research</b><br/><br/>Modelled after programming grants like Google Summer of Code, Ruby Together, and Clojurists Together, we could use grant funding to directly pay researchers in our community to work on their research for a set period of time. We would first select a handful of community members to form an evaluation committee. Interested FoC researchers would then pitch to the committee, suggesting the area that they would explore and the deliverables they hoped to produce (like a prototype, paper, talk, or interactive article). The committee would select a project or two per quarter (based on available funding) and pay a monthly stipend to the researcher to support their work.

<b>Knowledgebase</b><br/><br/>To the best of my knowledge, there is no definitive public-facing curated collection of FoC-relevant history, projects, ideas, and resources. There is no FoC Wikipedia. There is no FoC ACM. There is no FoC <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu">SEP</a>. There is no dictionary of FoC. There is no Yellow Pages of FoC. No family tree of FoC. You get the idea.<br/><br/>Starting in January 2021, I'm going to lead a community initiative to build such a knowledgebase. I intend for it to be the go-to place to record, synthesize, and cite the things we discuss in this community. Like Wikipedia, there will be a mix of "open" pages editable by anyone, and "closed" pages run by select curators.<br/><br/>"Open" pages will be allow us all to collaborate on distilling our ideas. We do this already within the Slack, but the Slack (even with Mariano's newsletter and history search) is not a collaborative permanent record.<br/><br/>"Closed" pages will allow us to hire guest authors / curators to research and publish original works of anthropology for our field. As an example, we could commission a curation and reflection on important FoC work done by people from underrepresented backgrounds. (Said commission would almost certainly go to a person from such a background, natch.)

<b>FoC Podcast Miniseries</b><br/><br/>I'd like to produce a 99pi / Radiolab-esq miniseries of podcasts exploring major subjects within the FoC sphere. These podcasts would be made for a tech-savvy audience (perhaps at the level of Quanta Magazine), but one that is unfamiliar with our field and the major themes of our work. The goals would be to expand the audience for our work, encourage more people to work in this area, and share the fascinating things that we've discovered. Funding would be used to compensate me and anyone else who contributed to the creation of this series.

<b>Demo Days, Conferences, Events</b><br/><br/>Our community is full of folks working separately, chipping away on their slice of our shared vision. Our members have participated in formal conferences and events like LIVE, IFPS / FARM, Strange Loop, PPIG, etc. We've put together some events of our own, too, though they've been only lightly organized and somewhat informal. With a bit of funding, we could afford to pay people to do the work of organizing and hosting larger, more frequent events, and perhaps even pay a fee for participants. This would give us the cause to polish up some of our research projects, distill out the most interesting details, and present them in a clear and appealing way to a wider audience.

Why not also funding projects/research about use of AI for for future of programming? Maybe part as the "<b>Directly Funding Research</b>" proposal. For AI used as an help for HCI in programming like new ways to interact with programming artifacts (like Dynamicland and co) or to help manage and help understand programming artifacts (like Codist Ai and co).

Another idea that bring back AI in the proposal. Funding projects/research for tools for thought that help explain/understand AI, i.e. explorable explanations etc. for AI. But might be a bit too specific for this proposal, though.

Thanks for the replies everyone.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mariano Guerra</span> — Thank you for the suggestion! Forgive me, I'm going to critique it &lt;3. We <a href="../thinking-together/1595355834.085400.html">discussed</a> that idea quite a bit when <a href="http://Repl.it">Repl.it</a> announced their langjam. It'd take a lot of incentive design work, and thinking about what would create the most supportive environment, to pull off a contest that, on net, benefitted the community. It might not even be possible to do a contest that is equitable. I get that it creates motivation, but I'm not sure that motivation is what holds people back here. My hunch is that we'd ultimately end up with something similar to the <em>Directly Funding Research</em> idea, combined with the <em>Demo Days</em> idea. But if I'm maybe missing a benefit, let me know!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@nicolas decoster</span> — No reason folks here couldn't or shouldn't do those sorts of projects. Really, the point of this funding is to support the work that people here are already doing. If someone adapted their work to be more focussed on AI, I think that'd be great, but I haven't heard anything that suggests that that'd be <em>required</em>.<br/><br/>So yeah, too specific for this application. But if someone does start working on that stuff, I'd champion it as much as any project here, whether we get this grant or not.

One of the things we learned from our <a href="http://futureofcoding.org/episodes/046">2020 Community Survey</a> is that lots of folks come to this community without an FoC project of their own, but with an interest in working on a project led by someone else. I've even created a <a href="http://futureofcoding.org/collaboration">page on our website</a> to collect these sorts of projects (or contributors looking for projects). So anything we can do to make this happen <em>now</em>, independently of funding, we should do! If funding enters the picture, then this is just another permutation of the 1st idea I listed: <b>Directly Funding Research</b><br/><br/>Hackathons, specifically, slot into the 4th idea I listed: <b>Demo Days, Conferences, Events_._</b> But see also my reply to Mariano for some of the cautions about attaching money to these sorts of events. The theoretical $5k/month is enough to make a good prize, but it's not enough to meaningfully pay everyone equally all the time for their FoC work, so we need to be very strategic about when and why we choose to pay people here for their FoC work.

Thanks again everyone for the additional thoughts. They've helped me synthesize these ideas into my best "grant language". I'll attach the 4 draft write-ups I sent over to the team, so that if you're curious you can read them. <b> shrug </b><br/><br/>(Wishing I had another evening or two to work on these, but alas, I only get one. At the very least, I'm now in a great position to talk to the next person who offers us some funding!)

I was wondering.. are there projects within this community which are funded in some way? I myself receive a subsidy from our government in a form of tax deduction and I am going to request it again for 2021. Maybe its also good to talk about ways to fund our individual projects (whether its partially or wholly). I know that in the EU there exists funds for collaborations between companies in different countries.

Great job <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span>! As usual very clear, polish and well presented. I guess it is the best that could have been done in so less time. And reading all this future of our futurism is inspiring. :slightly_smiling_face: Hope this will do with this submission and, with or without this funding, it definitely shows a motivating path for the next of the community.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Maikel van de Lisdonk</span> — There are folks here who are doing FoC work at a startup (like Storyscript), or at existing company (like my work on Hest), so those forms of funding exist. But I don't know how many folks are in the situation you've described, where they receive government funding. I'd love to know more about how these EU funds work. I'm in Canada, and we have at various times had research funds, but the programs were not.. great, to say the least.

In a couple of weeks I have a session with my subsidy advisor who handles my request. I'll also bring up this topic, maybe there are some possibilities. Are there folks here that have there own company? I do actually, although its a one-person company (I work as a freelance developer focussing on frontend).

I do not know. I'm taking some time off at the end of the year, so in January I'll likely follow up with them. But I wouldn't be surprised if it were 6 months or longer before we knew the outcome.
