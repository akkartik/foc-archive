Howdy folks :wave: <br/>I’m Joe, and I stumbled onto this community via my work with Enso (which some of you may know as Luna language), thanks to Ivan and Mariano on twitter :smile: I work on community and education (docs etc) at enso, but have long been interested in programming language design and Haskell, which is how I came to meet the Enso folks. In the past I’ve spent a lot of time working on initiatives to help young folks, particularly students, learn to code, via Major League Hacking, and GitHub Education.
