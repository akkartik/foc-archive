You can play with it <a href="https://automerge-cards.surge.sh">here</a>. Desktop only. Drag from the top left to make an editable card. Type and arrow keys work, but that's it (it's a barebones text editor I wrote for a different project). Drag from the top right to make a sync server. You can edit the sync server text directly but that's broken, so don't. Cards/servers connect when they're close together. Cards are strictly client-server, but servers can be p2p and that usually works surprisingly well (all credit to Automerge). Green/red particles represent small changes, blue particles are a big bundle of changes that are sent when first connecting as an initial catch-up sync. You can grab particles with the mouse if you're fast, which is fun because it frustrates later particles — a particle only moves toward its target when all its dependencies are closer to their targets.<br/><br/>Don't bother looking at the code — I didn't write it (if you know what I mean), because the point of this project was just to get a visualization idea out of my head and see what it felt like, how well it fit with what Automerge actually does (turns out: not well), and mentally prep for an upcoming project.
