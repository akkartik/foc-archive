Hello friends,<br/><br/>My father was having some difficulty with Exercise 1.66 of Seven Sketches.  Thought you might get something out of my reply.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; Exercise 1.66. Let (P, ≤) be a preorder, and recall the notion of opposite preorder from Example 1.58.<br/><br/>Let's do this.  I'm under the weather today, so some easy proofs are just the thing.  We open up all the definitions, and the proofs fall out. Exercise 1.66 is really great, a Monument Valley of Mathematics.  The concepts are deep.  The proofs are simple.  (I have adjusted notation in your quoted bits.)<br/><br/>Start with the basics.  The preorder (P, ≤) is a set P and relation ≤ that is<br/>	<br/>	reflexive: p ≤ p for all p ∈ P, and<br/>	transitive: if p ≤ q and q ≤ r then p ≤ r for p, q, r ∈ P.<br/><br/>The opposite preorder op(P) := (P, ≥) flips the order of arguments so p ≥ q if q ≤ p. — Isn't ≥ the most obvious symbol?<br/><br/>Notice that the ≤ of (P, ≤) is implicit in op(P).  Math texts like their implicitness.  There <b>is</b> a regularity to it; however, it can be disorienting if you aren't following along perfectly.  The alternative explicitness would likely overwhelm with details.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; 1. Show that the set ↑(p) := {p' ∈ P | p ≤ p'} is an upper set, for any p ∈ P.<br/><br/>So ↑(p) is the set of all things bigger than p.  (Non-strictly of course because saying "at least as big as" sounds terrible.)<br/><br/>What's an upper set?<br/><br/>	For a preorder (P, ≤) an upper set in P is a subset U of P such that if p ∈ U and p ≤ q, then q ∈ U.<br/><br/>In other words, an upper set is part of the top of P.  So (1) is trivial.  ↑(p) is exactly the part of the top of P with p at the bottom and nothing else hanging on the sides.  Let's unwind the definitions to do this formally.<br/><br/>Consider q ∈ ↑(p).  This means p ≤ q.  Take r where q ≤ r.  By transitivity p ≤ r.  This means r ∈ ↑(p).<br/><br/>This sort of rhythm makes a logician happy.  What makes a mathematician happy?  Considering the converse.  Is every upper set ↑(p) for some p?<br/><br/>No!  We only need two elements {a, b} for a counterexample where a and b are incomparable – neither a ≤ b nor b ≤ a.  Generalize?  Whenever p and q are incomparable, ↑(p) ∪ ↑(q) will be an upper set, but there won't be an r such that ↑(r) = ↑(p) ∪ ↑(q).<br/><br/>Maybe we could extend the definition of ↑ to sets.  We would want ↑({p, q}) = ↑(p) ∪ ↑(q).  So for any set S, let ↑(S) := {p ∈ P | s ≤ p for some s ∈ S}.  This gives us a neat little way to characterize upper sets.  U is an upper set if and only if ↑(U) = U.  Nice, natural.  An upper set is one closed under ↑.<br/><br/>Another path of inquiry... given p and q, could there sometimes be a special, best r, such that both p, q ∈ ↑(r)?  What qualities would this best r have?  Well if p ∈ ↑(q), then r should be equivalent to q.  Moreover for some s if both p, q ∈ ↑(s), then s ∈ ↑(r).  Turns our there's a name for this kind of r, it's the meet of {p, q}.  So you should read Section 1.3.<br/><br/>One more idea... What happens when we take a totally ordered set, one in which every two elements are comparable.  Then is every upper set ↑(p) for some p?<br/><br/>No!  Consider (ℕ, ≥).  All of ℕ is certainly an upper set, but ↑(n) never catches all of ℕ not for any n ∈ ℕ.  How about we extend ℕ with this limit point ω &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number&gt;!  Or try this: start with the rational numbers, fill them in somehow &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut&gt;.  Generalizing to preorders, we eventually discover Galois connections &lt;https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/MacNeille+completion&gt;.  Read Section 1.4.<br/><br/>I told you this book knows what it's doing.
