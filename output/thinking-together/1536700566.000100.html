Thanks! Maybe I should make it clearer on my blog then! It could be most succinctly summarised as iterating "use a simple system to improve and add features to itself". I know the term originally from compilers, where it has something to do with implementing self-hosting compilers, but I can't remember the exact details. I trace all my enthusiasm to VPRI's Open, Reusable Object Models paper (<a href="http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2006003a_objmod.pdf">http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2006003a_objmod.pdf</a>) and the related stuff on COLAs (<a href="http://piumarta.com/software/cola/">http://piumarta.com/software/cola/</a>).<br/><br/>&gt;We show that three object types and five methods are sufficient to bootstrap an extensible object model ["Id"] and messaging semantics that are described entirely in terms of those same objects and messages.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dan Cook</span> has done an excellent job explaining what I would say is the <b>end result</b> of "bootstrapping" on the forum he uses (see <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=270092#270092">https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=270092#270092</a> and many other posts there). When <b>I</b> talk about bootstrapping I'm usually emphasising the process of <b>getting</b> to a point like that, i.e. what needs to be done <b>outside</b> of the system, to build enough of it that you can then do everything else you want <b>inside</b> instead.<br/><br/>The Id system is ostensibly an example of such rich, introspective systems. So is Squeak. But both of these, like everything else, require typing lots of text in a text editor, and writing parsers, to get off the ground, to be bootstrapped. I do not like this, especially since nowadays we type on the keyboard and <b>pixels</b> light up, not ink on teletype-paper. I reckon that there ought to be a way to create graphical computing environments that are as introspective as Smalltalk or Id from a small graphical core, in the same way those two environments living and breathing "text" and "programming languages" were developed using text and programming languages. I want to combine the best of that OROM paper and the best of Bret Victor, and explore what the latter has hinted at, namely ways of specifying computable functions without describing them in a language. To do something like Id, but using shapes <b>other</b> than monospaced glyphs. Since the environment I have to start with is text-code in an editor, the idea is to write the "minimal" amount of such code that will let me comfortably develop the system using input and visual feedback to/from the system, instead of my OS.<br/><br/>The process of using a system to improve itself is familiar to us all, because this is what software is, taken as a whole. We create software using more software. The hazy dream is that this should be done all the way down. I am kinda biased for maximal self-modifiability to the point of being automatically uninterested in anything that doesn't have that property - criticism welcome. I'd argue as Dan Cook does in the linked post:<br/><br/>&gt;even if you could discover the "perfect" language or interface or whatever for everything, it would still be locked-down to working a certain way, and the programmer or user would be constrained to whatever fixed set of tools &amp; operations that it provides -- and thus the situation remains fundamentally unchanged.<br/><br/>Er ... I have written a lot of words, but have they helped?

I was <em>just</em> struggling with this "bootstrapping" issue last night. This is perfectly timed. Thanks for the links.

Cool! What was the nature of your struggle? Do you mean you were wondering what bootstrapping is, or that you've been doing it without knowing it was called that, etc...

Haha, sorry, I used those "scare quotes" a bit vaguely. My project is taking the Clojure approach, where you design a new language to sit atop another <em>host language</em>, and make some aspects of the host available in your language. The project (a visual PL) is designed to let you create layered visual DSLs, and it'll run atop various JS contexts (Electron &amp; browser), so I am feeling some tension around the question of... what should be in the core runtime that sits directly atop JS, versus what should be implemented in the first visual DSL level? Sort of like the questions that come up when bootstrapping: what minimal primitives do you need/want in order to go metacircular and start compiling your own compiler and/or implementing things in terms of themselves? I haven't found much in the way of good discussion about this matter, outside the realm of Lisp. I wasn't aware that VPRI had tackled the subject, and I haven't seen that paper about Open, Extensible Object Models, so this should help me explore the topic and crystallize my thinking.

There are a lot of factors that might drive me to push things up into the first-level visual language, or down into the core runtime. For instance, there might be a perf benefit to something being in core. Or, there might be a design benefit to putting something in the VPL, if that forces me to make the VPL more expressive/powerful in order to accommodate it. I can always change my mind later on and move things up and down as the cause arises. But I've just been struggling to figure out how to arrange things at first. In any case, reading your links and blog should give me the <em>modelling</em> jolt I need.

Yep, that is <b>the</b> hard question. You want the outside work to be as small as possible, yet you also want the initial built system to be actually usable for self-development in a way that doesn't keep sending you back to your text editor -- as I have experience every time I've tried so far :slightly_smiling_face: But that link looks like it can help, cheers Shalabh.
