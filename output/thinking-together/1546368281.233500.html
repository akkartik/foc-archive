Hi all - I hope you have had a relaxing holiday season. I'm posting to remind everyone of the upcoming Salon des Refus√©s 2019 Call for Papers which you can read at <a href="https://www.shift-society.org/salon/call-for-papers/">https://www.shift-society.org/salon/call-for-papers/</a> . This is a pretty new venue for paradigm-busting new approaches to programming - check out some of the interesting contributions we've received in our first two years. There are lots of folk here who have posted thought-provoking and counterfactual views on how we need to reframe the task of programming so I feel sure we could get many great contributions and start some great conversations. In general we would be far more interested in some unpolished, rough work that is much more challenging to the status quo than some more well-worked out and mature work that is less disruptive - save that for other venues. A word to the wise - although the official deadline is next week a rumour on the grapevine suggests that this will end up being extended a couple of weeks : P - so don't shy away because you think there's too little time to get your ideas down. Looking forward to hearing what you are thinking about!
