I often like to use music production or video editing as examples — domains with lots of complexity and powerful tools that don’t require programming skills (but a lot of domain knowledge). Somehow we haven’t figured out how to do that for our own domain yet.\nMaybe that’s a sign that we always need a specific domain. I don’t think so, but it’s a valid argument and obviously not proven.\n\nI like to think spreadsheets are a counter argument to that, looking at all the strange ways non-programmers have found to make them work for their use cases."
