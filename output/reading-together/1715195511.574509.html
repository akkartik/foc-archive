^I finished the book a while back and just got around to jotting down <a href="https://www.petemillspaugh.com/a-small-matter-of-programming">some wandering notes</a>.<br/><br/>Would anyone be interested in doing a zoom book club discussion? Slack threads per chapter are nice for participation across time zones, but I prefer the format of reading then chatting about the whole book in one sitting

Having a deadline is also good motivation (for me at least) to read the book. We could do a book+meeting every 2 months maybe

I’m sorry I fell off track, I’d love to finish it though and join this. Are there any chapters in particular that you think are a must read or could be skipped?

My biased answer to your question re must-read/skip (tldr - I enjoyed the first half more than the second half):<br/><br/><b>Chapter 1</b> :+1: <br/>• Must-read because it sets the stage for the whole book<br/><b>Chapter 2</b> :+1: :thinking_face:<br/>• Interesting chapter — reads very current (LLMs)<br/><b>Chapter 3</b> :+1: :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>• I thought the beginning of chapter 3 was fascinating as a casual baseball fan<br/>• I also appreciated the spreadsheet analysis as someone who used to spend most of my workday in Excel<br/><b>Chapter 4</b> :+1:<br/>• Feels a bit outdated, but I liked thinking about modern examples of the different end-user programming approaches as I read it<br/><b>Chapter 5</b> :man-shrugging: <br/>• I'm not super into visual programming (scared to admit that here lol), but worth reading if you are<br/><b>Chapter 6</b> :man-shrugging: <br/>• Similar take as chapter 5. If you're particularly interested in collaborative multi-player software it'd be more worthwhile<br/><b>Chapter 7</b> :man-shrugging: <br/>• Examples felt outdated, but it's short and wraps up the book<br/>All that said, the book isn't long, so you could just skim through the parts that don't grab you. Sorry for taking so long to respond here!

I just finished ch4 but meanwhile wanted to bring up a conundrum from ch3.<br/><br/>> It seems that the only way to know how specific a set of program constructs should be is to study the domain very carefully to ascertain how tasks are broken down and performed. A guiding principle is that users will want to be able to create their applications with only a few basic operations, as the experience of UNIX users (Greenberg and Witten, 1988), spreadsheet users (Nardi and Miller, 1990) and CAD users (Tee, 1992) shows.<br/><br/>1. You have to provide primitives that are high-level enough to correspond to concepts & tasks users have.<br/>2. Users want to learn & use <em>few</em> primitives.  Sometimes they are happier with lower level yet more composable primitives.<br/>3. Striking a good balance requires interviewing users a lot - which requires not just programmer skills but sociology skills (how to interview, "activity theory", etc.)<br/> :worried: <br/><br/>• The book hopes for advances on the last point (3). So, has there been?  Are there simple & proven interview techniques? "ask these questions and you'll design a good EUP system" :ballot_box_with_check: ?<br/>• Frame challenge: are there ways for users themselves to design for their domain :thinking_face:?<br/>• Challenge on <em>few</em> requirement (2): were there advances on giving users both composite & lower-level primitives so they can inspect the relation ("A flange, for example, can be created out of a cut and a protrusion") and pick for themselves - something users do anyway - without overwhelming them :face_with_head_bandage: ?
