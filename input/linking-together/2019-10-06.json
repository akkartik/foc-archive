            "text": "Okay folks, i just spent the weekend coding a version of little kid's Lumberjack game that was programmed in React\/Typescript (playable game at <https:\/\/lumber-jack.netlify.com\/>).  I did a high-fidelity clone of the React version in my Beads language, and published the results.  The Beads version is here on GitHub (<https:\/\/github.com\/magicmouse\/beads-examples\/tree\/master\/Example%20-%20Lumberjack>).  Although the source code is comparable, the redu√ßtion in the number of source files from 13 to 1 is favorable, and the reduction of external API's referenced directly or indirectly from 1300 to 13 is 100:1 reduction in terms of dependencies. A big part of the problem with programming especially in the JS world is the horrible tangled web of interdependencies, which makes interchangeable parts impossible in the JS\/framework space IMHO.\n\nIf you have your own favorite language, why not try making the game yourself, the original React version has all the art and sound effect assets you would need already created. And if there are any lurkers on this group that would like to try Beads out please message me.",

Although the source code is comparable, the redu√ßtion in the number of source files from 13 to 1 is favorable, and the reduction of external API's referenced directly or indirectly from 1300 to 13 is 100:1 reduction in terms of dependencies. A big part of the problem with programming especially in the JS world is the horrible tangled web of interdependencies, which makes interchangeable parts impossible in the JS\/framework space IMHO.\n\nIf you have your own favorite language, why not try making the game yourself, the original React version has all the art and sound effect assets you would need already created. And if there are any lurkers on this group that would like to try Beads out please message me."
