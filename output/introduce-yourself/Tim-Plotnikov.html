Hello everyone :wave:<br/>My name is Tim and I’ve found this community through the Future of coding podcast, episode about relational algebra. <br/><br/>I was always interested in such things like frame-based editing, new ways to program a computer, etc. And I couldn’t imagine that there is a community who also explore “future of coding” :grin:<br/>I’m really excited to be here! <br/><br/>Now I’m exploring the idea to apply relational model to managing state in mobile applications. The main goal is to make mobile app development easier, less error prone and reduce amount of code that mobile developers usually write. <br/><br/>I’m not sure why, but currently mobile applications usually contain SO much code and accidentall complexity that it blows my mind. An app for mobile phone can easily grow to millions of lines of code for moderate functionality and I’m believe we can do better.<br/><br/>I’ve started with Rich Hickey’s talks and “Out of the tar pit” paper and we’ll see where I can get with it.
