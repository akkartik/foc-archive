O Ive been waiting for that to come out since they shut the last one down. They will def have it in LogicApps... There are already API connectors for image processing. Haven't tried using them but it's probably the lowest friction way to get some image processing in a buisness process. I.e. check if the image is a receipt, if so send to this email or something along those lines.
