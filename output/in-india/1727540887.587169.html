Oh a little late but this is the small app built during the session using the Remix Studio node/wire editor. Couldn't quite finish it during the 3 minute lighting demo :joy: but here it is as intended. It is a little tool to say, "Hi I'm here", or "I'm raising my hand":<br/><a href="https://remix.app/event/focjam">https://remix.app/event/focjam</a><br/>(ps: It should load as a native app clip if you're on iOS, I'm not, so I can neither confirm nor deny...)<br/><br/>The structure:<br/>• the runtime is housed in a webcomponent, and can run on web, in an appclip, in our native app, or as an embed anywhere you can stick a webcomponent<br/>• the "app" is a .remix executable, packaged from the visual code you saw in the demo<br/>• the interactions are brokered via a cloud service hosting agents (ok, API endpoints) also built visually and installed on cloud via a .remix file<br/>• Liveness comes from server sent events, a native primitive in our visual programming language<br/>Will share a build video separately on #share-your-work

ps: I'll keep tweaking the "app" by and by, so if you guys have any small, interesting feature requests that would make this a useful but unobtrusive tool at FoC jams, just DM me :slightly_smiling_face:
