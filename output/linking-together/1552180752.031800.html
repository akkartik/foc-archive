Groups of humans are on some level still just troops of hominids on the savannah. There are many ways to not fit in, and the penalty for not fitting in is the same (being cast out), and the group doesn't really have good self-awareness of where the misfit lay. And why does it have to be <em>you</em> that needs to change and needs feedback?<br/><br/>The good news is that there's one major way we <em>aren't</em> like hominids on the savannah: there are lots of groups out there, in dazzling varieties. Just forget the experience, stop trying to learn from it, find another group to join.<br/><br/>(And another, and another, and another. Some people have a better fit with the larger population than others. But the strategy doesn't change. Try to forget the past, and treat each new group as the first.)
