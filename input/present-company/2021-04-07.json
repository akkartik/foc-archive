Also, I'm not aware of any database which has sufficiently advanced access control mechanisms to fully implement the kinds of access controls that we have\/require (not just ACLs, but also limits, structuring, AML, KYC, sanctions, risk exposure, maker\/checker, compliance document expiry, etc.) We store all of these rules in the blockchain as well, so that they are as tamper resistant as the transactions themselves. When crypto-exchanges are broken into, it is never the crypto that is broken, but instead the surrounding infrastructure and meta-data, but we store everything in the blockchain, which helps to avoid that problem.",

In our system the audit logs are the database, so it isn't possible for the database and the audit log to get out of sync. Audit logs help figure out what happened after the fact, but often, that may be too late. Also, I'm not aware of any database which has sufficiently advanced access control mechanisms to fully implement the kinds of access controls that we have\/require (not just ACLs, but also limits, structuring, AML, KYC, sanctions, risk exposure, maker\/checker, compliance document expiry, etc.) We store all of these rules in the blockchain as well, so that they are as tamper resistant as the transactions themselves. When crypto-exchanges are broken into, it is never the crypto that is broken, but instead the surrounding infrastructure and meta-data, but we store everything in the blockchain, which helps to avoid that problem."
