        "text": "Hey <@UCUSW7WVD>, I finally got to read your two published blog posts about mu. They were very useful to learn about what you are working on and also to understand your values. I like your focus on simplicity. Or maybe it's minimalism?\n\nI couldn’t help but think of MLIR (<https:\/\/github.com\/tensorflow\/mlir#mlir-talks>), which seems strangely similar and different at the same time. You have very specific ideas about each of the three layers you propose. MLIR is obviously much more complex because its goals are different (e.g. optimization), but it is also fundamentally about layers between the machine and a high-level language. And it’s about multiple layers (which is how it differs from LLVM).\n\nMu also reminds me of <http:\/\/scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu\/11-ghuloum.pdf>. Again layers, here much more granular than what you’re up to.\n\nI have also been fascinated by the idea of “cleaning up” the stack, remove all the cruft we don’t really need anymore, and design a more sleek and minimal base system that a single individual can comprehend completely. Much like in the spirit of Alan Kay's VPRI STEPS project.\n\nA friend of mine is working on an interesting project that is also in a way related, however focusing on the past to remove complexity: <https:\/\/www.pagetable.com\/?p=1373>\n\nIt's tough for a single individual to build the whole stack, especially for today's hardware, even if you figure out an infrastructure that will save you so much time and effort to build things on — the figuring out part is what takes so long.\n\nBut if you can’t build the whole thing, then it's difficult to decide on which side of the spectrum to start. You (as many others) chose the low-level, bare metal side, and build it up from there. For sure that has potential to make these lower levels so much more effective. But it's a long way to get to a level that application programmers or even “end-users” will want to touch at all.\n\nIf you start on the other end, you can build pretty much anything on any hardware and focus on interaction, but you buy that flexibility with dependencies. And I haven’t seen many projects starting on that side tackling the dependency issue by methodically working on removing or replacing such dependencies. That could be a sign that figuring out the interaction is hard enough to never get to the cleaning up dependencies part, but frankly I think many developers are fine with the dependencies and probably don’t think about it too much. The web is often a good platform choice where you can make yourself feel better about dependencies “because they are (based on) open standards”. This never really worked for me (and clearly that's my problem, not the web's), but I doubt we get to a great place by piling onto a massive stack that gets more and more difficult to understand and maintain.\n\nAh, well, not sure where I was going with this… I enjoyed reading your blog posts and they made me think about this. So here you go. Not sure if that’s really useful feedback.",
