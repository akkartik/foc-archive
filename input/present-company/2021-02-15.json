I did bristle at \"GUI-laden Macintosh\", though. That felt unfair to me. The Mac I type this on is thin _and_ light. Whatever weight is added due to the presence of the GUI is hardly noticeable.

That said, I'm going to talk about programming, because that's an argument I can win. If there was any flaw with the original Macintosh (which there wasn't, but just go with me here) it's that the only visual programming environment for it was released 3 years late. And even then, that environment wasn't truly \"_visual_ programming\", as the included art tools were entirely separate from the programming tools. At best, you could call it \"hypermedia programming\", as you had to work very quickly to be able to do the job of both an artist and a programmer. And there we see the true advantage of visual programming — by programming entirely with one's art skill, you do not need to waste time developing full thoughts, as you do with writing. With a simple sketch, you can reconfigure your web browser to... do other things. Wow, writing is tedious. Here, let me finish the thought more appropriately: ✂︎⚗︎︎🃍▼. Simple!\n\nBut rather than concerning ourselves with the worst instances, let us compare only the best. We've seen a text operating system created by thoughtful writers (UNIX), and a visual operating system created by thoughtful artists (Macintosh). We've seen a text programming system created by thoughtful writers (Tcl). We truly have not yet seen a visual programming system created by thoughtful artists.\n\nSo _nobody_ is allowed to say visual programming is worse than textual programming, because as I've just proven — in _your_ domain, using words (bleh) — visual programming doesn't exist yet.",

Surely, the glass in my laptop's trackpad weighs less than the full-travel clicky keyboard and CRT required by your portable UNIX terminal of choice.\n\nLet's all bear in mind that what is being compared here is text vs visual in the context of operating systems, not in the context of programming, which are not the same thing at all. That said, I'm going to talk about programming, because that's an argument I can win. If there was any flaw with the original Macintosh (which there wasn't, but just go with me here) it's that the only visual programming environment for it was released 3 years late. And even then, that environment wasn't truly \""

At best, you could call it \"hypermedia programming\", as you had to work very quickly to be able to do the job of both an artist and a programmer. And there we see the true advantage of visual programming — by programming entirely with one's art skill, you do not need to waste time developing full thoughts, as you do with writing. With a simple sketch, you can reconfigure your web browser to... do other things. Wow, writing is tedious. Here, let me finish the thought more appropriately: ✂︎⚗︎︎🃍▼. Simple!\n\nBut rather than concerning ourselves with the worst instances, let us compare only the best. We've seen a text operating system created by thoughtful writers (UNIX), and a visual operating system created by thoughtful artists (Macintosh). We've seen a text programming system created by thoughtful writers (Tcl). We truly have not yet seen a visual programming system created by thoughtful artists.\n\nSo "
