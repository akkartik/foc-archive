I also want to take the chance to post some FoC-related communities in the Philadelphia area:<br/>• <a href="https://iffybooks.net/">Iffy Books: hacking, free culture, gardening, zines</a>. So thankful for this community, their monthly <a href="https://iffybooks.net/event/permacomputing-nov-12/">Permacomputing Meetup</a> is a great event too.<br/>• <a href="https://phillycommunitywireless.org/">Philly Community Wireless: Building community-controlled net&hellip;</a>. Community-run infrastructure opens computing possibilities which are not possible under more traditional ISPs. The team behind PCW is also wonderful :heart: <br/>• <a href="https://phillyjs.com/">Philly JS Club: a place for developers of all skill and expe&hellip;</a> Haven't personally been to a hack night yet but it seems like a good time.<br/>This is just a start, please reply in thread with any additional communities! It would be cool to have a living archive of Philly ~FoC communities in this channel.
