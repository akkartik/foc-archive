I've made a new node type which converts a json flow to webassembly memory so that it can be used to generate a 3d view of the flow. This approach serves multiple purposes.. since I am dogfooding my own editor, I use my own feedback to hopefully improve it and the custom programming language. Another goal is to build a webgl node and wire editor which has the least amount of dependencies (hopefully only javascript and webassembly manipulating the dom and webgl without the help of libraries). It will be a great learning experience for sure (whether I succeed or not). Hopefully I can show some screenshots later this week\/next weekend of the progress.",
