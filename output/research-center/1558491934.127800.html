The Corporate Model:<br/>Incorporate the Future Of Coding Institute (FOCI) as a non-profit. The board of directors is responsible for corporate governance. The Research Advisory Council would include luminaries such as Alan Kay and Bret Victor, and would set the overall research directions for the Institute. There will be paid administrative staff, at minimum an executive director. FOCI will be located in a livable city with a significant tech industry, where there are opportunities for attracting talent, and for attracting funding: endowments from tech billionaires, financial support from the local tech industry business council, matching funds from multiple tiers of government. You get funding by providing economic and non-economic benefits to the local community. So FOCI does things. FOCI has a research staff, does research and publishes results (research papers, git repositories). It builds experimental coding tech and does empirical usability testing in a coding lab, with volunteers from the local community. It hosts seminars and conferences. It might run a public outreach program with public lectures aimed at the local tech community. Maybe there is also an educational program. I live in Kitchener/Waterloo, which has all of these resources, and there are a growing number of independent local research institutes that follow this model. So I know that in principle it can be done, if you know how and have the connections.<br/><br/>PROS: pretty sweet if you can pull it off. An independent research institute is a more sensible model for supporting ongoing basic research than a tech startup or a kickstarter campaign, which is expected to produce a usable product within a limited amount of time (after which the organization runs out of money and dies). CONS: a lot of work to get started.<br/><br/>The DIY/Independent Model:<br/>A group of passionate individuals gets together, pools their resources, and you just do it, using whatever means are at your disposal to make something happen. I've been involved with a number of organizations that follow this DIY model,. My local orgs have included a makerspace (with a rented building), and an organization focused on digital literacy and STEAM programming for children and youth. Plus I run an open source research project on github and I'm on this forum. The Future of Coding organization, with its forum and branches in multiple cities, looks like a good starting point.<br/><br/>PROS: lower startup costs. CONS: volunteer burnout.<br/><br/>In the comments, you might mention groups or organizations or even "scenes" that you consider a good model for advancing the goals of the proposed research centre.

A suggestion : starting with the independent model then scale up to a non-profit institute.

<tt>FOCI will be located in a livable city with a significant tech industry, where there are opportunities for attracting talent<br/>There's nothing wrong with that but this sounds like a standard research center and I'm not proposing that.  The reason that the equivalent in art, an artists colony, would always be remote is because it was proportional to how removed from the state of the current art they wanted to be.  Gaugin and Van Gogh, for example, insisted on moving out of Paris to get away from the current scene to start a new one.  The future of coding, in my opinion, will stem from fundamental changes to foundational concepts.  The question of, "What can we build if we throw it all away," is not one that would ever be answered in San Francisco.

The reason I described the "standard research centre" model is to get it on the table for discussion, and also because there is a well understood process for getting funding for such a beast. But I absolutely do want to discuss other models as well.

&gt; The question of, "What can we build if we throw it all away," is not one that would ever be answered in San Francisco.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I believe this. Doug Englebart's NLS project, and the Smalltalk project, both came out of the Bay area. SF has plenty of counter-cultural organizations that challenge consensus reality, such as The Long Now Foundation, and the NoiseBridge makerspace, and the Burning Man Project. The concentration of talented and creative people probably means it is still a great scene, even today.<br/><br/>What concerns me about San Francisco today is that it's too expensive. I'm thinking about the price I would have to pay to finance my own residency at a DIY FOC retreat. For the DIY approach, I think the benefit of the remote artist's colony model is cheap real estate.

&gt; The future of coding, in my opinion, will stem from fundamental changes to foundational concepts.<br/><br/>I agree. I'm not interested in pursuing my research from within an academic setting, or as a "20% project" as a Google employee, I see that as too constraining.<br/><br/>However, a "standard" independent research centre is definitely capable of supporting this kind of research. At home, my favourite research centre is the Perimeter Institute. They are lavishly funded, and yet they also have research teams whose job is to burn down physics and rebuild it according to new principles. They have done foundational research on Loop Quantum Gravity, which aims to replace General Relativity with a new theory compatible with Quantum Mechanics. The latest public talk I attended by was by Faculty member Lee Smolin, talking about his project to burn down Quantum Mechanics, replacing or deleting one of the fundamental axioms so that the new theory can be consistent with realism (that the universe exists independent of human observers). They can do this kind of research because they aren't subject to the normal academic constraints of applying for grants from academic funding agencies. All of the filtering of what is and isn't acceptable research is done by people inside the Institute, not by external agencies.<br/><br/>I think the real problem with this idea is finding people with the skills to get it off the ground.
