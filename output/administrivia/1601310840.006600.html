I've noticed a bit of uncertainty about what belongs in #announcements. We've also had a higher volume of posts there than I'd like, so far. My hope is that the channel will be so low-volume that folks who only log in once every few months would find it worthwhile to catch up on all the posts there that they missed.<br/><br/>How would you all feel about changing the rules around that channel a bit? I was thinking something like: <em>If you'd like to share something to #announcements, please DM it to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> for approval.</em> Additionally, we could make it so that I'm the only one who actually posts to that channel, which might help indicate to people "Don't post here — get Ivan to post here for you". / shrug /<br/><br/>My thinking is that that channel should mainly be for stuff that everyone <em>needs</em> to see — eg, if we update the code of conduct, or if we add additional moderators, or if something changes about the nature of the community. Job offers and conference calls for submissions and such.. that feels like a grey area — not sure what to do with them; they probably belong in #linking-together or #share-your-work. But posts about croudfunding, or new initiatives by members of the community, or other things that are happening <em>within</em> the community (but not <em>about</em> the community itself), absolutely ought to go in #share-your-work or #linking-together or #thinking-together or #present-company, as appropriate.<br/><br/>Nods of agreement? Grunts of disapproval? Epic poems of alternative proposals?

"Announcements" feels like an admin-post-only channel, and mostly about FoC<br/><br/>(has been that way in most of the other slack communities I participate in)<br/><br/>Agreed that most regular-folk announcements just go in one of the usual channels
