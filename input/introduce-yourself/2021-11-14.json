I'm working on a *new vision for the terminal* - one that uses plain english.\n\nTo that end, I've been building <https:\/\/rosieos.com|Rosie> for the past few weeks, and a friend mentioned I come here. It's still really new, but it's a step forward. If you've ever spent 15 minutes crawling StackOverflow to figure out some specific CLI command, then Rosie is for you. Just type in plain english what you'd like to do, and Rosie will give you the CLI command.\n\nMore importantly, in the <https:\/\/fofcudps6xn.typeform.com\/to\/QHgIC8bF|desktop app>, Rosie will actually run the command. Coupled with a revamped file explorer (think Superhuman, but Finder), I think we can really change this archaic part of coding.\n\nI hope you guys like it! Excited to be part of this community.",
