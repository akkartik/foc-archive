It's a big Papers We Love: Education edition tomorrow! Weâ€™re being joined by Jane Waite, researcher at the Raspberry Pi foundation, to talk about her report (co-authored with Sue Sentence) that summarises the research around programming pedagogy, drawing on 170 papers. All the info here: <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/edu/discussions/5">https://github.com/papers-we-love/edu/discussions/5</a>

This report is a very accessible place to start chewing into what the research has to say about teaching and learning programming. I've really enjoyed using it as a gateway with colleagues who are involved in communicating programming concepts in various ways but haven't formally trained in pedagogy
