I'm interested in your driving principles for the work you do in the future of programming\/coding.\n\nFor example, \"state and i\/o are bad\/good\", \"text is bad\/good\", \"always allow explorable explanations\", \"programmer must always see the data changing when the code changes\", \"anything else Bret Victor thinks\", \"don't allow syntax errors\", \"programming is about modelling the world\", \"it's time to break the programmer|corporate|etc priesthood!!\", \"declarative not imperative\", \"eliminate accidental complexity\", \"flappy bird in 10 lines\"..\n\nWhat are the fundamental principles you always look to (and have always held to, looking back) when making any technical or design decision, even if only subconsciously?"

If we’re the craftsman, the computer is the apprentice and is here to do the mundane tasks and hand us the tools we need when we need them.\nWe don’t need better languages - we need better tools. We need an apprentice that’s going to put the mundane boilerplate behind us.\n\nA lot of boilerplate and complexity in software development exists because different worlds collide in a single project - different kinds of developers and designers, each creating their own little universes with their own little stacks and models and processes and standards. Then you add a project manager to connect all those little universes, smashing them together into one and hoping for the best. I believe we should be doing it differently - one universe from the ground up.\n\nI believe programming is about expressing ideas and creating universes, and to create a universe for our idea we first must shape the data we want to use, so in a sense it is about modelling a world - you’re setting the laws, boundaries, basic elements of a whole new universe. Sometimes, you model it according to ours and copy over models and abstractions of how things work here.

Sometimes, you take the power to create from nothing and build the ideal world and then it’s all up to you and your creativity to come up with a solution.\n\n\nSo when I’d have to compile it to some fundamental principles, I’d go with:\n• Model the basic universe structures, then interactions between them\n• Treat state as an emergent property and recognize it as such, allowing you not to think of it as bad or good but noticing it and managing it.\n• Write minimal code - template stuff, standardise stuff in your team, use those standards to write small tools, use those tools to generate code. You work _with_ the computer, use the code at your disposal and cut the mundane boilerplate. The boilerplate is where mistakes happen (including human communication when something could be automated).\n• Be the laziest you can be when designing both developer and user interfaces. Less typing is more productivity.\n• Don’t let ego effect your code. By that I don’t mean the “this is the best way to make it and that’s it”, by that I also mean “i’ll stick with the known because I’m afraid to dive into unknown”. Keep it balanced. Explore, sketch, rough out the idea, the compare. You can always revert here, there is no fucking up while you’re exploring.\n• Assist the user in making decisions, but don’t do it for them. \n• Keep your code structures tree-like. Meaning from the root, it’s easy to see it’s first\/second level depth children and interactions between them. Their children’s children should be implementation details and you should dive into them only when needed. If you can’t find “root”, look at the code as a dependency graph and you’ll see that it emerges anyways as an interlink of dependencies and interactions.\n• Everything can be configured and is configurable by the user. Everything. \n• The samurai technique - minimal movement, maximum effectiveness.",

There are two fundermental apporach to setting the law:\n1. Own the data, make every write through you. This is called 'Entity'. So that data must have identity.\n2. Make the data portable, along with its rules. This is called 'Value Object'. \nMost of time, Entity is the only way to enforce the contract. Making \"master data\" partitioned and ownership clear is essential and hard. Delegating reponsibility to manage the data to carry out the logic is an art.",

I think this can mean things like making all of the settings configurable, but providing sane defaults. But it can also mean building your app as a composition of pieces in a framework that the user can rewire. Or it can mean building abstractions in code in such a way that they provide value, but can still be decomposed and recombined in ways you didn’t have to account for\/expect. Or maybe I’m just reading all of this into it. But it all seems like the same thing to me."
