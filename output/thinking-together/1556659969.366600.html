Good point. I would think of that as “underspecification” (not sure if there’s another term of art). Agreed that it’s a large source of errors, particularly in big systems where putting together many underspecified parts results in crazy regions of undefined behavior.<br/><br/>I still think it’s a little different than a composable system where the semantics are fully/unambiguously specified, e.g. a programming language with formal operational semantics, but where it can be hard to predict a class of programs someone might be able to write. But both are dangerous in their own right.
