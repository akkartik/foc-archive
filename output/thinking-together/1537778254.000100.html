Hey all, I'm having serious doubts about continuing in my job and because this community is essentially what I want to do for a living, please allow me to seek your advice. Sorry if the following suffers from flaws of tone or content, but better out than in.<br/><br/>The other day I was writing some JSON validation boilerplate and I became quite stressed wondering if I picked the wrong career. And I've only been doing it for one year! I feel like I am wasting my time and not making use of the skills I have. Working as a software engineer doesn’t seem to be about “solving interesting problems”, despite what the recruitment ads say, nor is it about having the creative power to make your own work easier via automation.<br/><br/>Initially I got the impression they wanted “clever people” for the knowledge and design/engineering skill they can bring to the table, but actually the reality is that I don’t get to make use of 90% of what I’ve learned elsewhere, instead I just do the digital equivalent of manual labour.<br/><br/>I deliberately under-perform so that the code I write and the ideas I contribute are compatible with the mindsets of my coworkers. I've been surprised at the overwhelming lack of interest among them in the aspect of programming that you do yourself, i.e. architectural principles / design patterns.<br/><br/>Before I entered the industry I had the impression that this sort of thing was useful knowledge to have, and that people would just have ... discussions. But there barely is any discussion about our own craft except for specific named projects <b>other</b> people have come up with, like recommendations for Python webservers, testing frameworks, etc.<br/><br/>I'm also discouraged by the fear that if I display too much interest in that sort of thing then somebody will call me an Architecture Astronaut, and link to some article Joel Spolsky once wrote, and I won't know what to say.<br/><br/>Because so much of what I want to talk about is new stuff that hasn't been long established or even fully thought through yet, I take an 'improv' attitude towards ideas -- meaning, if something is absurd and half-baked then that is an <b>opportunity</b> for conversation and development. But people around me seem to take that as the <b>end</b> of a conversation -- interpreting it as a worked-through, actionable proposal, which has problem X and Y that are up to me, the proposer, to fix (instead of collaboratively fix due to the idea sounding promising.) After this happened enough times I just learned not to bother trying to contribute or communicate in that way. And it's not necessarily their fault; to me it boils down to two different reactions to absurd or half-baked ideas -- exploration or dismissal, each with valid contexts of use. I'm not that confident in my verbal communication skills, but I do manage fine with other topics, so I'm not sure that's the issue here.<br/><br/>So, if anybody else with basic programming and google skills could do what I do, then why should I take their job while constantly fantasising about actually making use of what I learned at uni and elsewhere?<br/><br/>Maybe I belong in research, but I don’t know how that works. I don’t know if you get to pick what you research, or if you have to sell it as something that will deliver concrete results after X years. (Thinking about the STEPS project here)<br/><br/>I already try to spend my free time doing my sort of informal research, but I'm surprised at how unenthusiastic I feel about it after I come home from work, having spent much of the day suppressing daydreams about the exact same stuff. If this was not the case, then I could tolerate my job, but the fact that it's stealing my energy from something I feel is far more important, is too much.
