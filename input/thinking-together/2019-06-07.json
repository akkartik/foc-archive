Isn't it an accurate reflection of the universe we live in?\n\nThe problem with SMS seems to be that it allows for an explosion in possible execution paths that the programmer didn't anticipate. A more natural way to solve this problem might be to make the programmer more aware of what is actually happening, rather than limiting the use of SMS.\n\nI think this whole thing is a symptom of programming languages introducing parallelism *after* the \"read-lines-one-by-one-and-track-state-in-your-head\" paradigm of coding was already set in. If an IDE showed you a lockless function that mutates state, not as a clean one-by-one list of instructions, but as the bizarre tangle of spaghetti it actually is, people would avoid issues in a more natural way. Another way to think of this is two programmers sitting side by debugging the same function out loud...\n```programmer 1: Ok... if x is less than 5, set y to 3\nprogrammer 2: Ok... set y to -5, then if...\nprogrammer 1: Hey what are you doing? I want y to be 3\nprogrammer 2: No I just set it -5\n...```\nYeah, this is kind of chaotic but it's actually, in a way, very \"natural\" and \"easy to understand\". Not easy to *solve*, but very natural _to see that it's difficult to solve_.\n\nBasically I think that mutating global variables are actually the most natural way for a human to understand procedures, and supposedly \"clearer\" methods like FP are only popular among people with very strong mathematical ability, who have *also* already internalized powerful abstraction abilities that they no longer realize are unnatural, and have _also_ already experienced the difficulty of trying to understand parallelism with only their brains. These people welcome the unnatural constraints of FP with open arms. People coming to programming from the real world, do not (in my experience) welcome the constraints of FP at all.\n\nIt's very interesting to me that Dynamicland appears (from afar, I've never been there), in it's pursuit of a more natural and \"humane\" programming, to have basically gone completely the opposite direction to FP. As far as I can tell the entire room\/operating system operates on a single massive global database.",

Decomposing a program into modules with information hiding and well designed interfaces is *hard*. Users are happy to use a flat programming model where all of their data is globally accessible. Granger mentioned an example of a user that built a single large spreadsheet (multiple gigabytes) modelling an entire company. The node and wire style of visual programming language that I mentioned is compatible with a flat programming model. You just need a zoomable interface that can handle large numbers of nodes.",
