Commands are fully decoupled and there is a VERY simple communication mechanism (lines of text with newlines acting as line separators - everything else is just bytes (it could be simpler :-)).  0D.  True decoupling results in software components that you can plug together like using a patchboard synthesizer.\n2. Future shell language? <http:\/\/Draw.io|Draw.io>, Excalidraw, etc. I toyed with this concept a zillion years ago. My experimental code is at <https:\/\/github.com\/guitarvydas\/vsh> (this experiment uses yEd and was done before I discovered <http:\/\/drawio.io|drawio.io> and Excalidraw)",
