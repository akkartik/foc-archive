I felt like the whole conversation had that pattern, and even if I remember that incorrectly, I still feel like that generalization seems valid. You can probably just open a random other thread and find the pattern there.\n\nIt’s just so frustrating to see how we are always stuck on the what and the how, and we keep arguing on that level, and never really try to get at the why, the values that drive us, which seem easier (not easy!) to get at least some people to agree on.

I felt like the whole conversation had that pattern, and even if I remember that incorrectly, I still feel like that generalization seems valid. You can probably just open a random other thread and find the pattern there.\n\nIt’s just so frustrating to see how we are always stuck on the what and the how, and we keep arguing on that level, and never really try to get at the why, the values that drive us, which seem easier (not easy!) to get at least some people to agree on. The what and how is so fragmented at this point that even people who fundamentally agree on the same values can’t collaborate, as "
