By my estimates, Academia is using far more closed-source, monthly-subscription software than private companies, tools like ArcGIS, R, Mathematica, Adobe Creative Suite, are all dirt cheap for students, but quite expensive for post-students, and that is the business model, of capturing academics with really nice packaged software that they will end up licensing as they graduate into companies. I see a bizarro world now, where academia is entrenched in commercial tools, and industry is going more open source and doing the R&amp;D at their own expense, and ignoring the academic output for the most part. I think the universities are so fat now, they are like the pentagon; with deans flying around in private jets, pulling 7 figures.
