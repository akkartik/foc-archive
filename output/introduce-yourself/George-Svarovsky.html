Hi! I'm George Svarovsky. For most of my career I've been engineering software for the scientific research domain, which has some interesting characteristics on the 'veracity' and 'variety' axes of big data management. So my primary interests lie broadly in the domains of software correctness and knowledge management.<br/><br/>My <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.5095.4400">MSc dissertation</a> was an experiment in taking some of the successful ideas found in software unit testing tooling to formal modelling, to try and encourage modelling as a first-class citizen in software repositories, verifiably tied to source code and tests. (I still think the idea has legs!)<br/><br/>I've always been a fan of the Semantic Web and the Resource Description Framework (RDF), ever since it popped up at the time I was trying to invent a graph-based metamodel for life sciences data. But while I enjoy its associated global-graph dreams and ontology navel-gazing as much as anyone, what I find compelling is actually the commitment to having a metamodel for data at all. I have distilled the problem I see here into a PhD <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wSauHwsUdyqnxEHMtc6xg-_3b00xovNYDnmFATG0zD8/edit?usp=sharing">research statement</a>.<br/><br/>After working on a personal project in the space of software architecture tooling, which needed multiplayer editing, I became interested in master-master data synchronisation and recent advances like Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). I've been in that space for a few years now as an independent researcher, supported by grants from the EU, working on a component that marries some of these ideas with the RDF (<a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2941/paper1.pdf">short paper</a>). It's intended to be a modest but useful tool for sharing live information, but it embodies some bigger ideas about the relationship between application code and the data it operates on, which I initially wrote about  in <a href="https://codeburst.io/the-data-%C3%A6ther-da22d28bc938">The Data Ã†ther</a>.<br/>I'm hoping to write more, and I look forward to bouncing ideas around here!
