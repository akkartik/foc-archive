Hi all :wave:<br/>I'm a developer based in Cambridge, UK. I discovered Future of Coding thanks to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Woods</span> and especially liked the episode about React history with Pete Hunt. I currently code in TypeScript and Swift, but I've done my first more or less serious coding in my life in Scheme and Tcl. Also had a bit of production experience with Haskell as well. I see there are mentions of music interests and visual programming here, and both topics are quite interesting to me. In my spare time I like poking modular synthesisers in something like Audulus (<a href="http://audulus.com">http://audulus.com</a>)<br/><br/>I'm currently building a framework inspired by React in pure Swift. I was very excited when React Hooks were announced, so I decided to drop the class-based API altogether and only implement a Hooks API. I still need to implement a few more hooks and host components, but I hope I'm much closer to a point where it can be used for real iOS apps and some other platforms in the future, when more renders are added. You can check out my current progress here if you're interested: <a href="https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/Gluon">https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/Gluon</a><br/>If this thing gets any traction, I'd like to build visual developer tools for it in the future.<br/><br/>Thanks for the podcast and the community, super excited to learn more from you all!
