I just watched this, thanks! Very stimulating, and it was a pleasure to see something that goes past the usual anodyne prescriptions for programming, taking them instead for granted and building on them.<br/><br/>I have a couple of follow-up questions for <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Corey Montella</span>:<br/><br/>1. In the first example of sanitized strings you choose to hide some code behind an opaque boundary. But surely you could choose to add an opaque boundary for any single line of your program. Would this line of reasoning tell us that more functions in a program are always better than fewer functions?<br/><br/>The key seems to be to ensure that the abstract level-3 predicate (the <em>abstraction</em>) is externally grounded in the world. Naming the function the same as the level-3 predicate (<tt>sanitize</tt>) kinda hides that.<br/><br/>2. In the second example of arrays as conditionals you again rely upon an external sense of what the right abstraction is (history about the nth president). Arguably the server-side constants could have similar reasoning, but it would require encoding the <em>why</em> behind them, something you allude to earlier. Comparing a familiar example with an unfamiliar one kinda hides that.<br/><br/>For me the lesson from example 2 was that conditionals are a sign that you haven't encoded the <em>why</em> of your programs thoroughly enough. But it seems like an open problem to be able to encode arbitrary rationales in formal logic (going back to Leibniz: <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/2016/11/10/let-us-calculate-leibniz-llull-and-computational-imagination">https://publicdomainreview.org/2016/11/10/let-us-calculate-l&hellip;</a>).<br/><br/>Combining the two examples, for me program synthesis -- whether by human or by robot -- seems reliant on the mental models of the world encoded by the synthesizer. And the notion of "abstraction" abstracts away too much from that broader notion of a mental model.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>To identify just one of the gaps, we need also elements of <em>consequence</em>. "You can't do x because then y would happen, which is undesirable." (That connects up also with the notion of consequentialist ethics: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism</a>)<br/><br/>I suspect the server-side example in particular is due to that sort of scenario-based reasoning. For example, there are knobs in memory allocators that trade off efficiency of allocation with the risk of fragmentation. Numbers can sometimes encode simulation rather than logical statements.
