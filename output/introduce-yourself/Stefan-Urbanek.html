Hello, I am Stefan, software engineer.<br/><br/>I have spent most of my career in data warehousing, almost everything from tool making to architecture. I am author of Cubes - former light-weight data warehouse toolkit in Python, now discontinued.<br/><br/>Exploring alternative ways of “problem modelling”, especially for the domain complex systems. From engineering perspective that lead me to a curious question: whether “everything is a graph” programming language is feasible and if yes, how it would look like.<br/><br/>Currently prototyping a library and a tiny domain specific programming language for modelling and simulation of dynamical systems. (Might release a prototype soon).<br/><br/>Happy to be here. Cheers.
