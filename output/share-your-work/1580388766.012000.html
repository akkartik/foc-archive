not necearily future of coding, but "making the present suck less" :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>&gt; we want to avoid having to introduce the syntax early on, but we want to be able to transition to it slowly and maximize the amount of things they learn to apply once they move to writing HTML by hand, that's why I'm doing a prototype of the tool we may use, I recorded a video with an overview and the ideas behind it:<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqTLUAWCM4M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqTLUAWCM4M</a>

Very cool! I like it. :slightly_smiling_face: Definetly a usefull tool for my workshop with kids (but translated in french). And I am sure this kind of representation can also be usefull for people wanting to create HTML.

I had no idea you teach, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mariano Guerra</span>. Can you say more about that side of things? How does the teaching interact with Instadeq?<br/><br/>Totally bookmarking this as one of the inspirations I want to build Mu up towards. I've wrestled before with the problem of teaching programming to someone who doesn't know any text editor (<a href="http://akkartik.name/post/mu">http://akkartik.name/post/mu</a>) and this is a very nice solution to that problem.

Me and a friend of mine gave twice a course in our city in argentina to woman without prior programming experience. It's a side thing, not related with instadeq at all. The first two courses where done with a written curriculum (here you can check it, it's in spanish but you can see the screenshots, code and demos <a href="https://creemosenlaweb.github.io/">https://creemosenlaweb.github.io/</a>) we started with mozilla thimble since it was online and interactive, but they closed it down so we migrated to glitch which is ok but a little bit too heavy.

one of the objectives was no setup at all, just a modern browser and instant feedback from the changes, we tried to go small steps and always showing the results. I think the syntax made more than one "not see the forest" because they were learning about how to structure a document at the same time they were learning the strange ways our tools expect us to tell them about the document we want

but we also didn't wanted to use tools that would ease the development of websites but that were unrelated with what's used in reality, so no wird dsls or tools that don't map to html/css/js

the fact that we had to teach 3 totally different syntaxes and semantic to get a basic button handler doesn't help
