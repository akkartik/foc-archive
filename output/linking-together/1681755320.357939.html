Someone is trying to boot Linux from a Scratch project. :open_mouth::exploding_head::heart_eyes_cat:<br/><br/>In fact, it's a RISC-V emulator programmed with Scratch.<br/><br/>Here is his journey (quoting the author):<br/>&gt; I actually started this project with not very much understanding of RISC-V, but after a few hours of debugging I got the hang of it. The emulator was actually based of off <a href="https://github.com/cnlohr/mini-rv32ima">https://github.com/cnlohr/mini-rv32ima</a>, which i ported to Java a while back, and from Java I ported to SCPP (A programming language I wrote) and from SCPP I ported it to here [(i.e. plain Scratch)].<br/>Regarding SCPP:<br/>&gt; SCPP (Scratch C Plus Plus) <a href="https://github.com/Its-Jakey/SCPP">https://github.com/Its-Jakey/SCPP</a><br/>It's really interesting to see the creativity of people that learned programming with Scratch, then start exploring new horizons to eventually come back to Scratch.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/scratch/comments/12k8kvu/got_linux_booting_on_scratch/">https://www.reddit.com/r/scratch/comments/12k8kvu/got_linux_booting_on_scratch/</a>
