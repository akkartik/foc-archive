        "text": "Anyone have an opinion on implicit member access vs explicit? Or even better, seen any concrete research or reason for one over the other?\n\nWhat I mean is C++, Java, C#, Swift, etc when you're in a method you can access members of the current instance implicitly. You don't have to specify `this` or `self`\n\n```\nclass Rect {\n   int width;\n   int height;\n   int area() {\n      return width + height;  \/\/ implicit\n   }\n}\n```\n\nvs\n\n```\nclass Rect {\n   int width;\n   int height;\n   int area() {\n      return this.width + this.height; \/\/ explicit\n   }\n}\n```\n\nI feel like I prefer explicit over implicit. IMO it makes the code more readable since I can look at the only the line in question a little easier. In the implicit case when `area()` is defined many lines below I'd have no idea if `width` and `height` are variables in a more outer scope, global variables, or member variables. In the explicit case I immediately know they are member variables. That seems like a win. It also means one less argument over naming conventions. Microsoft use to use `m_variable`. Google uses `variable_`. That would all disappear if the language required explicitness like python and JavaScript for example.\n\nWhat are some negatives? I can see one being typing but if for all other reasons explicit is better than implicit then some language could just shorten the syntax. `_.height` for example.",

I guess I’m really imagining a full IDE-like GUI overlay with editor services acting on the syntax tree getting structure-edited. As <@UC21F8Q48> was describing, this could be a richer medium in which the results of editor services interspersed with the code being written. Maybe this isn’t quite possible with today’s plugin architectures (could you do this in Glamorous Toolkit? haven’t looked into it much). But if you could (which sounds feasible both technically and culturally given editor trends over the past ten years), then you could have a rich medium of interaction but still rely on existing text-based tooling for persistence and version control. <@U8A5MS6R1> I agree that you’re fundamentally limited by the underlying language and that there would be benefit in designing languages from the ground up with the UI in mind, but I don’t see why those richer interaction mediums have to be at odds with current VC tooling. Maybe I’m missing a point\/example here.",

So when you choose to use \"this\", then you must *always* say \"this.x\".\n\nThe usage of closures I described does not have any \"this\" at all, not even an implicit one. And it doesn't extend the categories, it reduces them: it's essentially throwing out member access altogether, and instead accessing everything directly through lexical scope -- not something else that can be *confused with* lexical scope, but actual lexical scope to begin with.\n\nIt's no different than referring to \"x\" in:\n```function foo(x) {\n   ...\n   return x;\n}```\nThat \"x\" is not short for \"foo.x\". There isn't a \"this\" that holds x, it's just the x in the current lexical scope. And you're not going to confuse the x in foo(123) with the x in foo(456), because both calls create a different \"instance\" of that scope.\n\nClosures are about holding onto values in that scope, rather than attaching them to some \"this\" object. For example:\n```function plus(x) {\n   return function(y) {\n      return x + y;\n   }\n}\n\nvar plus2 = plus(2);\nvar plus4 = plus(4);\n\nplus2(5); \/\/ result is 7\nplus4(5); \/\/ result is 9```\nPlus takes some x, and returns a function that adds that x to some y. Each call to plus activates a new \"instance\" of that scope, with its own value for x, and returns a *new* function that uses *that* x.\n\nWhen you want to create multiple functions for one set values, you can return an object that has them as properties. This might be where it gets confusing, because it *looks* like member access:\n```function foo(x, y) {\n   function sum() { return x + y; }\n   function diff() { return x - y; }\n   function inc() { x = x + 1; }\n   return { sum, diff, inc };\n}\n\nvar a = foo(1,2);\nvar b = foo(3,4);\na.sum(); a.diff(); \/\/ 3, -1\nb.sum(); b.diff(); \/\/ 7, -1\na.inc();\na.sum(); a.diff(); \/\/ 4, 0\nb.sum(); b.diff(); \/\/ 7, -1```",
