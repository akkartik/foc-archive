Hello all. I figure it’s time I should formally introduce myself. I’m a programmer in Virginia who’s eagerly looking for the future of coding. My dream is to unlock the power of computing for non-programmers. I’ve seen this done particularly well in Dynamics CRM, Microsoft Excel, and in the now-abandoned Eve language. I’m particularly interested in logic programming, query languages (like Datalog), and the semantic web, so naturally I pay close attention to Dustin Getz’ Hyperfiddle project. Clojure is my weapon of choice, but I’m developing an appreciation for static types and the expressivity they bring, and am interested in exploring formal methods and dependently-typed languages like Idris. I also have an avid interest in how philosophy bears on computation, and how a humane philosophy can work itself out into humane software. I’m very grateful to have found this group. Here’s to the future of coding :clinking_glasses:
