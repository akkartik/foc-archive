I want to work on the foundations of programming and on interoperability, and I think my work is relevant to everyone here. Many researchers, for instance, have made experimental programming languages and environments - but they can't interoperate with each other! Many languages can only interoperate with C, one of the most archaic languages in existence!<br/><br/>We must break down these silo walls, so I want to work on those common foundations: to figure out a way to let you write a library in a language that will convert itself to several different languages and run easily on many platforms. To figure out how to standardize everything from point data types (X,Y coordinates), to D-style ranges (an abstraction for subsequences), to whatever data types neural networks are made of, to the way debuggers work. (current thinking: a StackOverflow-like site where people vote on interface designs?). In short, I want to solve the technical problems that create friction in both the niche of programming language design and in the broader world of software engineering. (But, as I say, no time, can't do it. It's funny to have enough urgent work to fill a lifetime, but treat it like a minor hobby to do on weekends sometimes.)<br/><br/>Oh and Bret Victor inspired me yada yada I invent on principle blah blah. Like the rest of y'all :slightly_smiling_face: But seriously, Bret Victor FTW.<br/><br/>Twitter: @DPiepgrass  Site: <a href="http://david.loyc.net">david.loyc.net</a>

The interface (standardized data types) is indeed a major problem. Just don’t forget to support sum types (aka unions aka variants).

Welcome! Your introduction resonates more with me than most. I’ve been thinking similarly for a while, and currently (weakly) conclude that our notion of “programming language” is ill-posed.<br/><br/>90% of the complexity of a language is in the implementation and runtime (the “engine”). This complexity is hidden behind a superficially simple skin (the “bumper”). That’s great, but it’s caused programmers to spend all their time arguing about the shape and color of the bumper, with far less attention devoted to the engine itself. We require new models of a car brand to conform to the same exact bumper shapes as before. Everytime somebody gets frustrated with the existing variety of cars, they immediately start thinking about what new shape of bumper to build that will solve all their problems.<br/><br/>I don’t expect you to agree with me, but hopefully you find it thought-provoking. Might the troubles languages have interoperating be a symptom of a deeper malaise? I totally buy the value of interop between languages: it allows one to mix and match multiple runtimes to their diverse strengths. For example, Python with Erlang’s scheduler would be <em>awesome</em>. But existing languages are highly constrained in their degrees of freedom, and creating interop in a way that survives version upgrades seems to create even more constraints. What constraints should we trade off in exchange for better interop?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> - Totally agree about "bumpers".<br/><br/>After trying to make my own super-self-aware programming language, I discovered that languages themselves are also just "bumpers"!<br/><br/>If you think of a complier as an interpreter, and source code written in a compiled language as the code to "interpret", then that code is actually just an <b>interpreted</b> program written in a funny declarative language that can only do one thing: generate a compiled program. The statements are all like "create a new instance of class, like this" or "create this AST like this", all followed by a giant implicit command to generate machine code (or something else) from it.<br/><br/>If you replace a compiler with a set of libraries for creating, manipulating, and processing AST structures (i.e. code represented as data), then you could use it however you want (e.g. selectively), customize it, supplement it with your own stuff, and/or combine language features -- because it's all just functions that you call.

... and if each function or structure had metadata attached to it, and if there was a special editor that would look at that metadata to decide how to display it, then it could still look like "normal code" (or something better) even though the "language" is a combination of things

unfortunately it is completely infeasible to bring the languages together. If you stick to rudimentary arithmetical data types like JS' Float64 implied type which holds all numeric values you can map that to C's equivalent, but you can't go the other way, because JS doesn't have int or unsigned int, or single characters, or single precision floating point, nor does it have 64 bit integers and unsigned integers. So right there, between those 2 languages you can't swallow anything general from C unless the C code restricts itself to a small subset emulating JS. One can in general model a more restrictive language in a more expansive one that is closer to the full intel instruction sets. But the goal of sharing libraries between languages is fairly hopeless. Web assembly down the road may become a somewhat standard virtual instruction set, but in Web Assembly you also have the problem that simple atomic things in many languages are very complex internal structures, like the very general array type in JS, and concepts in Python simply don't exist in JS. If the two languages are similar enough, like ActionScript 3 and JS, i have found that simple text editing scripts will convert 99% of AS3 code into JS. So there are some easy mappings out there. Since there are Python to C compilers out there, that mapping has been achieved. But I doubt very much you can go C to Python. So we are fairly doomed to eternity to keep rewriting similar libraries over and over, unless we picked a very stripped down language that could be exported to most others by some straightforward conversion process. Something like Modula-2 which is among the simplest languages ever devised, however, it presumes record structures which don't exist in many languages today, and one would have to restrict oneself to not using the VAR parameter type, as many languages today like JS and AS3 don't allow you to change a value from inside a function unless it is a property of an object. In fact the closer you get to the Intel/ARM hardware, the more problematic many modern languages are, with their typical insistence on garbage collection instead of explicit allocation/deallocation.

For bridging to C, I've found SWIG remarkably productive and hassle free <a href="http://www.swig.org/">http://www.swig.org/</a>.  Certainly doesn't feel comfy though.
