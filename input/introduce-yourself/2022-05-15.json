I've been working on creating more fluid interactions for code editing for the past few years, mostly based on the idea that to move something you should be able to just drag and drop it, and other variations on matching the interaction to the underlying thought process. I've implemented a few of these ideas in my latest project, Treefrog (<https:\/\/treefrog-editor.com>). I'm hoping to organise a meetup in York, UK this summer - DM me if you're interested in getting together!",
