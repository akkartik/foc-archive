It's also worth consider how often you need to work with object centers rather than the corner of their AABB. I find I mostly work with centers, so I actually prefer top/left because that's unambiguous. Saying x/y could mean the corner point, or the center point, or an origin point / center of rotation.<br/><br/>Also agree with Wouter â€” Rects are best represented as pairs of vectors.
