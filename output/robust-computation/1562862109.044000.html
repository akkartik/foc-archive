Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andreas S.</span>.  Thanks for the question, and just for taking a look.  For an indefinitely scalable machine, I find my initial 'computational thinking' keeps getting turned kind of inside out by 'systems thinking'.  Q: Wouldn't it be super inefficient to have to bring critical data to a computation from far away?  A: Sure, so let's arrange to keep it close by.  Q: But what if we didn't know we needed it ahead of time?   A: Then how critical could it really be?   Or:  Q: How do even we get a 100MB image into the machine to process it?  A: If the image is at all important, usually it'll already be in there; then see previous question.  And so on.
