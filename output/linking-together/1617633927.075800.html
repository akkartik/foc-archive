&gt; But when spreadsheets get <b>complicated</b> they get messy and error-prone and this is what Improv set out to address.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; In the end it didn’t go anywhere, probably because in setting out to improve on spreadsheets, Improv lost the essence of a spreadsheet and in doing so <b>lost the market</b>.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; this would lead you to the conclusion that the key strategy <b>mistake</b> was to try to market Improv to the existing spreadsheet market. Instead, if the product were marketed to a segment where the more structured model was a ‘feature’ not a ‘bug’ would have given Lotus the time to learn and improve and refine the model to a point where it would have <b>satisfied</b> the larger market as well.<br/><a href="https://medium.com/pito-s-blog/why-improv-didnt-succeed-3e06a43acf73">https://medium.com/pito-s-blog/why-improv-didnt-succeed-3e06a43acf73</a>
