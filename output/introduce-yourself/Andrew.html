Hi, I’m Andrew — I started studying CS after choosing a major in EE. My first professional experience was as a firmware engineer, now I’m a web developer (as tends to happen in our field).<br/><br/>I was inspired by this article: <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/notes/alan-kay-lunch.html">https://futureofcoding.org/notes/alan-kay-lunch.html</a> which is how I found the community. I want to push the needle forward for the field, and I want to try my hand at doing more “academic” work than I’m typically used to as a web developer, which is mostly remixing components so your customer has a good experience.<br/><br/>Hoping some people here are interested in doing the same and can point me in the right direction :slightly_smiling_face:
