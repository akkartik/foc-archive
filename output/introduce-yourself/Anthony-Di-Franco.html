Hi all, I've come this way because <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> pointed out <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dave Ackley</span>'s work to me via a mention by Venkat Rao whose <a href="http://ribbonfarm.com">ribbonfarm.com</a> blog cult we're both part of. I have a background in control and systems theory and information theory and I've been working on a kind of closed-loop approach to declarative programming. This has involved defining a progress measure for a computation in terms of an information-gain game between the system and the logic/environment, and an adaptive evaluation procedure based on trying to maximize performance in this game. More concretely, it's a probabilistic relational language written in Julia that uses ideas from game tree search to learn to do well at that game. The main strategy for optimizing is finding highly informative inference paths connecting facts to queries, which are essentially dataflows, so I got some ideas about a dataflow-oriented but still general purpose VM/hardware which I'm calling the Route Machine and which I think might synergize quite well with the Movable Feast Machine ideas. Looking forward to discussing more.<br/>I also enjoyed a quick look at the podcast backlog and am keen on taking in more of the culture. I've been a bit dry since Lambda the Ultimate declined in activity.
