Thanks for creating this community! I am excited to get to know people here and work together!<br/><br/>motivation<br/>• I'm looking for a programming environment where I can go from an idea to an implementation as quickly as possible.<br/>domain of interest<br/>• I am interested in tools which enable sophisticated end-users to build their own interfaces and functionality to manage their data and social networks, discover like-minded people and collaborate with them effectively.<br/>• I have a particular app/system I want to build — "Network of trust". It can solve the problem of fake accounts (my presentation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZJ-BercOGg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZJ-BercOGg</a>) and also enables you to weigh opinions of different people by trustworthiness of these people derived from trust chains from you to this or that person in the corresponding competence area. (I see it as a solution to what Alan Kay once wrote about: "the [information] retrieval systems of the future are not going to retrieve facts but points of view" <a href="https://vk.com/trustnet?w=wall-56630573_84_r91">https://vk.com/trustnet?w=wall-56630573_84_r91</a>)<br/>ideal<br/>• I want the highest-level programming that is possible: I communicate to an IDE my intentions (goals, restrictions, preferences) and the IDE gives me a working version of a program satisfying these conditions, which I then can customize and try using, then update my intentions and go to the next iteration, etc.<br/>some wishes<br/>• Functionality discovery right in the IDE, integrated with external sources (libraries, APIs). When I want to do something but yet do not know how to do it in this particular language, the IDE should be helpful to find that out (instead of googling manually). Ideally the solutions thus found should be already plugged-in and working with my actual data without the need for manually setting them up. E.g. when I want to plot a bar chart from my data, the IDE fetches several libraries that can do that (sorted by some ranking of relevancy and quality) and shows me the actual results of these options (with my actual data) so I can choose which I like more.<br/>• I can organize my code spatially (in 2D or even 3D). So that when I want to edit my program, I always know where to look for relevant parts of code to edit or add to.<br/>• Structured code editing, with the impossibility of syntax errors. Ability to select and edit whole semantic entities instead of just editing text characters. Convenient refactoring.<br/>programming experience<br/>• I learned a bit of Pharo Smalltalk, then made some projects with Javascript and Node.js (<a href="https://hatsevich.ru/programming_portfolio.html">https://hatsevich.ru/programming_portfolio.html</a>). Working in Pharo IDE was much more convenient then editing text files (javascript/node.js). Maybe I should return to it and use it for backend — unless you point me to something better.<br/>some thoughts on programming I wrote earlier<br/>• "Why programming languages are broken and how we can fix them" <a href="https://www.facebook.com/g.hatsevich/posts/742023955927813">https://www.facebook.com/g.hatsevich/posts/742023955927813</a><br/>• "Tool-oriented programming" <a href="https://www.facebook.com/g.hatsevich/posts/741820789281463">https://www.facebook.com/g.hatsevich/posts/741820789281463</a><br/>Interesting links on the "perfect programming" topic I found I posted here: <a href="https://vk.com/perfect_programming">https://vk.com/perfect_programming</a>
