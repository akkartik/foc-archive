Then, each frame, you increment the time and compute a new intermedia value to display. But then what do you do if, midway through the transition, the destination needs to change? Or what happens if you need to cancel the transition mid-flight? You'll probably get discontinuities.\n\nA better approach might be to store a current value and velocity, as well as a function that handles acceleration with respect to some goal value (again, could be a spring). Then if you need to change the destination, you can just change the acceleration function, and the velocity changes smoothly as a result, and you don't get discontinuities. But what if you need to revert the transition, and return to the start point? You'll need to store that too.\n\nIf this is the level of design thinking you're looking for, the best thing I remember coming across is a WWDC session titled <https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2018\/803\/|Designing Fluid Interfaces>, where they talk about _the stuff you want_ when designing an animation abstraction, plus how to design the coding interface so that it's artist-friendly (in other words, so that you can more easily predict what sort of motion you'll get when specifying parameters).\n\nHope that helps!",
