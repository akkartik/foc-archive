So a hello-world is kinda the first thing dev’s do when trying a language (generally speaking). Do you feel there is a more valuable example? One issue we have seen is that when we use “slack bots” or “twitter streamers” the reaction from most is thinking that is all we do :disappointed: which is sad and not representative of what we really can do.\n\n&gt; You need a better example to show off its strengths.\nWe have examples at <https:\/\/github.com\/storyscript\/examples> — I agree a better example would be nice.\n\n&gt; Maybe you receive a request and make a request elsewhere?\nLike this: <https:\/\/storyscript.io\/blog\/story-telling\/> (scroll to about mid page)\n\n&gt; Or make a request elsewhere and postprocess its results before sending them back?\nThat could be cool! I do think something usable and not to abstract is best. Otherwise, IMO the developer could get lost in the “why” rather than experiencing the product’s power.",
