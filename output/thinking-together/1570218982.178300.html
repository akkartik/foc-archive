Being too early is the worst thing of all. my father invested his life savings in electric vehicles in 1970, because gas was getting expensive at 35 cents a gallon, and pollution was  a problem... oops 50 years later and electric cars in the USA are about 1% market share.... Panasonic used to advertise with the slogan "just slightly ahead of our time", that is the best place to be. I saw a Xerox Star system at Micropro which made the worstar word processor. The Star system cost $50k, way too much for a secretary's computer which is what it was intended for. It worked well, but the idea of giving the secretary the most advanced computer in the company was a non-starter for a status-conscious society that we have.
