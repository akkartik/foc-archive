:wave: Hi everyone! I'm a London-based developer who pivoted from corporate events and TV production on a recent AppleTV+ show to software engineering after the writers/actors strike. Since graduating from a software bootcamp, I've worked on several internships and contract roles, but I'm now seeking full-time opportunities as a software/solutions engineer.<br/><br/>Outside of tech, I co-run a charity redirecting unsold supermarket food to food banks (150,000+ meals saved!) and organises sleeping bag distributions for rough sleepers. Last week, we believe we ran the UK's largest sleeping bag handout, providing 380 bags across 8 cities.<br/><br/>I'd love to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harry-sotnick-hommel/">connect</a> with anyone with potential job leads or offering mentorship in the software / solutions space!
