If you relate that to structural editing like I just did, that would be a syntax error. The onscreen keyboard in iOS prevents me from inputting that incorrect state.\n\nLet’s not forget that the “easy” way of text editing from the past based on ASCII was based on Americans building something that didn’t even consider any other languages, alphabets, scripts, and cultures. That was all bolted on afterwards with code pages until we got to Unicode. Now we have a technology that sort of works for almost every person on the planet who can read and write (and Klingons!) — and that turned out to be a little more complex problem to solve. But I take that over any simple solution that only works by excluding a majority of people based on their language or culture."
