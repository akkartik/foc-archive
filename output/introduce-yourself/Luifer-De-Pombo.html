Hi everyone, I'm Luis. I'm originally from Colombia, but have lived in the Bay Area for many years. I worked as a software / infrastructure engineer at startups and bigger companies for a while and have often had to rewrite backends to be more efficient or scalable. I dream of a day in which the same program/backend can run on a single core or across many machines in the cloud without any operational complexity (extra deployment configuration or maintenance), extra code (frameworks or vendor APIs) or constraints (delayed execution, limited runtime, no persistent connections, etc). I created a new programming language with a friend to see if we could create a compiled language with a simplified bytecode, wrt to traditional languages which allow arbitrary computation that is not guaranteed to halt, that could be automatically parallelized by a VM/runtime (written in Rust :crab:) based on the size and shape of the data. It is still very much in an alpha state, but lmk if you want to learn more or have feedback for us!<br/><a href="https://github.com/alantech/alan">https://github.com/alantech/alan</a>
