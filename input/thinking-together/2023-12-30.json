There are other ways to slice things up I’m sure. But regardless of the division, I don’t see why we would want to do that. \n\nI don’t think these activities form a natural kind. So it doesn’t seem we are trying to get at the truth by making these divisions. Instead we are trying to rank them. We are trying to say some of these are more sophisticated or nobler than the other. “That’s just programming, not true software engineering”. \n\nI especially don’t understand the point of drawing a distinction between programming and software engineering. What do we gain by making this distinction? Is the act of planning how to write a program really not part of the programming activity? If I’m drawing up plans for how I’m going to make a chair, am I really involved in an activity distinctly different from wood working?\n\nBy drawing these distinctions we also open the door for the division of labor to occur. This creates the awful concept of “architect”. The perhaps most harmful concept we’ve ever created as a profession. ",

Excluding a small region of math, it's all one amorphous beast we haven't found the bones for yet, let alone start to cleave at the joints.

I tend to be suspicious of both terms. They mean about as much as my PhD in CS, particularly since they were all minted in academia under peculiar incentives. CS and SE are buzzwords, not jargon. Excluding a small region of math, it's all one amorphous beast we haven't found the bones for yet, let alone start to cleave at the joints. And yes, this includes what Greg Wilson does and whatever it is that Stephen Wolfram does. I tend to call it programming, since that was good enough for Dijkstra.\n\n(I stand ready to duck.)"

I specifically said software engineering is the study of practices. There’s a parasitic sense in which you can say “someone who applies that study is doing software engineering, not just programming”, but imo, that’s less useful. Hence as a title, software engineer isn’t usefully different from programmer. \n\nBasically, the distinction is not really between two activities, but between an academic discipline and an activity. The question you’re asking (or saying doesn’t make sense to ask) is a bit like asking “are you a writer or a historian?” It’s not an either or. But a writer isn’t the same thing as a historian in spite of that.",

Hence as a title, software engineer isn’t usefully different from programmer. \n\nBasically, the distinction is not really between two activities, but between an academic discipline and an activity.
