Hey! I'm Piotr. I've found FoC by googling for non-coding services.<br/><br/>I've created a service for building machine learning models without coding: <a href="https://mljar.com">https://mljar.com</a><br/><br/>I'm not happy with my service. It's only building ML models. Users need to do a lot of additional work to use the ML model in production. And I think that knowing how to use ML models is maybe too complex.<br/><br/>I would like to extend/change the mljar. I would like to let users do data analysis (dashboards and apps). I've started looking at different non-coding platforms for data science. This is how I've found this community :slightly_smiling_face:
