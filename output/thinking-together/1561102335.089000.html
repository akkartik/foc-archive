Type declarations have a twofold purpose; one is to let the compiler know how big a box to create to store the value, and the other purpose is to reduce programmer error. Nowadays with gigantic memory stores, worrying about how big a box to store is of minor importance for 99% of programs, and so the real benefit is about reducing programmer error. Most of the time spent programming is fixing errors, and anything that helps reduce programmer error should be encouraged. What does it mean to multiply PI by "hello"? if you can catch an error at compile time, it eliminates the potentially crazy result that the computer might generate from an operation like PI * "hello".
