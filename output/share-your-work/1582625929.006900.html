<b>Feedback request:</b> brother and I just finished first prototype of Wasp - higher-level programming language for building web apps - would love to get your feedback!<br/>Webpage (with demo): <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev">https://wasp-lang.dev</a>, Github repo: <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp">https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp</a> .<br/>We are still very early / experimental, and current demo is yet far away from our vision, but it should illustrate some basic concepts.<br/>Our main challenge is designing the language so it captures the correct abstractions and is easy to use, while also making it flexible enough to be useful. Plan for now is to find inspiration in current popular frameworks and similar solutions + guide development by specific use cases (we started with Todo App).<br/>Thanks!

It's a cool story and you've presented it well. I think it's a good name for a language! Building web apps still can be a hassle. What do you see the long term advantages might be? Do you think for web apps you really need a number of DSLS (frontend, routing, persistence, testing, deploying, etc)? What do you think the costs might be to develop the language tooling that would make this a net-win for users?

Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@breck7</span>!<br/><br/>&gt; long term advantages<br/>Long term advantage would be code that is closer to specification, shorter and more maintainable. Also, easier to write, lowering the knowledge barier needed to build a web app and allowing faster prototyping.<br/><br/>&gt; you really need a number of DSLS<br/>I am not sure what exactly you mean by this, so pls correct me if I did not answer the question.<br/>Idea of Wasp is that you get a lot of stuff done in a single DSL, that spans the concept of the whole web app. However, if there is something you need to customize in more details, and there is a good way out there to do it that people love, it probably makes more sense to do it that way then to reinvent the wheel in Wasp. Example of that is describing styling -&gt; css is made for that and although it has its issues, people use it, and it would be too big task for us to reinvent it, so Wasp will not try to replace css, but instead allow using it. Same goes for html/jsx for layouting, React/Vue for reusable components, Javascript/TS for general / business logic.<br/>Wasp as DSL serves the purpose of gluing this all together, removing unneeded complexity and hiding ugly/boring parts.<br/><br/>&gt; language tooling<br/>Good question! Since we are imagining it as a pretty horizontal DSL, I believe it will be very important to have a good way to discover options, so some kind of auto completion could help a lot. With LSP I am imagining this should not be so hard to develop for a couple of main editors, but I have never been developing language tooling so it is all a guess :).<br/><br/>I hope these answers are addressing the questions well - I would love to hear your opinions on these topics!

I will be interested in working on the LSP for this btw :smile:

Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ope</span>, we could certainly use help when we come to that point :)!
