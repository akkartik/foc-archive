        "text": "<@UE6EFEPTQ> — Point taken. I see where you're coming from. We're definitely in a tricky grey area here. Let me handle those two examples individually, in the hope that it'll help you feel a little more like you might have done the same if our roles were switched, or at the very least understand better the context behind what I said.\n\nFirst, your quote of me from the previous <#CEXED56UR|administrivia> thread, reflecting on Edward's use of the word \"cojones\" in a Steve Jobs anecdote.\n\n&gt; Now that we've had this thread, and a consensus has emerged — Edward de Jong \/ Beads Project, would you kindly change that post to say \"had the guts\" or something similarly innocuous?\nA few days before I started that thread, I wrote to Edward privately. Here's the entirety of what I said:\n\n&gt; &gt; The reason Steve Jobs is a legend in product development is because he had the cojones to order a million units of his products before he knew if it was going to be popular.\n&gt; \n&gt; (From this post)\n&gt; \n&gt; I'd like to keep the community free of this sort of gendered language. Would you edit your post to say something like \"guts\" instead of \"cojones\"?\n(The words \"this post\" were linked to the now-deleted message)\n\nHe never responded, and continued posting to the site, indicating to me that he ignored my message. This was the 3rd or 4th time I'd sent such a request to him. All previous requests of that sort, he'd responded to fairly quickly and refused, which led to us discussing the matter... sometimes for hours (sigh)... but it never resulted in him giving an inch.\n\nSo, after I resorted to starting a thread about how I should handle such situations, and he rolled in with..\n\n&gt; The second attempt by Ivan, who hates my guts, to try and get me kicked out of the group. I don't remember paying dues to hire a word\/thought police. I thought even dinosaurs such as myself were welcome.\n... I then responded in that thread with the post you quoted.\n\n&gt; Now that we've had this thread, and a consensus has emerged — Edward de Jong \/ Beads Project, would you kindly change that post to say \"had the guts\" or something similarly innocuous?\nThis was my way of re-upping the original private request that he'd ignored, once more with feeling. My appeal to the group consensus was in the hope that, since it seems he felt I had it in for him, he'd recognize that it wasn't just me who felt this way, and that I acted in the way many other people here would have acted. Yeah, groupthink a bit, I know, but this is me learning in public how to help deal with someone who has decided they don't care about how they make others feel.\n\n(The first \"attempt by Ivan [...] to try and get me kicked out\", I presume, is a reference to one of our long private discussions, which included me saying things like \"If I hear from anyone that you are harassing them via private message, I will have to ban you\" in response to him saying things along the lines of (not direct quote) \"Tell me who these people are who are complaining about me so I can confront them directly\". [I'm trying to be vague about what he said out of respect for Edward's privacy. Very difficult tightrope to walk when being asked to explain the few public flare-ups of lots of private simmering.])\n\n(Also, yes, I do make \"would you kindly\" BioShock references when issuing official requests in my capacity as mod, because the dark humour of it helps me personally deal with the heavy emotions.)",

Very difficult tightrope to walk when being asked to explain the few public flare-ups of lots of private simmering.])\n\n(Also, yes, I do make \"would you kindly\" BioShock references when issuing official requests in my capacity as mod, because the dark humour of it helps me personally deal with the heavy emotions.)"
