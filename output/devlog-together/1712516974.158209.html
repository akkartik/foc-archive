I've been fixing some bugs in the state-machine node-type in my visual programming system "code-flow-canvas" and also added a small media-library node-type which can be used by the show-image node-type.<br/>The show-image node-type can be controlled by the state-machine together with some UI node-types (button and slider).<br/>The show-image node-type also has an ability to change it's css and use flow parameters/variables (currently only the incoming value of a event/value special input-type.. I want to make this more generic in the near future so that you can send custom property-bags "over the wire" to other nodes).<br/><br/>The timeline slider doesn't work together nicely with the slider node-type yet, so I have to work on that further.<br/><br/>This example can be found on <a href="https://demo.codeflowcanvas.io">https://demo.codeflowcanvas.io</a> in the "examples" drop down: "Simple state machine with image and brightness".
