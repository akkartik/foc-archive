        "text": "<@UML4ZEKDK> Thanks for the pointer! Section 4.1 in that paper is really clarifying to me. I think some of my understanding of this static\/dynamic scope stuff has been off.\n\nI’ve thought of Scala implicits as dynamically scoped, because implicitly passed parameters to a function are passed on to things called in the function. But this sense of “things called in the function” is actually lexically defined, not dynamically defined! That is, if you define a closure in your function’s body, you pass implicit parameters to functions called in the closure – this binding can’t be intercepted by functions that end up on the call stack between the two functions.\n\nThis is perfectly analogous to the situation described in Section 4.1. So there’s some mechanism working here that I’ve always thought of as “dynamic scope” even though it’s really just “lexical scope implicitly propagated through function calls”. I think real dynamic scope is something you couldn’t resolve at compilation time, but all of these things (Effekt’s handlers, Scala implicits) are statically resolvable.\n\nHmm!\n\n(Looks like Effekt was previously implemented as a Scala library: <https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/services\/aop-cambridge-core\/content\/view\/A19680B18FB74AD95F8D83BC4B097D4F\/S0956796820000027a.pdf\/effekt_capabilitypassing_style_for_type_and_effectsafe_extensible_effect_handlers_in_scala.pdf|https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/services\/aop-cambridge-core\/content\/view\/A19680B18FB74[…]_type_and_effectsafe_extensible_effect_handlers_in_scala.pdf>)",

I think some of my understanding of this static\/dynamic scope stuff has been off.\n\nI’ve thought of Scala implicits as dynamically scoped, because implicitly passed parameters to a function are passed on to things called in the function. But this sense of “things called in the function” is actually lexically defined, not dynamically defined! That is, if you define a closure in your function’s body, you pass implicit parameters to functions called in the closure – this binding can’t be intercepted by functions that end up on the call stack between the two functions.\n\nThis is perfectly analogous to the situation described in Section 4.1. So there’s some mechanism working here that I’ve always thought of as “dynamic scope” even though it’s really just “lexical scope implicitly propagated through function calls”. I think real dynamic scope is something you couldn’t resolve at compilation time, but all of these things (Effekt’s handlers, Scala implicits) are statically resolvable.\n\nHmm!\n\n(Looks like Effekt was previously implemented as a Scala library: "
