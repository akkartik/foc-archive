To others it's a knowledge management system. Others might see a code analysis platform, a data visualization or an API browsing tool. Yet others see the graphical stack with its interactive editors. Glamorous Toolkit is all of these. But it's really also none of these. These are merely examples of the many forms the environment can be molded to. And there can be many more. Glamorous Toolkit is primarily an environment that makes it possible to create many experiences seamlessly and contextually.

But: kinda confusing.\n\nIt seems like you’re interested here in “parallel representations” – seeing the torus as a square (with identified opposite sides), as a 3D object, and as the configuration space of a pair of sliders. I’d really like to see more of that. For instance, in the “Input Spaces” section, could you show a point on a 3D torus alongside the two reps you have already?",
