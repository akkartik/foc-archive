Interesting looking structured JSON editor made in Visual Studio Code (<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=afterschool.depot">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=afterschool.depot</a>).  There is also a video demonstrating it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCTQvd3zkEg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCTQvd3zkEg</a>.  It is designed to be a visual editor for structured game data (common in games, actually), but appears to be pretty generic.  Makes me want to investigate VSCode Custom Editor functionality

I really appreciate you sharing this!<br/>It's a ~90% match for the UI I've been planning for the JSON editor in my "next Excel" tool, and I have yet to see anything similar in the wild.<br/><br/>This is a very early stage mock up of the tool: <a href="http://tableflow.org/studio/flow/#a">http://tableflow.org/studio/flow/#a</a><br/><br/>The 10% difference would be:<br/>I would handle the nested structure a bit differently. Instead of being visually nested, you would go to an entirely new view and just be shown a breadcrumb of your path. I was also thinking of doing a Kialo like UI element to show you where in the "tree" you are.<br/><a href="https://www.kialo.com/tour">https://www.kialo.com/tour</a><br/><br/>I was also planning on calling the larger structure "tables" not "lists".<br/><br/>Since the table editor would also have to handle external JSON, I was also going to include the concept of "tabs", ie varients/algebraic data types.<br/><br/>I had initially written off links as a "database-like" feature of ie AirTable, but now I'm reconsidering that. They may be useful for raw data.<br/><br/>Do you think these would be improvement? Any further suggestions?

Table flow looks cool.  I'll play around with it a little more and when I have some thoughts. Some nesting is probably better from a visual understanding standpoint, but your approach sounds like its better for deep nesting

I don't mean to be a critical but why not just use excel or google sheets and write a script to export to the format of your choice? The UI is much better. Far more people understand spreadsheet UIs than VSCode UIs. You get free collaboration. Maybe I missed it. Only watched half the video and gave up because he wasn't getting to the point of when it became interesting. It was literally 4 and half minutes until he did anything at all. I stopped at 19m

I think the advantage is it gives you a little bit of a visual schema, and you can do things like easily embed images, etc.

one disadvantage of spreadsheets is types and constraints, you could enforce with with scripting of course but you might not end up with an ideal UI

I've worked on a lot of games that have custom (hand written or partially generated) editors for structured data, and you can do variants of this inside popular game engines as well, but excel is also pretty widely used, UE4 can import excel spreadsheets directly, for example (<a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Gameplay/DataDriven/index.html">https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Gameplay/DataDriven/index.html</a>)

so I guess the answer is why write any custom tool? I guess it fit this persons needs more than excel did

Or maybe they didn't try excel? Excel embeds images as well. On a team I was on they used google sheets for bug tracking and pasted screenshots into cells. I'm not saying that was a good experience given there was no way to easily filter which bugs are fixed or who is looking into them plus loading a sheet with 500 screenshots is slow. But didn't see anything in the tool above that suggested it would do any better at these problems.<br/><br/>i'm not trying to put down custom tools, only from the video it looked like all they got from is particular one was an extremely tedious way of making basically a spreadsheet but minus 90% of the features, many of which are useful.
