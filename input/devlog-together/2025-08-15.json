Therefore every new tech is likely to start out as a silo, even without any intentions of domination. You can only plan for domination if you are a big player already. I doubt, for example, that Guido van Rossum was aiming for domination when he published Python 1.0 back in 1991. He even thought about interoperability with everything that mattered at the time: C and C-compatible languages. Today's BigTech is a different story of course.",
