Hey all, I'm Jasmine. I'm at UCSC Computational Media finishing up a thesis with Adam Smith on explorables-style bespoke creativity support tools, and how different kinds of experts use these tools in practice. I learned of this community a few years ago through Strange Loop.<br/><br/>I've been working for the past couple of years with aerospace operations experts and their scheduling practices, and with narrative designers to build static analysis tools for storylet-based games. In practice I've been building a lot of exploratory notebooks with different forms of direct manipulation, depending on the underlying domain-specific query logic. Very excited to talk about the future of software instruments and how they're made.
