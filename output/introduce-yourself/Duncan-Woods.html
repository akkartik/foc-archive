Hi, I'm Duncan,<br/><br/>I'm building <a href="https://thorny.io">https://thorny.io</a>, an interactive notebook for decision making.<br/>I want to help engineers tackle overwhelming design, planning and strategy problems where multiple decisions are tangled together.<br/><br/>The end goal is not a programming tool but it is still an end-user computation problem because at their most general level, decisions, plans and reasoning, are actually types of computation.<br/><br/>The underlying structure is a knowledge graph which includes possibilities and reasoning (similar to syntax tree).<br/>Like a spreadsheet, if you change the reasoning, decisions or beliefs, then the consequences ripple through the graph.<br/>The UI I have been exploring is<br/>- an outliner (effectively a structure editor for a reasoning notation)<br/>- with spreadsheet power (it supports formulas that reference other parts of the knowledge graph)<br/>The demos on the site are out of date and baffling, I will update them with the current version shortly!<br/><br/>I am based in Bristol UK. I studied CompSci at Cambridge and was previously head of software at an engineering firm building various design and optimization tools for engineers. I am interested in the typical Brett Victor topics plus:<br/>- non-monotonic reasoning<br/>- belief networks<br/>- logic programming<br/>- argument mapping<br/>- optimization and solvers<br/><br/>I have also built various compilers, code generation and visualization tools.<br/>I want to work more in the open and share more but I find it tough.<br/>I am so impressed with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> and this community, I have so much to learn here!
