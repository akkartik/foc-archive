I'm especially interested, because making the Nengo GUI was ridiculously hard and we're trying to rewrite it because we had no idea what we were doing the first time (bunch of Python devs writing their first web app). But I also can't find any real prior art for it which I could copy from? I think this is partially because our cognitive modelling system is super restrictive; all communication happens with vectors. When you step away from that restriction, the visualisation and computation domain balloons.
