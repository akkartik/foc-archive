Here's another domain — automation. "Hey Siri — set my living room lights to 50% brightness, close the blinds, and play some white noise. Save this as a new scene called 'Headache'." If you're going to use voice to invoke <em>something</em>, and that <em>something</em> can be customized, I'd like to see consideration for how you could customize it with your voice. Don't just think home automation, either. Think about building Automator actions, where there's only a small set of available commands and extremely simple composition. The risk of ambiguity is quite low.
