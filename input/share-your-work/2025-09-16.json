I see this as a brainstorming exercise on the various issues of 2D notations. I think that the discussion misses the elephant in the room - the mediums upon which the notations are created. Most of the notations discussed were based on the assumption of the use of quill and papyrus - 2D media.  These new-fangled things that are popularly called “computers” are something more than paper. They can represent notations in 4D (x\/y\/z\/t). Blender - I witnessed a colleague solve an otherwise hoary problem (optical distortion to produce a flight simulator display) using Blender in an evening or two. Audiophiles talk about “sound stage” (which I’ve witnessed first-hand) that is not adequately described by our 2D notation of sound waves. Notation influences thought and restricts what we can think about. Feynman diagrams are a good example of this - Feynman needed to break away from Gutenberg type-setting notation in order to think about and describe certain principles in physics.",
