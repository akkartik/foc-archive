Hi h! I’m Dustin.<br/><br/>After watching a few early 90s product demos on Jack Rusher’s Twitter, I found out about this Slack group. I’m endlessly curious about how we shape the tools we use and how the tools shape us. Following this curiosity introduced me to engineering and design. Work-wise, I’ve held various engineering and design roles: I worked at Walt Disney as a Software Engineer building the game engine for Club Penguin (RIP Flash), led the design team for the initial launch of Medium, and most recently,  I’m surrounded by a group of very talented and creative folks <a href="https://thebrowser.company/">building a new web browser called Arc</a>. Some recent work I’m proud of was exploring a playful UI to choose a color — <a href="https://twitter.com/dustin/status/1508500466505699331">https://twitter.com/dustin/status/1508500466505699331</a><br/><br/>Excited that this community exists. Excited to share ideas and learn from all of you:wave:
