Yeah, but at the risk of sounding like a nerd (<em>here!? no way!</em>) it has always felt <em>so dang cool</em> to get a computer to do something because I told it to with my own human meatspace voice. It's frustrating when it doesn't work, sure, but in a "56k modems were so slow!" sort of way, not a "why doesn't iOS have a system-wide convention for undo/redo?" way â€” in other words, we can start thinking about what neat things you could do with your voice now, with a fairly reasonable expectation that speech recognition will improve. It's not held back by (eg) bad design decisions; it's held back by the insufficiently-expanded boundary between advanced tech and magic.
