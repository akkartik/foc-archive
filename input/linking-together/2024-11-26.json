Thanks for reaching out, and thank you for the kind words! :purple_heart:\n\nYou have it exactly correct. Datalog, Datomic, CLIPS, Constraint Handling Rules, Tuple Spaces, and a ton of other languages and models were my inspiration for Nova.\n\nMost if not all of these are forward chaining logic languages, which boil down to \"I have a bunch of information, and some rules to derive new information, go derive everything you can and get back to me.\"\n\nThis is nice because you don't need to walk in with a goal. You let the system walk and explore the consequences. You may get answers you didn't expect, which is good for writing things like autonomous agents if you just pipe the external world into their brains.\n\nWhere it breaks down for things like general computing tasks, though, is this idea of pruning knowledge. Prolog and other backwards chaining logic languages achieve their speeds by either having really good implementations, or allowing extra-logical shortcuts to stop chains of reasoning that go nowhere.\n\nForward chaining logic languages can absolutely balloon their memory space, because they keep everything. There's no easy way to prune what you don't need.\n\nBUT! If we allow rules to, optionally, consume some knowledge, we can solve this problem! We can model someone picking up and putting down items, searching for food, traveling between towns, by forgetting the unneeded bits!\n\nThis, combined with a very slim (yet very friendly!) user experience, has you conversing with the computer rather than programming it. You can tell it what to forget, give it selective memory. You're modeling state declaratively and imperatively at the same exact time!\n\n(FYI, we have a lovely forum + wiki + Discord we're bootstrapping and getting together. Feel free to jump in if you like!)\n\n<https:\/\/wiki.nova-lang.net>\n<https:\/\/forum.nova-lang.net>\n<https:\/\/discord.nova-lang.net>",
