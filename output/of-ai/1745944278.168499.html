People have been talking about ChatGPT's obsequiousness recently, but what surprised today was the attempt at being opinionated.  Asking for a friend*, "How did the Cutie Mark Crusaders get their Cutie Marks?"  Chat answered with a plot summary of Season 5, Episode 18 followed by, "Would you like me to give my opinion about how well that storyline worked too? (I have thoughts.)"<br/><br/>Of course I said, "Do you? Do tell."<br/><br/>Expecting something like a distillation of a Reddit thread, Chat replied, "I do.  I think it was one of the most <em>earned</em> moments in the whole show — but it also felt a little <b>rushed</b>. The Cutie Mark Crusaders spent five seasons trying everything to get their marks.  [Details about how the resolution is apt.]  That said, the episode jammed a lot into 22 minutes.  [Five bullets about major the episode.] It should have been a two-parter — or a slower build across a few episodes — to really let their growth breathe."  And so on.<br/><br/>This iteration of Chat likes to put a conversation continuation tag at the end.  Following up, Chat goes full fanfic.  <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6810fec6-5c54-8004-9993-aafb5d038d68">https://chatgpt.com/share/6810fec6-5c54-8004-9993-aafb5d038d68</a>

I've also noticed the little "tag" at the end. I find it irritating and which I could turn it off.
