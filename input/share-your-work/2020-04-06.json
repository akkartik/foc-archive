                "text": "SHRDLU was an early  natural language understanding computer program, developed by Terry Winograd at MIT in 1968â€“1970. In it, the user carries on a conversation with the computer, moving objects, naming collections and querying the state of a simplified \"blocks world\", essentially a virtual box filled with different blocks.SHRDLU was written in the Micro Planner and Lisp programming language on the DEC PDP-6 computer and a DEC graphics terminal. Later additions were made at the computer graphics labs at the University of Utah, adding a full 3D rendering of SHRDLU's \"world\".\nThe name SHRDLU was derived from ETAOIN SHRDLU, the arrangement of the letter keys on a Linotype machine, arranged in descending order of usage frequency in English.",
