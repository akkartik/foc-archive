Don’t forget about IdealOS <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Josh Marinacci</span>, it’s really cool and I think would be of interest to people here <a href="https://joshondesign.com/2017/08/18/idealos_essay">https://joshondesign.com/2017/08/18/idealos_essay</a>. Welcome to this Slack!

As I sit here reading this essay, various technical solutions come to mind for the problems presented. So why can't I work on implementing these solutions? One is obvious - an OS is under the control of the companies that make it. A third party cannot simply add a feature to Windows that allows two concurrent users with their own screens, mouse and keyboard, let alone a system where two users share the same screens; MS wouldn't want to redesign the OS to allow things like that because it might reduce their revenue (two users should buy two licenses!)<br/><br/>More subtly, I'm not a businessman, I'm a developer, and I have no interest in the business side of launching a startup. I have ideas that no businessperson could possibly have (extensibility and interoperability being technical problems), but without a business model and a business guy that can dream up a path to profitability and find investors, I can't implement my ideas. (UBI FTW?)<br/><br/>More broadly, while the business side is always a challenge, for a great many "future of coding" problems, it seems to me that the current world order is structurally against solving them (the incentives are missing, and we need those incentives to buy food). Which is not to say that the problems won't get solved, just that it will be a very slow, painful, annoying process that we will have to fight hard to be involved with.
