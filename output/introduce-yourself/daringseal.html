hello all!<br/><br/>im a software engineer by trade but very interested in forward looking programming languages as a hobby.<br/><br/>im not sure exactly how i stumbled across this slack, but i have been lurking the programminglanguages subreddit for awhile and believe i saw it linked there.<br/><br/>i was drawn to the topic of programming language design and theory by my experimentation with haskell over the years, and the intense curiosity i found in the haskell community for pushing the language to its limits. since then i have consistently been very drawn to various functional languages, particularly purely functional stuff. the recent thing that has been interesting me is algebraic effects, particularly in the ability system provided by <a href="http://unisonweb.org">unisonweb.org</a>. i have been doing some tentative explorations into a lambda calculus based language myself, drawing inspiration from haskell, unison, reasonml/ocaml, and to a lesser extent, idris, purescript, etc. the syntax will probably be somewhat divergent from the traditions of these languages, as i am interested in seeing how the lambda calculus can be made more approachable for people used to c, java, javascript, python, etc
