Hi All! I’ve created a new Domain Specific Language (DSL) for people to express “product definitions” of consumer products (apps+web apps), which can then be “compiled” into full running software, and a platform that actually generates the app builds, generates and hosts the backend and web apps etc.<br/><br/>My belief is that it is too hard to build consumer software today. This difficulty is in large part because we build at too low a level of abstraction. I believe we should raise the level of abstraction to the conceptual level for defining most features, and only write custom code for things that can’t be expressed at this high level. With that approach, we can compile the high-level abstraction to native UI for all platforms and make developing polished x-platform software ~1000X+ easier.<br/><br/>Would love any thoughts / feedback, and would love to find people interested in this space to collaborate with (and just raised some money to enable that)!<br/><br/><a href="https://www.notion.so/Intro-to-Sutro-raising-the-level-of-abstraction-for-programming-by-multiple-orders-of-magnitude-06f2566973714b3298d8f3cf0ad29c66">https://www.notion.so/Intro-to-Sutro-raising-the-level-of-ab&hellip;</a>

Hey <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Owen Campbell-Moore</span>, congrats on raising your round and all the progress so far!<br/>I believe we share the same vision of building a DSL for building (web) apps while still giving developers the flexibility to write their own code when needed -&gt; I am co-founder of <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/">https://wasp-lang.dev/</a>.<br/>We are aiming for a similar thing, but instead of going for a visual DSL (GUI) we are implementing a textual DSL (programming language) that is then also compiled into JS stack (for now).<br/><br/>We also recently raised a seed round so I think we are in a pretty similar position.<br/><br/>We are certainly in same space and therefore competitors to some degree, but I am actually much more excited to see other people believing in the same vision then I am afraid of competition :smile:, so I am looking forward to see how Sutro develops and let me know if I can help in any way.<br/><br/>Also happy to hear any thoughts / feedback on Wasp!

Likewise! Excited to see where Wasp goes, and good to finally connect since we’re in a similar space!

Fun product! Our long term at <a href="http://Story.ai">Story.ai</a> has some alignment, here. But we're somewhere in the middle between wasp and sutro, with a semi-structural text editing language as the medium.
