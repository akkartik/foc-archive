I've been lurking in the group for some weeks now and look forward to sharing a new gallery\/playground and other bits about calculang soon and hearing your feedback!\ncalculang is about a bunch of things, but fundamentally about separating numbers from programming so they can be visualized, followed, communicated and things that are relatively hard when mixed with general programming.\nBy itself it fits in the FP space too: everything is a pure function, and \"input inference\" is intended to make the functions (or 'formulas') flexible by removing the tedious threading of arguments. This is the only really technical thing and it's &lt;100 LOC and something I found really interesting to play with.\nSince I only care about pure numbers calculang should integrate with other programming languages to 'do things': mainly Javascript now (calculang transpiles into JS). + I'm beginning to do some things with Python maybe Julia.\nMy examples focus a lot on visualization and interactivity with numbers\/their models, which JS is well primed for, but needs to generalize better also like spreadsheets do.\nI look forward to sharing progress and to learning from the community! :grinning:",
