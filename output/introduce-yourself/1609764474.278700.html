Hello Channel,<br/><br/>I am Shubhadeep. Indian by birth and presently living in Paris (moving to India in Feb 2021). I have been working as CTO of Codist for the last one year and half (EF pre-seed funded). We have been working on Machine Learning on Source Code and built amazing open source products including docly (Auto document your python code), tree-hugger (Universal Source Code mining platform), CodeBERT (a transformer model, pre-trained on code corpus).<br/><br/>Before that I have been working on Very Large Scale data Engineering and Machine Learning in Companies such as Kpler (Paris), Ubble (Paris), Mammoth Analytics (SF/Bangalore), Experience Commerce (presently part of Samsung) etc.<br/><br/>I have really wide range of experience and expertise. Some of them<br/><br/>- Vast ML and DL skills including clear understanding about the theory behind (Created product from scratch which is Open Source and used by more than 500 active users in less than three months)<br/>- Data Engineering (Beam, Spark, Kafka, AWS, GCP, Elasticsearch)<br/>- Dev-ops (Docker, K8S, ECS, Ansible)<br/>- Programming Language (Python, Go, C++, Rust, Javascript)<br/>- REST API, Scrapping, Architecture Design<br/>- Building and maintaining a team, mentoring them<br/>- Internationally published author in Data Science <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/data-wrangling-with-python/9781789800111">https://www.packtpub.com/product/data-wrangling-with-python/9781789800111</a><br/>- Highly popular tech blogger - <a href="https://medium.com/@rcshubha">https://medium.com/@rcshubha</a><br/><br/>Some of my profiles / Other online presence -<br/><br/>Github - <a href="https://github.com/rcshubhadeep">https://github.com/rcshubhadeep</a><br/>Stackoverflow - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1587118/src#">https://stackoverflow.com/users/1587118/src#</a><br/>Linkedin - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubhadeep-roychowdhury/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubhadeep-roychowdhury/</a><br/>Youtube - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d-w3cx2TlU&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d-w3cx2TlU&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> (my talk on Machine Learning on Source Code in a very popular DS channel)<br/><br/>What am Looking for? -<br/><br/>With a heavy heart I have to bid goodbye to Codist. We did all we could. But despite being good engineers / scientists, we were not good sellers. So at the end we accepted the reality that we are out of money and no-one is yet ready to invest (Oh you, God d**n COVID!). So, I am looking to get a suitable senior position (CTO, Lead Data Scientist, Senior ML Engineer etc.)  in a well funded start-up.<br/><br/>I am ready to join whenever is good for you.<br/><br/>I will be fully remote (unless you have office in Goa, India)<br/><br/>Contractual or normal job both welcome. But I am mainly looking for financial  reward more than ESOP kind of things.<br/><br/>I have worked in remote first teams for a good part of my life, so don't worry I know what I am doing.<br/><br/>I can always adjust my schedule with you.<br/><br/>I will be travelling in Feb so there will be a period of about three weeks when I won't be working. (I can start after that, if that suits you better)<br/><br/>I am more than happy to have a virtual coffee with you if you think that is worth it. And I am looking forward to join an exciting organisation, solving a meaningful and challenging problem.<br/><br/>I am also attaching my CV with this message. And I wish you all a very happy new year ahead! :tada:
