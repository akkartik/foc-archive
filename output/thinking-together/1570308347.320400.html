Yep, there are valid reasons to prioritize things other than simplicity, like performance (in appropriate applications) or verifiability, e.g.<br/><br/>The point, though, is that I don't think there is a single system on Earth (yet) that is effective at offering the capability of "general purpose programming" with a minimum of cognitive friction, and the big question is "why hasn't that happened yet?" <br/><br/>I'm doing my best to remedy that as we speak, though!
