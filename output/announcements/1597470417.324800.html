<b>Welcome to #announcements!</b><br/><br/>This channel is now the home for posts that deserve everyone's attention. For example: the fact that most of the channels were just renamed, and there are some new channels (#random-encounters, #present-company).<br/><br/>I have added (almost) everyone to this channel, and set it to be one of the default channels for new members. If you'd like, you can leave, but I'd prefer if you didn't — this is where new community initiatives will be announced, so it'd be worth keeping half an eye here if you'd like to participate in those.<br/><br/>• If you have an important announcement that <em>everyone</em> should see, you can post it here. Please be very conservative in how you post here. I'd like to see only about 1 post per week on average, at most. If you're unsure of whether to post here or in one of the other channels, feel free to DM me or ask in #administrivia.<br/>• This channel can continue to be used for job offers and requests for employment. If these get too noisy, we'll spin them off to a dedicated channel again — but they've been pretty sparse so far, and it's good that everyone see them.
