It won't magically solve your problems, but it does point out a glimpse of hope for the future. It's one of those days in the life of a computational scientist. Your desktop computer is busy updating its operating system and doesn't have any time left for you. The installation of your favorite simulation software on the new supercomputer doesn't advance beyond an error message extending over 500 lines. And your data analysis hasn't made much progress either: the results change when you use more or fewer processors, which doesn't look right. You already asked Siri for advice, but as so often is the case, that conversation led absolutely nowhere. Computers are complex, frustrating machines. If only we could have simple ones that just did what we tell them to do! Maybe it's a good idea to go back to the basics. Ever heard of Turing machines? They were invented in 1937 by Alan Turing, 1 and they're as simple as computers can get. No keyboard, no screen, no hard disk-no operating system either, nor any voices pestering you. You write your instructions on a tape, put the tape into the machine, and push a button. The machine starts working, moving the tape back and forth. When it stops, you take out the tape again and read off the result. Computing couldn't be simpler! Turing invented the machine that was later named after him as a purely theoretical concept. There wasn't much real computing hardware available back then, but people eventually built physical realizations (<http:\/\/www.legoturingmachine.org\/lego-turing-machine|www.legoturingmachine.org\/lego-turing-machine>, <http:\/\/aturingmachine.com>, and",

                "text": "Conway's law is an adage stating that organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structure. It is named after computer programmer Melvin Conway, who introduced the idea in 1967. His original wording was:\n\norganizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.\n\nThe law is based on the reasoning that in order for a software module to function, multiple authors must communicate frequently with each other. Therefore, the software interface structure of a system will reflect the social boundaries of the organization(s) that produced it, across which communication is more difficult. Conway's law was intended as a valid sociological observation, although sometimes it's used in a humorous context. It was dubbed Conway's law by participants at the 1968 National Symposium on Modular <http:\/\/Programming.In|Programming.In> colloquial terms, it means software or automated systems end up \"shaped like\" the organizational structure they are designed in or designed for. Some interpretations of the law say this organizational pattern mirroring is a helpful feature of such systems, while other interpretations say it's merely a result of human nature or organizational bias.",
