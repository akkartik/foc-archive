I wanted to make a pit stop at this tug-of-war example from <a href="https://probmods.org/chapters/conditioning.html">ProbMods</a> before I moved on to working on the code editor because it's one of the most eye-opening in terms of what's possible in PPLs, and because <em>this</em> is the visual I wanted that I couldn't get in WebPPL, in two ways: 1) all the plots, arranged how I wanted them, and 2) always-on plots that let me see the samples as they come in, with the charts getting smoother and smoother the longer I'm willing to wait.
