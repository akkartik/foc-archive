Hey everyone! :wave:<br/>My name is Guido Woda, and I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm a Uni dropout of Sound Engineering and Software Engineering, but have been working in software since 2006 nevertheless.<br/>I've always had a particular interest in software design and architecture and I've focused my career mostly on web-based enterprise products. But in the last few years I've struggled to find meaning in being a <em>cog in the machine</em>, so I started to feel disconnected from the craft and eventually burned out and took a necessary time off. Last year (2024) I got back into the industry, but during my time off I found that I enjoyed working on creative collaborative projects, and I didn't want to lose this. So a few months ago I started looking for content creators that could get me to reconnect to the craft, and that's how I found the podcast and this community! :blush:<br/><br/>I'm really enjoying everything I read here and listen on the podcast. I don't know how yet, but I'd love to be able to contribute someday :heart_hands:
