I've found it most essential to have a reasonably well-bounded end state. You can't "win" if you don't know what winning is. Whether it's some idea that I want reify (or find out of someone else has already realized it), or it's a particular pain that my company (or society/civilization) is feeling that I'd like to remove, or something I want to learn just to keep abreast of technology and our culture, I think it's key to define a goal condition for your research-like activity, as specifically as you can manage.<br/><br/>A really helpful yardstick I've found when approaching learning material (papers, blog posts, talks, books, etc) is to determine if something is or isn't going to be <b>pabulum</b> — intellectual, thought-provoking, informative, but ultimately bland and <em>entertaining</em> to me, rather than <em>helpful</em> to me. This is a very difficult determination to make in the absence of a specific goal.<br/><br/>I also find it's valuable to do whatever I can to make sure I'm highly excited about what I'm working on. That might be a luxury not everyone can afford, but I think we're all here in this Slack because of some measure of mutual passion, so I think it's safe to take this value as a given here. Enthusiasm is what determines how I structure my time at a fine-grained level — "What small step toward my end goal am I most excited about taking next?" The pabulum filter + specific end goal keeps me from treading water, while this "chase your curiosity" approach keeps the work from becoming monotonous. One day I might make a paper prototype. Then I might decide that paper lacks "liveness", so I grab a stop-motion app and make an animated paper prototype. Then I might decide that I really need to interact with the system, so I ask my wife to help me "act out" the HCI, moving the paper pieces around according to some ruleset. After refining the ruleset, I have something structured enough to prototype in Keynote or hypertext. In each of these steps, I'm doing work that I need to do, but in a way that keeps me away from writing code, since today I'm less excited about writing code than I am about (say) scissors.<br/><br/>That's my recipe.<br/><li> Be excited to go somewhere.<br/><li> Be sure you're always moving in that direction.<br/><li> And be absolutely sure there's a "there" there.
