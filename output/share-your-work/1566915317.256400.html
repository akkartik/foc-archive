as far as I know most drawing pipelines (I'm not an expert here) go through different stages with different representations that make it easy to do the operations that are important at that stage, so the best representation depends on where you are and what you want to do, I don't think you can avoid going from one represenation to the other unless you want to operate in a represenation that is not the most adapted to the task at hand
