Hello everyone,<br/><br/>My name is Hemi Edwards. I'm a computing and technology enthusiast from Aotearoa/New Zealand. I am indigenous and belong to the Rongowhakaata tribe of the Maori. We occupy our ancestral lands on the East Coast of Aotearoa/New Zealand, though we have lost much in the process of colonization. We have too gained much from our engagement with the rest of the world. For most of us our primary language is English but there have been efforts to revitalize our indigenous language of Te Reo Maori, for the last 50 years. Many other indigenous peoples see our success as an inspiration for the rejuvenation of their own traditional languages and I believe that digital technologies offer much to support this mission. Speaking English grants us opportunities to meaningfully engage with the wider work, especially in forums like this where we can learn about new possibilities and ways to think and interact with the physical world.<br/><br/>I have been familiar with Bret Victor's work for some years now and have been excited about the potential for these new approaches to make computer interactions more meaningful, embodied, and accessible than currently. This is really important especially when it comes to economically deprived and socially marginalized communities like my people, who lost much from colonization and whose experience in the traditional school system was specifically intended to stunt our development as individuals and as a people. This has had ongoing generational impacts for my people. Language revitalization is just one aspect of current efforts to close the gaps in terms of learning achievement, equitable economic participation, and development of personal and social capacity.
