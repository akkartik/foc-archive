Just saw this too.. another attempt at 100x but they have no details from what I can see.

i gather from the prior work of the founders that this is a server side technology, in that sense probably more like Dark language. The odd thing is that it is built in Clojure, but doesn't mention a language at all, so i infer that this project is about facilitating setting up server clusters, offering dashboards, scripting, failover control, etc. so more like an evolution of the tools AWS offers, but not proprietary to Amazon. This is of course a guess, but if you have been doing research for years, and haven't come up with a language, you probably didn't have the intention of creating one in the first place.<br/><br/>I don't consider a toolchain that doesn't include a language to be a major breakthrough. Without creating a new era of interchangeable parts, you haven't gone to the next gen IMHO

in a HN comment the founder said that it will be implemented in clojure but will expose a java api

Java is the COBOL of our time. I hope they aren't trying to help Java continue its shambolic journey into the living graveyard of languages alongside COBOL and FORTRAN. Old languages never die, they get maintained indefinitely as their artifacts have business value, but very little new gets created in COBOL and FORTRAN today. This is one of many reasons i hate the TIOBE index, as it measures rotting dead carcasses by the pound as if that mattered to someone writing something today, and thus discriminates against super potent languages like ClojureScript and highly productive tools like Corona, or Adobe AIR, VB6 or Delphi. The better the tool, the shorter the program, and thus any non-verbose technology always looks like it is receding in market share when in fact less code is good!
