One alternative to an idea maze for sorting ourselves may be for each of us to list principles, so that we can build up some sort of adjacency matrix to figure out who overlaps most with us. Here's a list for myself I came up with after chatting with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Peter Abrahamsen</span> last week, trying to be opinionated rather than bland:<br/><br/>• Longevity over adoption.<br/>• Implementation matters.<br/>   - Transparency over abstraction.<br/>   - Minimize dependencies. No, <em>really</em>.<br/>   - Minimize number of languages used.<br/>   - Conciseness of language is secondary.<br/>• Rewarding curiosity about implementation should be a first-class design goal.<br/>   - Doesn’t matter what the architecture is; <em>can others tell</em> what the architecture is?<br/>   - Encode knowledge first about the outside. Environment/context over algorithms. (tests)<br/>   - Encode knowledge in the repo. No other place to look at. “Don’t make me talk to you.”<br/>   - Knowledge automatically complains when it goes out of date. (tests)<br/>   - Keep it easy to update. (domain-independent traces over domain-specific immediate UIs)<br/>   - Organize knowledge autobiographically, in a cleaned up version history. (layers)<br/>• Make it tractable to delete features.<br/>   - Encourage more forks.<br/>• Don’t charge for software. Messes with long-term incentives. (Charging for hosting/operational services is ok.)<br/><br/>Comments most appreciated. I also worry that I'm too verbose in my comments, so feel free to tell me that :slightly_smiling_face:

Interesting to consider what principles we as a community generally feel are guiding, which might but don't actually matter, and those about which we tend to have split opinion.  For example, let me venture a few guesses:  we all feel liveness is important, that types (and type theories) aren't so much, and that there's differing opinions about ease of learning.

I'm actually a counter-example on liveness and direct-feedback UI. It's something to aim for for sure in the fullness of time. But I think the things I mentioned above are higher priority.<br/><br/>A more parsimonious stack would have a much easier time implementing <em>and sustaining</em> a direct-feedback interface.

Great!  When making any claim, this is the kind of feedback one hopes for.  To learn whether there's a more subtle core value that may manifest differently.

For example, easy to learn vs powerful for the master is probably a false dichotomy.  What may be a real difference is whether, in a given dimension, the programming tool should extend to meet a person's existing mental model or whether the tool should help facilitate a person in learning a new mental model.

For example, layout in memory is kind of an implementation detail that a good environment would help you to mostly if not entirely ignore.  Whereas relationships between entities (how many these are there per one of those in this or that context), might be the kind of thing we want the tool to help make explicit.

This could be a large difficult task, but I think the payoff is worth it.<br/><br/>My prediction is that there'd be <b>many</b> different dimensions and goals that would not all fit into clear categories, with lots of overlap and probably spanning multiple unrelated "spaces". There are even different categories of categories: topics, goals, perspectives, mechanisms, tools, languages, features, change for programmers vs change for users/society, etc.<br/><br/>However, I think if we do it best to lay it out (expecting a very broad mess of info), we can then start to identify very clear recurring themes of goals, etc., and that could be powerful.

Also, I suspect that although we'd probably find a diverse spread of ideas at the top, we'd probably find some very concrete underlying motives -- and that's more powerful than comparing ideas for ideas sake.<br/><br/>For example, I want to code visualized, but you want to see code as spread sheets -- but maybe we both really just want code to be more immediately understandable.<br/><br/>And that can get deeper: <b>why</b> does code need to be more understandable? Anyway, we might be about to dig down and down to get at what we really care most about, and then compare "branches" off common roots. That might allow for more meaningful cross-influence (and purpose) than comparing features for features sake (I say "features", but whatever else it may be).<br/><br/>Anyway, potentially big task, and it might not be perfect; but in all seriousness, maybe we should try to make a "tree" or commonality? (roots being underlying motives or problems, etc.)

With that in mind, there's also the whole category of topics / projects for making that kind collaboration (or whatever other kinds we might be doing here) better. Ways of visualizing and sharing info, etc. I mean, maybe there are good enough tools; but do you ever think that even <b>working</b> on working on improving software (or whatever you call it) should be better than is otherwise normally given to us?

Ha, I can bring this right back to the C.A. topic of "living structure" (LS), in that a thing that generates LS (referring to the kinds of things/changes we want to create) must itself be LS (referring to whatever collaborative process we might undertake).<br/><br/>In other words, it's not going to happen by finding the right tool or process all at once, but by finding some initial setup/process for "bootstrapping" the rest of it into existence (i.e. "unfolding wholeness" through "structure preserving transformations" -- where perhaps "structure" can mean "process", e.g. how we go about collaborating or documenting / sharing / building off of each other's ideas &amp; goals)

That's interesting. You wrote<br/>&gt; Minimize dependencies<br/>&gt; Minimize number of languages used<br/>&gt; Encourage more forks<br/>where I would probably have written the opposite in my list of principles. Could you elaborate why you chose these principles? Thanks in advance :wink:

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Felix Kohlgrüber</span>: Yeah, I was explicitly trying to focus on areas where I'm likely to disagree with most people. Giving the <tt>diff</tt>s, as it were. That way if someone agreed with me, that would be a very strong signal indeed.<br/><br/>All three stem from my basic focus: on rewarding the curiosity of outsiders to a codebase. And that focus splits up into a long-term and a short-term component. In the long term, I think conventional wisdom in those three areas has costs that society consistently ignores. Somebody should explore the other side. In the short term, the prototype I'm building needs all three properties to reliably falsify my hypotheses.<br/><br/>• <em>Minimize dependencies</em>: because most libraries today are unreliable/leaky, they make it harder for newcomers to tell where to look for answers to certain questions, and they give worse answers ("this function should give this answer but gives this instead", vs "version x of Foo is incompatible with version y of Bar")<br/><br/>• <em>Minimize languages</em>: because every language used by a project adds to the burden of prerequisites a reader has to know before they can make the small change they care about.<br/><br/>• <em>Encourage forking</em>: because at a fundamental level what runs on my laptop has no reason to be identical to what the rest of the world runs. Ease of upgrading and merging are secondary concerns. They still need to be solved, yes, and I'm working on that. But <em>designing</em> the way we distribute software to make upgrading easy seems like the tail wagging the dog. My system is harder to comprehend because the hard disk drivers on it are also optimized for running high-throughput servers. It's also harder to get changes that help <em>me</em> merged upstream because the authors care less about my use case. Why not just have a fork that caters to a smaller segment of the market that is more like me, and drop all the bloat that we don't need?
