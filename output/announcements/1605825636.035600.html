Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span>. Nice to (virtually) meet you. I'm the Lead PI on this grant proposal. Glad you're excited about this. I'm excited about the decision to include FoC. There will be a lot of work in these last few days to have all the materials together by Sunday night.

Thanks for joining, Russ! I'm excited to work with you on this. There's a lot of enthusiasm and energy in this community. It feels especially rewarding whenever we manage to catch the attention of someone outside and make a positive impression. If we win this funding, of course, it'll help us do quite a bit more of that I'm sure.<br/><br/>(One note about our "<a href="https://futureofcoding.org/member-handbook">house style</a>" here in this Slack, which is worth knowing if you'll be participating in the community at all, which I hope you do :) â€” when replying to messages, use threads as much as you can. We have some automated systems that build up a searchable <a href="http://history.futureofcoding.org">archive</a>. Nesting replies ties together our discussions for easier reference.)
