She also refers to the \"tools for thought\" community (which we are related to) as something that could turn into an idea machine.\n\n<https:\/\/nadia.xyz\/idea-machines>\n\nI think our community is fairly close to being an \"idea machine\". We are missing some *funders* (though we do have some), as well as a shared *agenda* (though we do have some). I personally intuit that we're just a small amount of branding (I never liked the name \"future of coding\" all that much, and yes I came up with it) away from the status of the \"tools for thought\" or even the \"effective altruism\" communities. I feel like our community needs to be easier to \"point to\" in the way one can point to EA.\n\nAny suggestions on branding or other structural changes we could do as a community to become more effective?",
