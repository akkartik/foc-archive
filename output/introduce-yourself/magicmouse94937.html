Hi, i am Edward de Jong. I have been programming almost daily since 1970. I have gone from mainframes, to mini-computers, to workstations, to desktop computers, to mobile devices. Built mostly graphical interactive products, for either business or education. Original author of WordStar 2000, IBM DisplayWrite 5/ Composer, Flying Colors, Discus labeler, and about 100 iPhone titles.

I am the default leader of the next-gen language developer's association, and try to coordinate and communicate with the key members of the development teams who are working on the next generation language, which includes Parasail, Red, Luna, Beads, Elm, Chapel, etc.  It is a very competitive situation, but since inertia is the most powerful force in the universe, we new language enthusiasts need to stick together enough to get the masses to realize that there is a major problem out there, and that JavaScript (a blatant but uncredited copy of Macromedia's ActionScript 2) is not the end-state.

welcome to the group. There is no question that better languages can drastically simplify programming, and that a much larger number of personality types can enjoy programming once this grand simplification occurs. I find at present, programming is restricted to people who could do a 5000 piece jigsaw puzzle. That takes a very special kind of persistence, patience, and strong pattern recognition skills. Most puzzles sold are in the 300 / 500 / 1000 piece sizes, and many stores don't even stock a 5000 piece jigsaw.

i am working myself on something that would be ideal for coding camps, and i look forward to the field test where i test it on 12 year olds and 70 year olds. Both groups are excluded at present, and the seniors have the most to offer because they know what should be built, while kids typically only know games.

would be interested in how one adds a new language to syntax highlighting for VS Code. Some of the new languages being developed are textual and even many of the graphical ones have a textual output, so making it clearer how one gets syntax highlighting and of even more integration with VS Code, which is a very well received editor, would be helpful.  People develop strong preferences for specific editors, and all younger programmers are used to partial completion suggestions and coloration.

welcome to the group. there are many members in the bay area, and if you want some advice from a grizzled veteran you can meet up for some boba tea...

You have done such a great job of making things pretty, and routing the wires nicely. But I think you have picked the wrong level of abstraction to diagram. You are drawing the microscopic local variables, yet in a program like Snake or TicTacToe (see <a href="https://github.com/magicmouse/beads-examples">https://github.com/magicmouse/beads-examples</a><br/>), one has the core model stored in some data structure which holds the source of truth, which for TicTacToe might be whose turn it is, what is in the 9 cells of the grid, etc., then you have the layout of the screen, which has its own data structures, and then you have user input events, which are not data but a stream of inputs driving the finite state machine of the game. There is negligible computation in this example, and if you diagram the functions you would make it less understandable. I like visual tools, but diagramming local variables and formal parameter inputs is too low level IMHO. Lots of things one could draw nicely, but the low level computation is perhaps the least interesting thing to show.

welcome to the group, there are lots of interesting projects here, be sure to check out the spreadsheet showing all the different efforts underway to build the FoC.
