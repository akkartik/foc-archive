<b>PODCAST</b><br/>I'm working on new episodes! The first will come out in January. I'm hoping to keep a monthly cadence thereafter. The biggest constraint will be time — it currently takes me over 20 hours to make each episode — so I might adjust plans or process as we go. That said, I'm going to do everything in my power (as a music-person who owns a lot of microphones and fancy editing software, haha) to push the production quality of the podcast up to "professional" levels. (If you someday hear theme music, don't bristle — it's going to happen.) I'm also interested in trying out other formats, in addition to the "interview" and "research recap" episode styles Steve patterned. If you have suggestions for programming, production, formatting, ideal episode length, etc — I'm all ears. I've got a slate of guests lined up that I'm really excited to share with you, but I'd also like to keep the podcast very closely associated with our community. If you would like to come on the podcast to talk about your FoC project, shoot me a DM and I'll add your name to the list. Like many of you, I came to this community in the first place because of the podcast, and I'm honoured that Steve asked me to take up the torch. I'll do my best to keep the spirit intact while improving the things I can improve and despite losing Steve's unique perspective. Yes, that means more talk of visual programming than before. Yes, I will make a sincere effort to give static typing its due :slightly_smiling_face:

20 hours per month… Crossing my fingers against burnout and competition with other projects! Are you planning to start a Patreon as Steve said you might?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> thank you for taking on the stewardship of this community. Having this community humming along is super valuable and I (and I assume everyone else here) really appreciate the time and effort you have decided to put into it.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tom Lieber</span> Yeah, 20 hours is a lot, but I'm hoping that'll improve once I settle on a good process. As for Patreon, we'll see. It'd be nice if the podcast were able to bring in enough money to pay for itself (hosting, transcript, and maybe a little for my effort). <a href="http://Repl.it">Repl.it</a> have been a big help so far. But I'm sensitive to subscription fatigue being a thing, so there might be better options than Patreon — for instance, a second sponsor. I welcome any thoughts or suggestions, here or in DMs.

Hi Ivan, I talked with steve a bit about Interviewing Juan benet. I sent him some questions and we had a bit of discussion around that topic. Do you have a dashboard or some kind of collaboration tool beyond email where I can contribute? Do You think it would be possible to get Juan on the podcast? If so I would love to be part of that interview in some way or another.
