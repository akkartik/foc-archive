I am very interested in positions against what they argue to make up my mind of how profound their ideas really are, and being left to my own (and at this point fairly biased) interpretations probably means I’m at risk to overlook something.\n\nSo far, however, I only hear criticisms that seem to be rooted in the fear that the authors take some possibility away. I tend to see their attempt in differentiating algorithmic (both symbolic and stochastic) models from a totally different constraint-based dynamical systems approach that provides characteristics that the computational approach can’t as a revelatory insight that, while perhaps putting algorithmic approaches in their slightly more restricted place, doesn’t at all prevent those approaches from continuing to improve their approximations of reality. Which maps nicely to what’s happening in AI, mostly by increasing complexity in the form of increasing both data and compute. That probably also explains why I find their point about computation rather minor, <@UJBAJNFLK>.\n\nAt the same time it paves the way for a new and different path of exploration that tries to integrate human cognition, which I personally find much more refreshing than the “If we just throw enough data and compute at it” approaches that are so en vogue in AI currently. There’s lots of space (and tons more resources, apparently) to build more and better models the “classic” way. I don’t think anyone is trying to take that away. However, there is also a refined understanding of an alternative path emerging, that seems (to me at least) to be based in good science.\n\nOf course, I am an enthusiastic amateur at best, and my judgement of how good the science is means nothing to anybody else. But having spent a lot of time with some of the adjacent research, mainly relevance realization (Vervaeke) and constraint-based meta-stability in complex dynamical systems (Juarrero), there is something here that endlessly fascinates me.
