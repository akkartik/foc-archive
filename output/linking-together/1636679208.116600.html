Speaking of interfaces, this video of various Mac team members introducing MacPaint and MacWrite (with rapturous audience reactions) is priceless. Especially delightful is the Q&amp;A, which starts around halfway through the video. Through the video, you get a good sense of a few things:<br/>• Features of MacWrite and MacPaint you might not have figured out for yourself when playing with them as a 5 year old.<br/>• What particular aspects of these apps were surprising / delightful to a very tech-savvy audience.<br/>• What particular aspects of these apps are seen as "<em>the thing</em>" by various Mac team members<br/>• What sorts of technical and design tradeoffs the team made (becomes especially apparent in the Q&amp;A)<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqQJ-VnJ2uc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqQJ-VnJ2uc</a>
