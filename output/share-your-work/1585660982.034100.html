Hey everyone! A while ago I have shared video of short presentation about generic tree editor (Towards efficient development tools).<br/><br/>Since then I got some progress, recorded a video demo to document it.<br/>I would be glad to receive feedback: <a href="https://youtu.be/KOHNUtw8h5o">https://youtu.be/KOHNUtw8h5o</a>

at the end you mention that you would like to develop a small functional programming language to experiment with it, wouldn't it be faster and more focused to use scheme/fennel or even a language like lambdu or hazel instead of adding an extra project?

I was thinking about adopting this editor to Scheme. Then I realized that to demonstrate some cool features that structure-stored code provides it would require to modify Scheme, it likely won't be standard-compliant.

adopting a subset of an existing language will save you a lot of time and also will make it easier for others to understand what's going on since they won't have to understand a new tool and a new language at the same time. Also it may get more adopted if the language it supports has existing users

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mariano Guerra</span> I think I clearly understand what are you talking about and I agree with you.<br/><br/>I am not planning to create a language that will get widely adopted. That's not the goal. Instead I just want to explore possible features that structure-based source code editing may provide.<br/><br/>It think that target audience of this project are not actual programmers, but programming language enthusiasts, basically future of coding people. I would like to create platform for experiments.<br/><br/>I certainly would like to adopt to this editor platform something familiar like Scheme and make development more convenient than usual relying on structure-based source code.

if you want to explore possible features for a structure-based source code editor, then what better than the requirements enforced by existing languages? I'm not saying to support all, but you can pick and chose from a really restricted subset and grow from there. If you want to explore what a language designed from the ground up to be a first class citizen on that type of editors, then creating a language may be part of the project, but you mention that your editor plans to be generic, so supporting existing languages and formats saves you time and gets wider audience

my feedback is just because I see promise in your idea and I think that the new language idea would take energy and focus from the main activity, you may run out of energy/time or get to a dead end just because you decided to attack two problems at the same time

Your comments really made me think, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mariano Guerra</span>. I even went for a short walk to sort things out with clear head. Thank you for that!<br/><br/>I realized that making a platform for experiments for others is my secondary goal. My actual first goal is to implement vision of convenient programming that I have. Generic tree editor is just a step towards it.<br/><br/>If creating a platform generic structure editing was the only goal, then indeed I should work with existing structure-based programming languages, make it convenient to edit code written in them. But for now that is my secondary goal.<br/><br/>For my first goal I need flexibility from both sides: on the editor side, on the programming language design side. If I rely on existing programming languages I lose freedom on one side. Lamdu and Unison do not look like thing that I have in mind.

I’m working on a project that has some overlap with your ideas. But it’s still in a really early stage, so I don’t have much to show rn.<br/>2 questions:<br/>• Do you have a grammar for how are you storing AST’s?<br/>• Are you storing the text in files? I’m playing with storing the AST’s in a database<br/>Cool video <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Vladimir Gordeev</span>!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Daniel Garcia</span> Thanks!<br/><br/>No grammar, I just store DAG as it is. Just like when you store JSON you don't use any grammar.<br/><br/>Right now I store it in browser's key-value localStorage. I calculate hash for each node, hash serves as a key. Pretty much the same way Git stores its DAGs.

Nice demo. I always have way more respect for tools that scale arbitrarily, as this one does. It feels serious and not a toy built for a demo.<br/><br/>One possible improvement would be a zoomed out overview of where you are in the whole tree, similar to Sublime Text's zoomed out document in the top right. You could click that to make massive jumps quickly without going all the way up and all the way down again.<br/><br/>I personally like to know "where I am" globally at a glance, it helps me organise stuff in my head

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Daniel Garcia</span> Maybe slack comment is not the best place to put it. I'll share what I can get from the top of my head.<br/><br/>Some of what I am writing here I have shared in my presentation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8UH3DjvxDE&amp;t=37s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8UH3DjvxDE&amp;t=37s</a><br/><br/>Some general principles:<br/><br/>1. Too much expressiveness is bad -- turns programming into Chaos (like Lisp macro hell). Too much restriction is also bad -- turns programming into a prison of Order (try to do complicated IO in Haskell). To get comfortable PL we need to walk a fine line between these Order and Chaos, to balance PL design. Many design decisions that I make just shift balance of Order and Chaos to make users less overwhelmed.<br/>2. Programmers develop software through observe-modify-repeat loop in their heads. To make programming easy and efficient we need to optimize this loop. Make observation of the change fast, make modification safe and painless.<br/>Some technical ideas:<br/><br/>1. Actors with isolated memory and communication by copying messages (from Erlang) -- brilliant idea that makes programming a lot easier. When it is guaranteed that this piece of code is influenced by these several inputs it is a lot easier to debug and reproduce it. This is absolutely necessary and should be as widespread as use of pure functions.<br/>2. Application is basically a composition of many actors that message each other. During execution some actors might be spawned and killed as needed. This is very powerful and possible compositions might be quite overwhelming. To shift this situation towards Order I want to restrict possible compositions: it should be a regular tree.<br/>3. One powerful data structure for almost everything: DAG. Pattern matching helps a lot with all kinds of manipulation. If an actor provides an interface of a DAG, it should be possible to pattern match against it. This way you can walk database, filesystem or web service in similar manner you would walk local DAG. <br/>4. Test cases of input and expected output are attached directly to the function, it is part of the annotation. This makes it very easy to modify it -- tests for this particular function would run over and over. Precondition and postcondition code is part of the function. They help to distinguish bad input and error in the code, which helps to make IDE convenient. This feature is a lot easier to implement for structure-based source code.

I agree with all of these except the focus on pure functions. You’ll also need some form of resumable stacks (such as coroutines) within your actors to write readable code this way.

A coroutine is a lightweight cooperative thread. An example use might be waiting on asynchronous operations (like i/o) without loosing the state you’ve built up in your call stack - as you’d end up having to construct an even more complex (and likely inscrutable) state machine otherwise. So when you make your call to wait on an i/o operation, behind the scenes it sets aside your current stack and continues some other coroutine (or returns to the event loop). When the i/o operation event occurs, that callback resumes (switches to) the previously paused coroutine’s stack. In this way, you can writing asynchronous code as if it were synchronous, while still being aware of where those points are via things like naming conventions on methods that may pause the coroutine. You can also yield coroutines at safe points so they can do long running computations with stacks.

Hi Vladimir, you mentioned several times that you use a DAG data structure. However the examples in your videos are all trees. Do you have any examples that benefit from the sub-tree sharing that characterizes DAGs?

Hey <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span>!<br/><br/>The trees that are shown in the video were stored as a DAG with hashes as keys (just like in Git), if same tree node is used in several places, only one instance is stored. However, for now this reuse is not displayed in UI in any way.<br/><br/>Actually, I am not sure I understand about which benefits exactly you are talking. I have following thoughts in mind:<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>It is good to show that some subtree is used somewhere else. This way you can explore how this or that function is used in other places.<br/><br/>For example we have following DAG:<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">place1:<br/>  subtree1: {foobar: baz}<br/>place2:<br/>  subtree2: {foobar: baz}</pre><br/>We can somehow display connection between <tt>subtree1</tt> and <tt>subtree2</tt> and navigate from one to the other.<br/><br/>However, if user decides to modify <tt>place1/subtree1</tt>, then editor should allow it for the sake of good user experience. It should feel like text and should not break things in other parts of the system by default. Thus, this connection between subtrees will be broken, because they are not equal anymore.<br/><br/>To have subtrees that are actually pointing to one thing and change simultaneously I plan to use explicit references to a subtree, for example:<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">references-list-keyword:<br/>  ref1: {foobar: baz}<br/>place1:<br/>  subtree1: {reference-keyword: ref1}<br/>place2:<br/>  subtree2: {reference-keyword: ref1}</pre><br/>Tree editor should recognize this referencing and display references to the trees as actual trees (with some highlighting that would indicate referencing).<br/><br/>This referencing can be made nested, which would start to look like lexical scoping in many PLs.

For now DAG structure is not used for anything except storage saving, yes. Differences from simple trees may show up on the level above, in PL.<br/><br/>For example you have two different functions that expect trees with two different interfaces:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">func1(Value):<br/>  {title: S} = Value<br/>  do_something(S)<br/><br/>func2(Value):<br/>  {asString: S} = Value<br/>  do_something(S)</pre><br/>Because we work with dags we can create a value that satisfies both interfaces with single value:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">asString: "a string value"<br/>title: "a string value"</pre><br/>Or, because it is a DAG, we can display it like that:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">asString:<br/>   title: "a string value"</pre><br/>Two keys, but one value.<br/><br/>That kind of thing will be really useful only on PL level, which I haven't reached yet.

I didn't really. I asked about benefits because you mentioned the power of a DAG several times in the video.<br/><br/>The space savings don't seem very important. And since you don't use it yet in any externally visible way, I wonder if the complications this will cause in the UX are worth side-stepping for now.<br/><br/>The sense I'm getting is that you chose a content-addressable representation for trees that naturally ended up supporting DAGs. I might consider undoing that decision just to avoid having to jump through hoops to ensure that edits in one place don't affect other places. Just create a new id for every node, and never reuse nodes. Periodically garbage-collect if you need to, to save space. But really, disk is cheap.<br/><br/>Very interesting project! What are you building it in?

By default I expect people to change things in place and not affect anything else. But sometimes they will need to change something available by reference, which is less safe for user to do, becacause it can break things.

&gt; what happens if shared content is equal (as in identical content/hash), but doesn’t really represent the same thing<br/>I have a terrible thing in mind: I don't want to provide content addressability. Thus, this problem of equal hashes but not equal content is a problem inside single storage and can be resolved by some additional checks.<br/><br/>I want to deny content addressability because I want to work with trees that are not necessarily stored as DAG. As I mentioned in video, trees may represent file system or a database. Providing correct hash for a table that constantly changes might be a problem.

Thus, tree editor works with repository, that has arbitrary toplevel key-value entries.

Unrelated I was wondering about properties that hold collections: in the video you spend quite some time explaining that keys need to be unique and only the first value of each key will be stored. Have you considered turning multiple values for the same key into a collection? And if you did, what made you decide against it?

&gt; Have you thought about how that distinction can surface in the user interface?<br/>I don't have a ready sketch for that. What I know is that visually it will be very different, pretty much two different modes of editing.<br/><br/>Right now I am thinking to add a side window for editing data from reference.<br/><br/>&gt; Have you considered turning multiple values for the same key into a collection? And if you did, what made you decide against it?<br/>I wanted to use simplest possible data structure, from which everything else can be constructured.<br/><br/>I can express this:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">key1: value1<br/>key1: value2<br/>key1: value3</pre><br/>As this:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">key1:<br/>  0: value1<br/>  1: value2<br/>  3: value3</pre><br/>Allowing several values for same key may make UI for pattern matching much more complicated. It also adds ambiguity -- what if several values do fit the pattern?

I’d be really interested to learn more about the API. Would it be possible to specify a protocol in line with <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/</a> but where the AST is in focus and not the text file? More than just the editor I guess it would be possible to do better search, autocomplete and version control if the dependencies from each expression is known or even more fine grained incremental compilation. One important compromise I suppose you must have put some thought into is the requirements you put on the language in terms of order vs chaos to put it in your words.

Hey! Currently I store DAG in localStorage in browser, just for demo. I don't have ready API, I haven't designed it yet.<br/>Yeah, making API similar to LSP (or even just mostly copying it) is a great idea. It also may help the adoption. I will try to do that.<br/><br/>&gt; One important compromise I suppose you must have put some thought into is the requirements you put on the language in terms of order vs chaos to <br/>&gt; put it in your words.<br/>If you mean the language that I want to create than yes. Did I understood you correctly?<br/>I don't expect to create successful language on first attempt.<br/>I think about this generic tree editor as a platform for many different languages.

Good artists copy; great artists steal. :smile:  I think it might be hard to design an API that all languages can implement. Immutable variables might make it easier to compute up and downstream dependencies and if the order of the declarations doesn’t matter you could perhaps order them alphabetically or something like that. LSP is pretty nice in that you can choose what part of the API you support.
