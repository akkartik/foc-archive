I suppose the name \"future of coding\" is based on his \"future of programming\" talk, but as far as I can tell ignores that this title is (again, to my mind) clearly ironic - this (really excellent) talk was after all about the past.",

It's telling that the main reference is Bret Victor - of course I can't speak for him but as far as I can tell has pretty much disowned the programming community, or at least seems very disinterested in making tools for the currently existing community of programmers. I suppose the name \"future of coding\" is based on his \"future of programming\" talk, but as far as I can tell ignores that this title is (again, to my mind) clearly ironic - this (really excellent) talk was after all about the past."

Pretty much everyone agrees it's important in theory, but when it comes to important decisions (funding, hiring), interdisciplinarity always loses out. No need to invoke negative feelings to explain this, although you may be right about the specific situation in CS which I don't know, being in physics and chemistry myself. It's just group dynamics, of the same kind that creates obstacles to diversity elsewhere. Take a group of specialists from some disciplines, and let them discuss a project. The only aspects that they will all view favorably are the common aspects of their discipline, so that's what all projects have to adhere to.\nThe larger lesson is that opening up a group to be more inclusive (in whatever sense: social, thematic, ...) probably requires incentives coming from the outside.",

Pretty much everyone agrees it's important in theory, but when it comes to important decisions (funding, hiring), interdisciplinarity always loses out. No need to invoke negative feelings to explain this, although you may be right about the specific situation in CS which I don't know, being in physics and chemistry myself. It's just group dynamics, of the same kind that creates obstacles to diversity elsewhere. Take a group of specialists from some disciplines, and let them discuss a project. The only aspects that they will all view favorably are the common aspects of their discipline, so that's what all projects have to adhere to.\nThe larger lesson is that opening up a group to be more inclusive (in whatever sense: social, thematic, ...) probably requires incentives coming from the outside."

X over Y \n2. Y over X\n3. X and Y live in peace while keeping their identities separate and independant\n4. X intermixed with Y forming a new identity as XY\nI find that 1, 2, 4  create monocultures because the original identity is lost.  Ways in which groups can be separate yet  be totally co-operative are missing. When anthropologists go to a tribe, they don’t force their views on them ... they operate in 3.\nTo take programming languages as an example ... I am arguing for single paradigm languages without forcing every language to accommodate every style. Python doesn’t have types and that’s OK. Every community has strengths and I fear tying to create a “common community” is a bad attempt to create 1 language that is forced on everyone for their own “good”.  An organisation that uses multiple programming languages interacting via a common REST protocol is better than enforcing 1 language. While it looks inefficient, what I would like to point is that monocultures suck.",

Ways in which groups can be separate yet  be totally co-operative are missing. When anthropologists go to a tribe, they don’t force their views on them ... they operate in 3.\nTo take programming languages as an example ... I am arguing for single paradigm languages without forcing every language to accommodate every style. Python doesn’t have types and that’s OK. Every community has strengths and I fear tying to create a “common community” is a bad attempt to create 1 language that is forced on everyone for their own “good”.  An organisation that uses multiple programming languages interacting via a common REST protocol is better than enforcing 1 language. While it looks inefficient, what I would like to point is that monocultures suck."

This also ensures that each club can protect their group from intrusion and ensure its members are adequately protected, according their own needs decided democratically than by an external agent.\n\nEach club keeps their identity separate and is organised around group achievements rather than artificial guilt induced by selective readings of history.\n\nFrom my limited readings, this is something the Maori people have achieved to some degree. “White people” thinking they are Maori is silly at best and them trying to patronise and mother Maori is intrusive and unwarranted.\n\nThe guilt induced reading is a very narrow reading of history. UK was raped and enslaved by Romans and Vikings and the French and the Germans.  I would be more than happy to see UK and USA renamed to former slaves of the Romans and the French. English was considered a farmer’s language for quite sometime and the royalty spoke French but I digress.\n\nI am absolutely not against inclusivity but I feel that there is a net loss when each group’s natural integrity is lost and replaced by an all inclusive “supergroup” that is poorly thought out and forced because of mere “good intentions” .  The noble intentions of priests has done more harm than good, in many ways is the reason why we are in this mess the first place.\n\nIf I am not mistaken the Hacker ethic already proclaimed inclusivity as a corner stone. This chaotic but functional diversity is something we see in our programming tribes naturally and I wish more research was done in this area.",

This also ensures that each club can protect their group from intrusion and ensure its members are adequately protected, according their own needs decided democratically than by an external agent.\n\nEach club keeps their identity separate and is organised around group achievements rather than artificial guilt induced by selective readings of history.\n\nFrom my limited readings, this is something the Maori people have achieved to some degree. “White people” thinking they are Maori is silly at best and them trying to patronise and mother Maori is intrusive and unwarranted.\n\nThe guilt induced reading is a very narrow reading of history. UK was raped and enslaved by Romans and Vikings and the French and the Germans.  I would be more than happy to see UK and USA renamed to former slaves of the Romans and the French. English was considered a farmer’s language for quite sometime and the royalty spoke French but I digress.\n\nI am absolutely not against inclusivity but I feel that there is a net loss when each group’s natural integrity is lost and replaced by an all inclusive “supergroup” that is poorly thought out and forced because of mere “good intentions” .  The noble intentions of priests has done more harm than good, in many ways is the reason why we are in this mess the first place.\n\nIf I am not mistaken the Hacker ethic already proclaimed inclusivity as a corner stone. This chaotic but functional diversity is something we see in our programming tribes naturally and I wish more research was done in this area."
