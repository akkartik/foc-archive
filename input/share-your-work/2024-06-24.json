        "text": "Bret got unlucky, I got lucky.\n\nGeometric Algebra has gone through several forms. The person Bret read was David Hestenes, a slightly eccentric but very smart guy (ex student of John Wheeler alongside Hugh Everett, Kip Thorne, and Richard Feynman). Hestenes is motivated by physics, and to him there were two particlar algebras that were most interesting: Cl(3) which does rotations and reflections around the origin (and TLDR is isomorphic to the Pauli matrices of electron spin), Cl(1,3) which does special relativity and the Dirac equation, and Cl(4,1) which does conformal transformations of 3D space (and to a lesser extent Cl(4))\n\n**For a physicist**, Hestenes was a pretty Tools For Thought guy. The thing he wanted to emphasize was that Dirac had a strong visual intuition, and he wanted to bring that back into physics. The pauli algebra is usually thought of by physicists as 2x2 complex matrices, but this really does hide what's going on a lot - the basis matrices look completely different from one another, even though they are, geometrically, orthogonal reflection planes through the origin - very visualizable.\n\nAlright, that's physics - what does he have to offer to, say, computer animation? Well, he presented Cl(4) and Cl(4,1) as being useful. But 4,1, called \"Conformal Geometric Algebra\", is 5 dimensional and has a proliferation of pretty weird transformations and objects - even for 3D it is overkill, and Bret was interested in 2D. The other, Cl(4), works a bit better, but causes things to curve in strange ways!\n\nOn top of that, Hestenes talks a big game about visualizability and understandability - but he is not actually all that good at explaining things, and he has aesthetic preferences that make him uninterested in a lot of what computer animation needs",

The person Bret read was David Hestenes, a slightly eccentric but very smart guy (ex student of John Wheeler alongside Hugh Everett, Kip Thorne, and Richard Feynman). Hestenes is motivated by physics, and to him there were two particlar algebras that were most interesting: Cl(3) which does rotations and reflections around the origin (and TLDR is isomorphic to the Pauli matrices of electron spin), Cl(1,3) which does special relativity and the Dirac equation, and Cl(4,1) which does conformal transformations of 3D space (and to a lesser extent Cl(4))\n\n**For a physicist**, Hestenes was a pretty Tools For Thought guy. The thing he wanted to emphasize was that Dirac had a strong visual intuition, and he wanted to bring that back into physics. The pauli algebra is usually thought of by physicists as 2x2 complex matrices, but this really does hide what's going on a lot - the basis matrices look completely different from one another, even though they are, geometrically, orthogonal reflection planes through the origin - very visualizable.\n\nAlright, that's physics - what does he have to offer to, say, computer animation? Well, he presented Cl(4) and Cl(4,1) as being useful. But 4,1, called \"Conformal Geometric Algebra\", is 5 dimensional and has a proliferation of pretty weird transformations and objects - even for 3D it is overkill, and Bret was interested in 2D. The other, Cl(4), works a bit better, but causes things to curve in strange ways!\n\nOn top of that, Hestenes talks a big game about visualizability and understandability - but he is not actually all that good at explaining things, and he has aesthetic preferences that make him uninterested in a lot of what computer animation needs"
