Can complex advanced math be made super simple? Could calculus, linear algebra , quaternions, eigan vectors, cross products, determinants, solving equations, etc be taught in hours instead of years?

Sorry I meant to turn this into a thread.<br/><br/>But, listening to the latest podcast (<a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/037">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/037</a>) with Jonathan Edwards really got me wondering...<br/><br/>There's this assumption by many in this forum that programming can be made easy. So my question, can math be made easy is meant to be along the same lines. If math can not be made easy then maybe programming can also not be made easy. Note: I'm not saying programming is math. Rather I'm wondering if just like the fact that math seems to be a difficult topic as there is soooo much stuff to learn and much of it is hard to explain, maybe programming is also just at a basic level a hard topic as there is tons to learn and much of it is hard to explain.<br/><br/>In the podcast Excel is brought up and it's possible that excel style formulas are an easier kind of form of programming but I'd be really curious the percentage of people there are that actually write formulas in excel as well as the percentage of people than the write them from scratch vs copy and paste from some reference.<br/><br/>I'm not saying programming can't be made better than it is today but I wonder if it can get orders of magnitude simpler or if it's just an inherently complex process.
