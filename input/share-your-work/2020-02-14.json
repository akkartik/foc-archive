The cheaper way to do it, which is how i did it with my previous products Flying Colors and Discus, was to pass out the home phone number of the developer to the users as the tech support line, and see what comes up.

With enough elapsed time and strong feedback, you can polish your product to a very high degree. I believe all development teams should be forced to man the support lines at least one day out of 5 so that they learn first hand how dumb their users are in terms of computers, and how easily gone astray they go. The best software design is done iteratively, and when you are designing for people you need feedback from the actual users.
