<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Drewverlee</span> 1. Plain mathy sets.  Like a set with three things in it {A, B, C} .  For the sake of discussion, we will be fine sticking to finite sets.  (The interesting qualities of infinite sets aren't going to be relevant.)<br/><br/>2. Sets are unordered.  Interchange <b>does not</b> exactly mean changing order — but there is a connection.  Remember what a function from {A, B, C} to {A, B, C} does.  It tells you what A goes to, what B goes to, and what C goes to.  One function is {A ↦ B, B ↦ C, C ↦ A}.  Another is {A ↦ B, B ↦ A, C ↦ A}.  For short, we can <b>use</b> order to name these functions.  Let [BCA] = {A ↦ B, B ↦ C, C ↦ A} and let [BAA] = {A ↦ B, B ↦ A, C ↦ A}.  In this [xyz] notation, x is what A goes to, y is what B goes to, and z is what C goes to.  What's the identity function? [ABC].  Play with some compositions [BCA][BAA] = [AAB].  (Here I mean [BCA] followed by [BAA].)  Do another [BCA][BCA] = [CAB].  [CAB][BCA] = [ABC].<br/><br/>Something extra subtle is going on here.  Given an set {A, B, C} – unordered, you can use an ordered list [xyz] :: {A, B, C} → {A, B, C} to represent <b>function</b> on {A, B, C}.  An "interchange" (or permutation) is a function which has all three elements as values.  So [BCA] is a permutation and [BAA] is not.  A bunch of permutations of the set closed under composition is called a "group."  There are a few groups over the set with three elements, but the group of all the permutations is the fun one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group_of_order_6.">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group_of_order_6.</a>

Thanks for the explanation!
