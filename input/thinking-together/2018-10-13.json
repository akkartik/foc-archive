It may be because Gregg and I think of money as \"the current implementation of money\" where you're seeing it as something more general. If I'm right, can you elaborate on where the boundary is between \"money\" and other sorts of incentives?\n\nThis feels like an important subject. I think it's impossible to discuss \"the future of programming\" without facing up to the dysfunctional incentives that have led to the current state of programming.",

Motivation has been considered as one of the most important reasons that inspires a person to move forward.

I’m trying to wrap my head around tasks where extrinsic incentives work well according to your definition — do you have an example for what you had in mind?\n\nAnd if I understand you correctly, you mean that writing software does not fall into that category?\nDoes that mean you are arguing software shouldn’t be sold (for money)?\n\nAnd I have to admit that you lost me at the end with passion and motivation… to me it sounds like the best word for what you describe is _trust_. But I’m not sure where that connects to the original thought about money.\n\nGoing back to <@UC6997THT>’s YouTube example: I think “YouTube would be 1000x better without money” triggered my response, because I think it’s very easy to make the mistake of only seeing the negative side of money, the corruption, the misguided incentives (based on making money over delivering value), and all the business-types who show up that we’d rather like to stay home. But that’s unfortunately how markets work. If there is value, people will come and try to exploit that. But it also paves the way and breaks down barriers of entry for everyone, making it possible for real value creators and those who just want to express themselves to contribute. The money amplifies or accelerates both the good and the bad parts. One comes with the other. Even if we’d only like to have the good parts.",

But that’s unfortunately how markets work. If there is value, people will come and try to exploit that. But it also paves the way and breaks down barriers of entry for everyone, making it possible for real value creators and those who just want to express themselves to contribute. The money amplifies or accelerates both the good and the bad parts. One comes with the other. Even if we’d only like to have the good parts."

But knowledge work increases the degrees of freedom of each worker manyfold.\n\n&gt; And if I understand you correctly, you mean that writing software does not fall into that category?\n\nYeah. The rise of open source software is a pretty strong hint here. There's something that changes when programmers can choose what they work on. Part of it is that their concerns become more long term. When it's just a job one is more inclined to take shortcuts, particularly if they won't be noticed for a few weeks or months (by which time you may have switched teams, or gotten promoted). But if it's your baby you think about it in the shower, you argue and agonize endlessly about tiny decisions. And the thousands of tiny decisions done right move the needle on externally visible quality.\n\nModern \"20% time\" and periodic in-company hackathons try to combine industrial organization with intrinsic motivation. You get paid, but you also get a looser leash to decide what to do. (But not _too_ loose, because we don't yet know how to make it work.)\n\n&gt; Going back to <@UC6997THT>’s YouTube example: I think “YouTube would be 1000x better without money” triggered my response\n\nAt least the way I interpreted it, it was a statement of fact rather than values. When Youtube first started, the time of the original generation of Numa-numa memes (<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KmtzQCSh6xk>) it was uneven but often authentic and serendipitous. When they first started paying creators things got better for a time (so no, money is not all negative), but the competition for money drew in more people who wouldn't otherwise make videos. And it brought in the A\/B testers. And all that over ten years has made it a thousand times worse than before the money. Money had benefits, and yes both benefits and drawbacks magnified, but _in this arena_ the drawbacks have swamped benefits.\n\nOr at least that's how I see it.",
