If you join that channel, every so often (avg. once a month) you'll be paired up with one other random member (via a bot named Donut). The two of you will then be able to schedule a video call, or just chat a bit in the DMs. It's a fun way to get to know other folks here in the Slack. The next round of pairs will be sent out on Monday, August 24th, so join <#C018Q3T30LW|random-encounters> now if you'd like take part in that.\n\nSecond announcement will be [spoilers] the Member Handbook, but it's not quite done yet. Stay tuned, see you soon!",
