Hi all,<br/>- I came across the future of coding podcast a few weeks ago, and got through just about all of the back catalogue by listening whenever I was driving<br/><br/>- I'm from the UK, currently near Bristol.<br/><br/>- My undergrad was in Ergonomics/Human Factors Design<br/>	- My dissertation was on improving the graphical communication of a commonly used (in the field) cognitive tool/methodology (hierarchical task analysis)<br/><br/>- I've done a lot more programming in C than Javascript/functional languages, so I may be coming from a slightly different place than many here, but hey, it takes all sorts right?! :wink:<br/>	- I'm also a 'fan' of the Handmade Hero/Handmade Network approach to programming. I'm hoping that these aren't incompatible!<br/>	- I do want the programmer/software design experience to be better, but I want to make sure this is not at the expense of the end user of the software.<br/>		- The key components of the argument are roughly<br/>			- We can't expect improved hardware to account for reduced software performance:<br/>				1) Individual processors seem to have reached a heat barrier in terms of clock speed<br/>				2) Most problems are not trivially parallelizable across multiple processors.<br/>			- Generalized abstractions tend to have a significant performance cost attached<br/>		- As such, there is (at least for the moment) a class of problems where the cost of writing in beautiful abstractions is too high in terms of end program performance.<br/>		- For this area, I think that the biggest wins are likely to be in improving the UI/UX/representation and reducing the feedback loop<br/>	- I've previously made rudimentary C tools aimed at reducing the feedback loop - live recompiling, live variable editing.<br/><br/>- I'm currently working on something similar to Glen Chiacchieri's REPLugger using LLVM/Clang. This is starting with C(++), but should hopefully not be too difficult to add frontends for other compiled languages due to the way LLVM works.

&gt; I came across the future of coding podcast a few weeks ago, and got through just about all of the back catalogue by listening whenever I was driving<br/><br/>Love this! This is why I created it as a podcast: so fast to consume. A whole 1.5 years of work, 34 episodes, ~50 hours, in just a couple weeks. Thanks for listening :heart:

yeah it's definitely the medium I can find time for the easiest. Thank you for making the podcast and starting this!

Hello from another C programmer and anti-abstractionista :slightly_smiling_face: But what is "the argument"?

I guess that 'the argument' was somewhat implicit... It was intended as a corrective against the idea that "everything in programming can be fixed by more (and better) abstraction", which is the extreme version of an idea I see quite often. There is certainly some validity to it, but I hope people its limitations.<br/>(see <a href="https://everythingstudies.com/2017/12/19/the-signal-and-the-corrective/">https://everythingstudies.com/2017/12/19/the-signal-and-the-corrective/</a> on base assumptions)

I just read your link and skimmed the comment and post you linked to. My links are more narrow and focused on just software, so I'm not sure how useful they are to you.<br/><br/>Signal vs corrective seems like another way to think about James Scott's notion of Legibility from <em>"Seeing like a State"</em>.<br/><br/>Your link reminded me of a less software-focused post I wrote years ago: <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/04/09/the-legibility-tradeoff">https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/04/09/the-legibility-tradeoff</a>
