I.e. A node can be a child of another node - in addition to having other kind of edges.\nCytoscape JS is great at visualizing such graphs, but I couldn’t find a visual editor for these kind of datasets. This is NOT a diagram-editor for which there are plenty of choices (like TLDraw or Excalidraw).\n\nThis is built with SVG and Svelte and works completely in the browser.
