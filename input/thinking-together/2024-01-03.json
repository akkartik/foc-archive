There was one that recently went mildly viral because it produced structures that (very superficially IMO) resemble cells. That's a feeling.\n\n(Re \"toys\": I very distantly resemble an article about game design that described games as being a combination of a \"toy\", i.e. some mechanics to interact with where you can cause effects, and a goal state(s) to create with that toy.
