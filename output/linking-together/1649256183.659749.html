Hello again Future of Coding! Its been awhile, at least for me.  I recently found this piece describe the example of dOrg and how they work as a DAO but also relate to the state (taxes and stuff) as an entity.:<br/><a href="https://time.com/6146406/working-at-dao-dorg/">https://time.com/6146406/working-at-dao-dorg/</a><br/><br/>here is their site:<br/><a href="https://www.dorg.tech/#/">https://www.dorg.tech/#/</a><br/><br/>And here are my short notes on the article:<br/><br/><b>No Bosses: What It’s Like Working at a DAO</b><br/>#tags: #discord #daos #blockchain #article<br/>via zodiac discord<br/><a href="https://time.com/6146406/working-at-dao-dorg/">https://time.com/6146406/working-at-dao-dorg/</a><br/>some short experience report dOrg from the US<br/>paragraph head lines:<br/>There is no management team, and everyone owns the company<br/>Developers choose their own projects and control their own budgets<br/>The company outsources health benefits<br/>Conflicts are mediated and then voted on.<br/>Salaries are transparent<br/>Skill-building is still a work-in-progress.<br/>==========&gt;<br/>My question for you: What do you think about this? Would you work for a DAO? Why would you not? Why would you? Thank you :slightly_smiling_face:

Good article. Lots in common with worker-owned collectives; the blockchain stuff is just an implementation detail that seems to make running the collective easier? That's a more compelling pitch than I've seen before.<br/><br/>This seems relevant: <a href="https://yakcollective.mirror.xyz/aJdO_SO3gw34cLtwBwNC2OD3s0YT3us9C-C2NNPQ_us">https://yakcollective.mirror.xyz/aJdO_SO3gw34cLtwBwNC2OD3s0YT3us9C-C2NNPQ_us</a>

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jack Rusher</span> although people processes are the foundation. They have nice DAO/voting tools etc.. I’m curious if this becomes available in my country (Germany) too. Which is why I have a talk with someone about that today.

I'm also very interested in worker co-ops, including watching how legal affordances for them are growing in Germany. Here's a nice article on the topic (link to German version at the bottom):<br/><a href="https://www.mitbestimmung.de/html/renewing-worker-cooperatives-for-the-10960.html">https://www.mitbestimmung.de/html/renewing-worker-cooperativ&hellip;</a><br/>... but I still don't see the benefits of choosing a blockchain as the technology to implement the technical side of such an organization :man-shrugging::skin-tone-2:

Another thing that somehow hangs on my mind..<br/>I also had this very interesting discussion with a friend of mine. He is part of a bigger project and he told me about how he <em>NOT</em> wanted to use Lisp( clojure) for that project new 2022 effort ( building something). Because of the things that happend with a project using clojure in 2017. I told him about the Lisp Curse <a href="http://www.winestockwebdesign.com/Essays/Lisp_Curse.html">http://www.winestockwebdesign.com/Essays/Lisp_Curse.html</a> And it went to some interesting places I think.  Would you be interested in discussing these for about 30 minutes next week <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jack Rusher</span>?

The main societal interest I see in DAOs is that they attract lots of fresh new minds to the question of governance at various scales of human organizations. My bet is that whatever they come up with can then probably be better implemented without a blockchain.

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span>! I think the crypto/web3 people agree with you:<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/notscottmoore/status/1475901623994130445?s=20&amp;t=ZyWOR5odUt7oGQwedEeDrA">https://twitter.com/notscottmoore/status/1475901623994130445&hellip;</a> "I conclude that what may have the most impact on the future isn't decentralized digital technology alone but the governance patterns it culturally normalizes."<br/>Its a interesting playing field, but they are still - of course - wrestling with all the problems that came before: How to create technology that has a "non negative influence" on attention? How to organize  patterns of Resonance? Technology Narratives like Blockchain/crypto/web3 or AI always are strong projection spaces. As you can imagine there are people in the world who have preconceptions about "money" and they now are pushing hard their values and believes in the blockchain/crypto/web3 narrative. So from that perspective I always try to encourage people to find their spot in it, maybe to finally realize better visions of "money" and all which that entails.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andreas S.</span> There's perhaps a fundamental problem of human nature at work: The people who tend to invest a lot of energy into social change tend to hold strong and simplistic beliefs as well, and I guess that's what it takes for motivation. On the other end of the spectrum, you find people who are aware of the complexity of the world and are paralyzed by it.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span> it’s definitely a challenge in humility, to see things you can do and do them but also see the things you can’t not do and accept those. I recently read this interesting perspective. Which provides an interesting model consisting of a triangle: inner change, cultural change and system change. Balancing those is a tough challenge. I see web3 and technology more generally between culture and systems change. But all of that needs some kind of foundation within the individual. As such I’m happy to see that these sensemaking individuals now slowly form groups. Eventually they will meet the “others” and we will see if these movements provide patterns which help us better that what we have now.<br/><a href="https://ecosystem.lifeitself.us">https://ecosystem.lifeitself.us</a>

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andreas S.</span> That's an interesting map of metamodernist movements. The one I am most familiar with is Metamoderna (aka Hanzi Freinacht), which I'd put higher up on the triangle because it does care a lot about inner change. I agree with you that web3 is stuck on an edge of that triangle, I'd even say close to the corner of systems change.
