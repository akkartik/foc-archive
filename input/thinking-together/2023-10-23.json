        "text": "*Replacing authentication with visual identity*\n\nBackground: I'm starting to think about building a new forum. Given <https:\/\/akkartik.name\/freewheeling\/|my past>, it won't surprise anyone that I mean to do this outside the morass of non-convivial software that is the modern web browser. My broad plan is:\n\n• LÖVE v12 will support https, and <https:\/\/github.com\/love2d\/love\/actions|release candidates> are already quite stable. Good enough to start building on.\n• I'll build my forum out of a server-side API in Lua and a client in LÖVE v12. (Should be easy to support Windows, Linux, BSD and Android. Mac and iOS will require some annual contortions to build LÖVE for oneself.)\n• The server side will of course be open source just like the client. In addition, all post\/comment data will be published to a git repo on something like a daily basis.\nThe one major open question concerns authentication. How can we have stable identity? The above architecture is intended to allow anyone to host the forum (without trying to build galaxy-brain merkle trees, federated protocols or CRDTs), and I would prefer to not take a position of power as the source of everyone's hashed passwords (an intrinsically centralizing architecture).\n\nA few months ago someone showed me this ancient essay called <https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20091126092028\/http:\/\/www.kuro5hin.org\/story\/2009\/3\/12\/33338\/3000|\"attacked from within\">, and I find myself thinking about it often. The whole thing is worth reading, but for this thread the crucial list of bullets halfway down is:\n• Registration keeps out good posters.\n• Registration lets in bad posters.\n• Registration attracts trolls.\n• Anonymity counters vanity.\nA provocative worldview that seems at least worth exploring. Keeping this in mind, I have a hazy idea that looks like this:\n• When you run the client you get to choose your handle, but it's not unique (cf. <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zooko%27s_triangle|Zooko's Triangle>)\n• When you run the client for the first time, it creates an RSA keypair for you.\n• When composing messages, the client signs the message with your private key (<https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Signing_messages|description on Wikipedia>)\n• When rendering messages, the client validates the signature against your public key and shows something like an <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Identicon|identicon> of the public key.\nImplications of this setup:\n• No registration\n• Your \"password\" (private key) never leaves your device(s).\n• When reading a thread you see a handle like `spiralganglion`. However, the handle is not authoritative. Next to it is an identicon that is authoritative.\n• It's easy in a thread to see if there are ever two people with the same handle but different identicons.\n• Since the client platform is starting from scratch, accessibility and internationalization will be a challenge for a long time :confused:\nNo guarantees this is all doable. It's quite possible the cryptographic operations will be untenably slow when implemented in Lua, and a native library for them would complicate the simple install story that is LÖVE's greatest strength.\n\nBut I'm curious to get people's thoughts on this idea in principle.",
