The basic idea is it overlays on top of any webpage or PDF and lets you annotate parts of it with text and tags. You can reply to annotations as well. Here's an example of how it looks: <https:\/\/hyp.is\/uIQ3RiK0Eeq_kBNudD0B8Q\/futureofcoding.org\/>. It uses PDF fingerprints so the location of the PDF doesn't matter (could even be loaded from a local file) - the annotations will show up.\n\nThe advantage is it is kind of lightweight to adopt - doesn't need us to set up a server. Doesn't even need an extension in Firefox, you can just install a bookmarklet. To try it out we could create a FoC group on hypothesis and paste the invite link here. You also get a feed view of everything that's being annotated, e.g. <https:\/\/hypothes.is\/users\/shalabh>.",

Doesn't even need an extension in Firefox, you can just install a bookmarklet. To try it out we could create a FoC group on hypothesis and paste the invite link here. You also get a feed view of everything that's being annotated, e.g. "
