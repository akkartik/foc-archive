<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> it is tough running a community. How much time a month does it take and are there any monetary costs?

So far, "running" the community has mostly meant asking people for pain points and trying to figure out ways to salve them. That takes time, but not much, and I enjoy it. I'd eventually like to start new initiatives that might have a small monetary cost, but there's nothing happening on that front just yet, other than the possible move to a different discussion platform.<br/><br/>The podcast, however, has a meaningful time cost and monetary cost. It took about 40 hours for me to make the episode with Jack Rusher, and I'm on pace to spend about that same amount of time on the upcoming episode. Future episodes might take longer, as I explore ways to raise the production quality. Considering the number of people who listen to the podcast, it's worth spending that effort — 40 hours of my time for thousands of hours of listener time. Money wise, there's a monthly cost for the software we use to record the discussion, hosting costs for the episodes, and a cost for the transcription. <a href="http://Repl.it">Repl.it</a> have been paying for the transcription, and I hope that continues.

I think the issue here is that I see if you want to get financial support for FoC you will need to do it full time, which means making a plan to get revenue as well, and perhaps raising investment. However, if FoC is a platform to help push your own ideas then why not continue to do it for free, and treat it as a labor of love. I guess kind of like a marketing cost for your own stuff that can bring in revenue?

The model I am describing is exactly what a guy called Jason Calacanis did with his podcast, this week in startups. He lost money on the podcast for several years but he made up for it 100x as it marketed him and his other stuff

Anyway, I know it can be a lot of work to do a podcast, so if you do ever consider passing the group on then I would be very happy to take it over

&gt; if you want to get financial support for FoC you will need to do it full time<br/>I don't understand why this would be the case. Can you expand on this point a bit?<br/><br/>&gt; if FoC is a platform to help push your own ideas<br/>That's a goal for me only insofar as this community should be a platform to promote everyone's work. I want the "rising tide lifts all boats" outcome.<br/><br/>&gt; why not continue to do it for free, and treat it as a labor of love<br/>I'll happily do the Slack community management stuff indefinitely, patreon or not, since the effort cost is reasonable and I value this community a lot and want it to continue to grow and thrive.<br/><br/>I think the podcast medium has a good balance between what supporters are willing to pay for (patreons and sponsorships), and what you have to subject your audience to in order to earn that payment (brief plugs and sponsor reads) — far healthier balance than ads on the web, on TV, amazon referral links, tracking cookies, etc. So I think that the podcast will be perfectly sustainable on a small scale, even with my eventual goal of making it feel very professional. I love the podcast medium with a tremendous passion, and it's a great complement to all the other audio/video work I do as a job and hobby, and I most certainly don't want it to become something I try to milk for a 100x ROI. I just want to make good episodes, interviewing interesting people that our community will appreciate and enjoy listening to.<br/><br/>If you have an interest in podcasting yourself.. have you thought about starting up a podcast of your own? If you did something that was relevant, you'd have an audience here in this community that'd surely take an interest and give you early feedback.

Yes, I think the proposition of contributing a Patreon to maintain the podcast makes sense: it's nice and takes a bit of work.

I guess for the point "if you want to get financial support for FoC you will need to do it full time" is that I just see it as an incredible amount of work to make a podcast and a community, so you will need a very clear idea of how it will benefit your own projects as well. I guess I want you to avoid the situation where the work increases all the time, and then you have no time to invent the future of coding yourself. And actually I would love it if you got 100x return, or rather 100,000x return, as I am hoping that at least one of the projects on here becomes a breakone success globally and actually changes how development and automation is done.

I have started podcasts and video channels of my own and there are a few videos of me or other community members interviewing people and so I know it is a huge amount of effort to make these things. Here was the last short one I made, but was with the ex CEO of Red Hat, so nothing to do with FoC unfortunately <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z75GvP-nYtA&amp;t=386s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z75GvP-nYtA&amp;t=386s</a>

Anyway, you make many good points, but for me I wouldn't want to set up a similar community as I think FoC has the best chance of doing something great right now

Actually podcasting videos was how I got the chance to back Light Table many years ago, as they saw that I was a super fan as I made so many videos about Clojure and LightTable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCes8JWIQWd9oDa4vbeCeafw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCes8JWIQWd9oDa4vbeCeafw</a>
