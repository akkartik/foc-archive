I've found some things that *seem like* progress, at least. One is ways to filter and keep track of papers etc. using skimming and highlighting of key phrases in some annotation system (I use <http:\/\/hypothes.is|hypothes.is>). The key phrases are ones that are either insights or things I clearly disagree with - so skimming the highlights kind of tells me when and if I want to read more. The other thing is just writing - I keep a semi-organized notes (some sections and sub-sections) with ideas etc that just pop into my head at any time or when reading any material. Every so often I try to do a review and reorg of the notes and sometime I also do a proper write-up of some topic, pulling from my notes. This helps me feel that something is 'processed' and not have to spin that stuff in my head again. I don't really have research 'days' because I only find scattered time here and there.",

The key phrases are ones that are either insights or things I clearly disagree with - so skimming the highlights kind of tells me when and if I want to read more. The other thing is just writing - I keep a semi-organized notes (some sections and sub-sections) with ideas etc that just pop into my head at any time or when reading any material. Every so often I try to do a review and reorg of the notes and sometime I also do a proper write-up of some topic, pulling from my notes. This helps me feel that something is 'processed' and not have to spin that stuff in my head again. I don't really have research 'days' because I only find scattered time here and there."
