If we look at how we get any reuse whatsover there seem to be two clear areas: One area is in-language composition with functions\/types or whatever shareable artifacts it provides. Another area is cross process\/library: C ABI, pipes, JSON+REST etc where you compose larger compiled bundles. The former is too transparent and the latter too opaque. These are the established composition methods but it there room to explore here? Maybe bundles of logic that provide encapsulation, yet allow late-binding with other bundles in ways that provide rich composition as well as performance?\n\nRegarding fragmentation, the question is do we need fragmentation in composition methods? Consider the world before TCP\/IP with large fragmentation of communication protocols. Or a world where bytes aren't all 8-bits. Or a web with various parallel alternatives for HTTP. In any case, while the whole world doesn't have to conform to the 'one way', it would be nice to have composition that is richer\/deeper than 'API', i.e. more like in-language composition, yet allow a diversity of implementation methods. I don't have much clarity here, but it does seem the the two ways of doing composition are arbitrary.",

If we look at how we get any reuse whatsover there seem to be two clear areas: One area is in-language composition with functions\/types or whatever shareable artifacts it provides. Another area is cross process\/library: C ABI, pipes, JSON+REST etc where you compose larger compiled bundles. The former is too transparent and the latter too opaque. These are the established composition methods but it there room to explore here? Maybe bundles of logic that provide encapsulation, yet allow late-binding with other bundles in ways that provide rich composition as well as performance?\n\nRegarding fragmentation, the question is do we need fragmentation in composition methods? Consider the world before TCP\/IP with large fragmentation of communication protocols. Or a world where bytes aren't all 8-bits. Or a web with various parallel alternatives for HTTP. In any case, while the whole world doesn't have to conform to the 'one way', it would be nice to have composition that is richer\/deeper than 'API', i.e. more like in-language composition, yet allow a diversity of implementation methods. I don't have much clarity here, but it does seem the the two ways of doing composition are arbitrary."
