So for me this boils down to: <br/><br/>If the tools we create are too abstract, e.g. just providing a generic programming language, they are maximally generic, can apply to every use case, but lack any connection points to the domain knowledge a specific user has, therefore the learning curve is too steep and regular users won’t adopt this tool.<br/><br/>If the tool is too specific, e.g. implementing a flight booking process with all bells and whistles, it is maximally specialized, only applies to this exact use case and is hard to repurpose, but is easily understood, and can be used by non-programmers, but they can’t use it for anything else.<br/><br/>If we want to enable non-programmers to create software we need to find a sweet spot in between, allowing them to find a connection point to understand what the tool can be used for in their domain, enabling them to creatively repurpose it for what they want.
