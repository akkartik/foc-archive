<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> We used to have monthly in-person FoC meetups in Kitchener-Waterloo. That's how I learned about the slack. Those meetups stopped a few years ago, and this channel has been dead for a long time now. If you live in California, then Ontario CA is a city in San Bernardino county. All the other "in-*" channels are associated with cities. The in-&lt;city&gt; channels have been historically used to coordinate local meetups or find out about local events. Ontario Canada is a huge region, bigger than Texas. I think you should either delete this channel or rename it back to in-kitchener-waterloo. Maybe rename it before deleting it so that the old postings retain their meaning for people looking at old posts.
