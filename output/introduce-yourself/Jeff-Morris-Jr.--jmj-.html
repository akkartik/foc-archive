Hello all! I've been a longtime fan of this community &amp; haven't officially introduced myself. My name is Jeff Morris Jr. - I am now an investor but have spent most of my career building product, most recently as VP of Product, Revenue at Tinder.<br/><br/>My recent favorite investment is Roam Research. I know Conor is a huge fan of this community too.<br/><br/>I wanted to introduce myself to see if any of you are starting companies right now. I find this community to be the most original technical thinkers anywhere on the internet, so I'd be an idiot if I didn't ask.<br/><br/>I launched a product accelerator today and would love to work with folks from this group if you want to start something. Here are more details on that: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/former-tinder-vp-jeff-morris-jr-opens-up-product-club-an-accelerator-meant-to-stay-small-and-focused/?tpcc=ECTW2020">https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/former-tinder-vp-jeff-morr&hellip;</a><br/><br/>Thank you for letting be be a small (and mostly quiet) part of this community. I love the open mindness and creativity that you all share.
