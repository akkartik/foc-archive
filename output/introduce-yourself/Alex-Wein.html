Greetings from Oakland, CA :wave:. I discovered the podcast about a month ago, binged a bunch of episodes, and started lurking here in slack.  I've really enjoyed the conversations around here.  Not sure I'll have a lot to contribute, but I'll definitely keep listening!<br/><br/>Anyways, I'm a data person who over the years has used a lot of different tools for data wrangling and data visualization (Spreadsheets, Stata, SQL, R, Python, JS, Tableau, among others). My favorite tools are the Tidyverse libraries in R, which have made me more curious about FP and DSLs more generally.
