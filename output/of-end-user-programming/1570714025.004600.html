I want to push back on Duncan's list of end-user groups. These are all white-collar professional groups. I am interested in FoC for personal computing, outside of a job context. Consider FoC for kids, or FoC for artists: "If you imagine a world where we only used writing for legal documents, that’d be a pretty boring world,” Mr. Aaron, the Sonic Pi creator, said. “That’s precisely where we are with code. Most code is used for business purposes. That’s not the end game. In the same way we can read and write poems and lyrics, we need to understand that code can have that expressive quality as well.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/style/live-code-music.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/style/live-code-music.html</a>
