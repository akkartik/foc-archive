My first entry here is “How do Committees Invent” by Melvin Conway. If you are familiar with Conway’s Law, this is the paper that introduced it to the world. If you aren’t, Conway’s law is the following<br/><br/>&gt; Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.<br/><br/>Before reading the paper, I had never considered the way in which Conway’s law impacts not only software, but any system designed at a company. <br/><br/>The paper is short and incredibly convincing. The hierarchical workplace organization is almost always a structural mismatch for how we want our software to be. Further, it is rigid in a way we almost never desire for our software. Given Conway’s Law, if we want better software, should we be coming up with better organizational theories? Honestly, I think so.<br/><br/>He ends by asking how we can avoid this problem and says this <br/><br/>&gt; Ways must be found to reward design managers for keeping their organizations lean and flexible.<br/><br/>It is so sad to me that today people would think this meant agile, when in fact, agile is one of the very things holding us back from addressing this issue head on. &lt;/controversial-opinion&gt;<br/><br/>Highly recommend reading even if you feel you already know Conway’s law.
