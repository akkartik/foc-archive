                "text": "Help OpenAI build some of the largest and fastest AI supercomputing clusters in the world! As a Network Systems Engineer, you’ll work at the intersection of hardware and software, designing systems that deliver the maximum possible performance for running large-scale AI models. We work at the very cutting edge of speed and scale, combining the traditions of High-Performance Computing (HPC) in a modern cloud and containerized environment. For this role, it’s important you understand microarchitecture: how to combine CPUs, GPUs, and network devices into systems that are then deployed at a large scale to peak efficiency. You understand the lowest levels of the software platforms that sit on top of this hardware, including how to best optimize the Linux kernel and user-space code. You are capable of writing code to automate the health checks and healing of these systems, commanding a large number of servers with few people. We recently launched our newest cluster, “Owl” with over 250K",
