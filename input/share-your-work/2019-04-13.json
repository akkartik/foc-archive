Merchant gateways from credit cards are pretty trivial, but interestingly many people store the credit card data which they are not supposed to do at all. Stripe is an example where if you had modular code it would help a lot. In the case of Google Maps however, the magic is all on the server side, and in that situation you will have a lot of API's. But you could reduce the API's by a huge factor if you hypothesize a better connection between the two computers than merely JSON. I find the lowest common denominator approach of JSON strings as the interchange between computers to be very crude. Surely we can do a lot better.",
