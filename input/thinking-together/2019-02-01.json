And the iPad has amazing stuff in the music real. However, one thing i don't like about those tools is they are age discriminatory, because nobody much older than 35 is going to be able to read those tiny icons and controls. I think companies should be fined for making products that hamper older people. We are very sensitive in the USA to wheelchair access, but i daily lament the trend toward low contrast interfaces with faint shades of gray icons that are teeny. We need to make programming more inclusive, and make interfaces size adjustable. The ability to program on a small screen is only limited by our ingenuity, however, during debugging of a larger program, a big monitor is frankly a must.",

And the iPad has amazing stuff in the music real. However, one thing i don't like about those tools is they are age discriminatory, because nobody much older than 35 is going to be able to read those tiny icons and controls. I think companies should be fined for making products that hamper older people. We are very sensitive in the USA to wheelchair access, but i daily lament the trend toward low contrast interfaces with faint shades of gray icons that are teeny. We need to make programming more inclusive, and make interfaces size adjustable. The ability to program on a small screen is only limited by our ingenuity, however, during debugging of a larger program, a big monitor is frankly a must."

It also is evidently a transpiler to JS as well as a compiled language. That must have been a lot of work to reconcile those two universes (presuming they use LLVM or something to emit machine code). This was obviously a huge project, representing millions in R&D dollars. From first glance they embraced OOP as a paradigm, and that might have been one of their downfalls."
