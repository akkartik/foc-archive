Hi all, invited by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span> after I contacted him about his Onex project I found a few months ago. From my interest in astronomy, found <a href="http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/futurelang.php">http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/futurelang.php</a> and Lojban, then Clean. As a basic/assembler/c++ coder, I discovered functional programming. Then I looked for LISP, quickly found Erlang, then Racket. My latest discoveries are Picat and Elm (and perhaps Pyret). Always had a problem with programming language verbosity, how much "useless" lines have to be input before getting actual things done. Java someone ? Anyway, thinking about my own programming language for years now, something more about declarative programming (Picat) but that can be also edited visually. Hence my interest in Onex and TreeSheets (from <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Wouter van Oortmerssen</span> ). I really like the spreadsheet representation that can already be found in property sheets, close to data base editing. Wanna add data ? Add columns/rows. Wanna change the code ? Add more formulas. And the underlying code is still textual and can be edited using a terminal and/or refactored/analyzed using standard tools. I'd like to avoid the culprit programming languages such like Labview of Windev that needs a proprietary, complex and heavyweight IDE to edit/compile the code. My main aim is ai, db and embedded coding. I like easy prototyping languages like Python, interpreted and/or fast to compile, easy to debug. Also greatly interested/influenced by Bret Victor's work on real-time feedback user interfaces. So, here I am, and thanks for the invitation.
