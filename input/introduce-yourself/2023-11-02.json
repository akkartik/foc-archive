Been doing design and front-end since ~2004 and it's been while since I was this excited about new tech, especially defining the new use cases, UX\/UI paradigms and best practises around gen AI.\n\nAside from work I run a Cyberpunk RED TTRPG campaign and been exploring an AI assistant there to help our group with rules &amp; lore with a locally running setup (I'll post a demo when I'm happy with how it works).\n\nFound this group via awesome demos from meet-ups that float in social media and looking forward to attending an event in the near future.",
