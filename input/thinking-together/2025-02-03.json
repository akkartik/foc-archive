I wish there were a drawing or storyboard to visualize that.\n\nI’m not sure if you’re still referring to a 2D screen medium, but I can imagine this working perfectly well on a 2D surface in 3D like a table, where you push\/pull using gestures.\n\nI think connectivity is pretty important for what I wanted to explore in terms of rules and cause\/effect sorts of things. (When the light is white, it’s safe to cross the street.)\nI realize this kind of conflicts with what you felt is cool, or maybe it’s unrelated."
