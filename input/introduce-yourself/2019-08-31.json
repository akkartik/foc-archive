I'm not worried about overstaying the conclusions. I still am always on the hunt for flaws, but after over 2 years and feedback from over 1k people without anyone providing a single proof by contradiction, and over 1k weekly users now, I'm slightly more confident in the grandiose claims? I dunno. Regardless, I'm more of an empiricist than a theorist, and think the best arguments in favor of Tree Notation will be killer apps. Which require killer tools. Which requires lots more work. :cry:",

I'm not worried about overstaying the conclusions. I still am always on the hunt for flaws, but after over 2 years and feedback from over 1k people without anyone providing a single proof by contradiction, and over 1k weekly users now, I'm slightly more confident in the grandiose claims? I dunno. Regardless, I'm more of an empiricist than a theorist, and think the best arguments in favor of Tree Notation will be killer apps. Which require killer tools. Which requires lots more work.
