<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> I consider money a tool. Like a knife. You can take a knife and cut bread with it and give it to a homeless person. Or you can stab the homeless person. Same tool. Very different outcomes. <br/>The problem isn’t the tool (knives/money), but how you use it. If you say “tool is bad” you’re using a rhetoric trick of charging something neutral with meaning (negative or positive — works in both directions) that is done all the time, whether you are aware of it/doing it intentionally or not.<br/><br/>I don’t understand what you mean by “current implementation of money” and why I’m using a “more general” meaning. I’m talking about money as the universally accepted medium to exchange and store value, including all its good and bad uses. If you consider the “current implementation” something that is inherently bad for some reason, I’d love for you to elaborate why that is.<br/><br/>That said and putting this probably not too relevant linguistic hair-splitting aside, I absolutely agree that thinking about incentives, and consequences, and values is something our industry specifically needs to learn and get a lot better at.
