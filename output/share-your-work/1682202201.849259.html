I think Scratch works a little like your proposal, right? Instead of function calls, messages are broadcast, and every object can respond.<br/><br/><a href="https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Broadcast_()<em>(block)">https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Broadcast</em>()_(block)</a>

Are Scratch Broadcast blocks the same as 0D?<br/><br/><a href="https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Broadcast_()<em>(block)">https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Broadcast</em>()_(block)</a><br/><br/>Yes and No.<br/><br/>Technically, they are similar.<br/><br/>Psychologically, the are not in the same ballpark.<br/><br/>I argue that 0D (aka decoupling / aka necessary-condition-for-concurrency) needs to be driven deep into the notation and not added on as bag on the side.<br/><br/>There is a subtle difference between AX and DX (and UX) (Academic eXercise, Developer eXperience, User eXperience, resp.).  Just having a capability doesn’t necessarily mean that it will foment fresh ideas on solving problems.<br/><br/>For example, if only AX mattered, then everyone would be using Assembler instead of higher-level languages.  Or, everyone would use Lisp instead of ???.<br/><br/>If all you’ve got is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail.  If all you’ve got is Functions, then everything looks like an instantaneous function (timing looks to be irrelevant). [aside: one of the issues with making everything a Function is the “particle/wave duality” of IF-THEN-ELSE.  In a Function, IF represents the conditional value of data.  In code, though, IF gets used way beyond its Functional meaning, leading to ad-hoc gotchas and pronouncements about State being bad,]<br/><br/>This statement in the above Scratch page...<br/><br/>&gt; Recursion is a process where a script calls into itself. Broadcast scripts can perform a limited kind of recursion, called tail recursion, by broadcasting their own message at the end of the script, restarting the script and forming a loop.<br/>...means that Scratch got it wrong.  Recursion and message-sending are not the same thing.  Recursion is LIFO, whereas message-sending is FIFO. The above statement says that Scratch has tried to force a LIFO behaviour onto FIFO message-sending (that looks like the hammer-and-nail thing, again :-).
