Technically, Eve totally doesn't work this way.  Instead of binding to the future, commits are primitive.  To establish a regular binding, say an Idyll <tt>[derived name: "x2" value:</tt>x * x<tt>]</tt>, you basically use two commit rules internally.  You commit <tt>x2</tt> to the value of <tt>x * x</tt>.  This makes it so that as <tt>x</tt> changes with time, <tt>x2</tt> will assume the different squared values.  You also add the commit rule that if <tt>x</tt> doesn't have a value, remove the value of <tt>x2</tt>.  That's the edge case.<br/><br/>Beyond that, Eve commit and bind rules work differently when multiple rules influence a value.  With commits, it's a race.  Whoever updated last wins.  With bindings, we allow for ties.  Suppose that we also cheekily bind <tt>x2</tt> to <tt>x * 2</tt>.  Then <tt>x2</tt> will usually (except at 0 and 2) have two values.  (Variables in Eve are intrinsically multivalued.)  In order to implement the <tt>x2 = x * 2</tt> binding with commits, the positive commit rule needs the side condition that if <tt>x2 != x * 2</tt> the rule should fire again.<br/><br/>I was never particularly satisfied with how Eve resolves these races.  (The answer changed from version to version.)  I doubt there is an universally satisfying answer in principle.  (Kind of like the inheritance diamond problem.)  We are never going to get away from confusing edge cases, better to design ambiguity resolution into our programming systems.
