I contribute to open source projects and work on my own framework called Rete.js. <http:\/\/rete.js.org>\n\nI started learning programming more than 5 years ago, studied languages ​​ PHP -&gt; JS -&gt; C++ -&gt; C# -&gt; Java -&gt; ES6\/TS. Now basically I programming on JavaScript.\n\nAt the moment I see the benefit for myself in languages ​​such as JS\/TS and C++, but one of the problems still remains - writing the code. Perhaps someone will argue that you need to have a good knowledge  of programming language. I agree, good knowledge will allow you to write quality code, but there are problems with reading someone else's code that is written in a different style (or has poor quality).\n\nBeing inspired by UE4, Substance Designer and Plant factory I decided to write my own library for creating such editors in the browser (dataflow programming). At that time (as now) I didn’t find a universal and customizable framework\/library. I have started writing a library called D3-Node-Editor (March, 2017) and after a year of development I revised many approaches and rewrote it to the new architecture and called Rete.js. <https:\/\/github.com\/retejs\/rete>\n\nAre there somebody who have experience in Dataflow programming and know the current unsolved problems? I'm going to postgraduate studies to working with dataflow and my framework, but my scientific director (I hope I correctly translated to english phrase \"научный руководитель\") says that a dissertation must contains scientific novelty, and framework is only a tool. So I am not sure whether to continue studying at the university in order to do this, since among professors no one has much experience with visual programming.",

It was inspired by the workshop Applied Category Theory 2018, which she attended, and I think it makes a great complement to Fong and Spivak&rsquo;s book Seven Sketches and my online course based on that book:\n&bull; Tai-Danae Bradley, What is Applied Category Theory?\n\n  Abstract. This is a collection of introductory, expository notes on applied category theory, inspired by the 2018 Applied Category Theory Workshop, and in these notes we take a leisurely stroll through two themes (functorial semantics and compositionality), two constructions (monoidal categories and decorated cospans) and two examples (chemical reaction networks and natural language processing) within the field.\n\nCheck it out!",
