We already have technology that explicitly reflects other anti-X values, like FOSS reflecting anti-capitalist values, so this feels quite possible.\n\n(NB. with respect to \"design inspired by the present moment\", it's worth being mindful of the lesson here: <https:\/\/medium.com\/design-toast\/black-lives-matter-is-not-a-design-challenge-f6e452ff7821> — there may be Black members of our community who would value weighing-in on this thread, but who are unable to do so.)",

You'll need that for a projectional editor too I guess). To do that, I firstly consider comments as whitespace. In my syntax grammar, all bottom-level constructs (literals) contain no whitespace, but there is a piece of \"required whitespace\" between arguments in an S-expression and a piece of \"optional whitespace\" after the opening and before the closing parenthesis. So an S-Expression contains N child-expressions and N+1 (potentially empty) whitespace segments. I do not parse the comments especially or associate them to other elements, but your whitespace could also be a structure that explicitly stores comments as separate entities.\n\n*EDIT:* in case it's not clear, the structure I use is an AST.",

You'll need that for a projectional editor too I guess). To do that, I firstly consider comments as whitespace. In my syntax grammar, all bottom-level constructs (literals) contain no whitespace, but there is a piece of \"required whitespace\" between arguments in an S-expression and a piece of \"optional whitespace\" after the opening and before the closing parenthesis. So an S-Expression contains N child-expressions and N+1 (potentially empty) whitespace segments. I do not parse the comments especially or associate them to other elements, but your whitespace could also be a structure that explicitly stores comments as separate entities.\n\n"

The problem in the USA, the problem of interest right now due to the cultural moment, isn't just about, say, the relative percentage of various races employed in tech.

It's a far broader and deeper issue. I hope that enough of us are aware of the scope of that issue and are able to think about how to address it. That's the conversation Will set up, and that's the conversation we should be having in this thread. If you'd like to discuss other facets of the intersection of race and tech, I'll meet you in a new thread.)"
