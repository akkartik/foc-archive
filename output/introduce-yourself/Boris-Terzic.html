Hi all! My name is Boris Terzic, I'm a programmer originally from Belgium, now working and living in Germany. I discovered Future of Coding through the podcast (my new favorite) and after listening to a bunch of episodes got increasingly curious about what's going on here.<br/><br/>By day I am the head of development of a smaller Germany software company building a web based GIS and BI application.<br/><br/>In my free time I am very interested in offline-first datastructures and models like CRDTs and in general building web-native sites and applications. Deep down I think I may also want to be a graphics programmer, but I have almost no experience with it aside from some demo scene noodling when I was younger.<br/><br/>Happy to be here and looking forward to read and share interesting thoughts!
