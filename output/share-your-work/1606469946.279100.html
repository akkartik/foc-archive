I am talking on Machine Learning applied to Source Code today at 6pm CET at a very popular DS talk show with Abhishek Thakur.<br/><br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d-w3cx2TlU&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d-w3cx2TlU&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>

It occurred to me today that, by combining tree-sitter &amp; Loyc, it should be straightforward to convert source code of various languages to a common tree format. For example, the Python code<br/><br/>    # Leading comment<br/>    if c &gt; 0:<br/>        x = f<br/>    else:<br/>        y = f(123);<br/><br/>could be converted to an identical syntax tree as the one produced by the C/C#/Java code<br/><br/>    // Leading comment<br/>    if (c &gt; 0) {<br/>      x = f;<br/>    } else {<br/>      y = f(123);<br/>    }<br/><br/>Specifically, I could write a converter that would take any output from tree-sitter and convert it to a Loyc tree. I could then use LeMP macros to straightforwardly convert the syntax tree of a particular language into a mostly-common format. And comments could be preserved too, as I have written a language-agnostic algorithm for this purpose.<br/><br/>Now, from the readme and article about tree-hugger it doesn't <em>look</em> like tree-hugger does something like this, but correct me if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>This wasn't the problem I was interested in solving - I wanted to figure out how to go in the reverse direction, from Loyc tree to text, because part of my dream is to help people convert code between languages. But seeing this video makes me want to ask if conversion to a common format is something that would help the Docly project. If so, I available to help at below-market rates.<br/><br/>You could certainly have a separate ML model for each language - there may be enough code on GitHib to support this approach, at least for popular languages, but perhaps not for new or obscure languages. But if you convert all languages to a common format, a single model might be able to share intuitions across languages, potentially allowing improved summarization in a single model.

Hi, Sorry to reply late. I understand what you are saying and it is very exciting to see that you want to work with us on this problem. It can be very interesting. However, we kind of ran out of money and no fund rising has happened yet. We are still trying and if we can manage it, I will surely get back to you. Sorry for the late reply.
