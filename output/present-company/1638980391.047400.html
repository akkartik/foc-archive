Hello All,<br/><br/>I am here to make a (re)introduction. And the reason is that I am looking for a new adventure. For the last one year I have been working in Robocorp as a Senior Software Engineer. I was leading the AI / ML part. I have built the entire training, ops and related parts their. Here are two interesting projects I had worked on there<br/><br/>1.&gt; Identifying and classifying UI elements from a screen shot- I started with a single line of brief. I created the detail problem statement, defined the methodologies, oversaw the data gathering process, trained, tested and debugged classical and deep learning based algorithms, I managed to out-perform the most advanced algorithm publicly available in this domain, and finally I integrated this in the main product as a PoC. Also, I crafted a detailed documentation of the entire process. And I did all this in less than 6 months of time.<br/><br/>2.&gt; Creating a general purpose DSL to DSL translator- I have worked on this project starting from this July. I started with a minimal brief, I studied the two DSLs, formulated the problem, explored the domains by writing code, and then started to architect the system. I chose Go for the sake of speed and portability. I created the first PoC of this project in less then three months time. The demonstration to selected clients were immensely successful and it spawned a whole new team and became one of the main project in the company. Here also, I created, updated, and maintained a detailed documentation.<br/><br/>What can I do?<br/><br/>I am a Full Stack Engineer in its true sense. I can really work on the whole spectrum.<br/><br/>You have a ReactJS stack? I can work on that (HTML5, CSS3? yes of course if needed I can get my hands dirty and chip in)<br/>You have a back-end in Python (Flask, FastAPI, Django...) or Go? (postgres? MySql? MongoDB? Cassandra... ?) I can write APIs, Scale it, maintain it, guide junior engineers to work... You name it.<br/>You need to create a complex and demanding Data Engineering pipeline? Involving (but not limited to), Kafka, Beam, Spark, Redis, Snowflake, Graph Data Base...? I am the person who can do it<br/>You need Machine Learning engineer? Formulate the problem, explore different avenues, Create PoC and test it against real world data (mainly CV and NLP), Work on the promising direction to bring it to production (Very few ML projects see the daylight because often the skills to bring them to production is lacking)? I will be your go-to person in the company for that<br/>I am also good with Dev-Ops. I know my ways around Ansible, Docker, K8S.<br/>I have always worked in Startups and I am no stranger to high pressure situation and the need for speed of delivery (yet keeping the quality)<br/><br/><br/>So as you can see, I am truly fullstack in every sense you think about. I am a passionate engineer with a very easy going personality. I thrive with hard challenges. I am an excellent team player. I am also very familiar with Agile and Scrum based ways of working.<br/><br/>I am attaching my Resume with this message. I am looking forward to hearing from you and jump in an amazing adventure together.
