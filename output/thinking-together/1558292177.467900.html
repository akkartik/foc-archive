One thing I wonder: if you took the union of everyone’s vision for future of coding (in this community), what percentage of the current application space in programming would it cover?<br/><br/>For me, my view of coding is heavily influenced by the applications I’ve personally worked on, which like many of you, is web UI + enterprise CRUD apps + compilers + games + functional programming. Subsequently a lot of the focus is on better databases, better UIs, better compiler toolchains, or more generally better “abstractions”, whatever that means. However I haven’t seen a strong presence in this community from e.g. hardware, cloud computing and data processing, data science, hard sciences (bio, physics, chem, …), supercomputing, simulation, security and privacy, blockchain/crypto, machine learning and AI, robotics, and so on.<br/><br/>I partly mention those apps because in academia (at least Stanford), those are the problem spaces that academics are placing their bets on as the future of ~coding~ computer science. Of course, there’s a completely separate question of how much of the future is engineering vs. research, how much academia values engineering, etc. but I at least wanted to raise the initial question.

I come pretty definitely from the data science “world” / way of thinking. A lot of what computing is about is data transformation, operations, representation etc I feel. Whether it’s building applications, understanding systems, visualization, etc .. data is central.<br/><br/>“Data science” also overlaps with / is a superset of supercomputing, simulation, and ML / AI.

Oh yeah, to be clear, I’m sure that there are several individuals who have direct or overlapping interest with what I mentioned. I’m referring more to my impression of the overall narrative of the community (as the sum of the things I see discussed).

It is very interesting you ask this question. In my "vision" of future of programming, I wonder how we can find some tools/languages which helps abstract very diverse kinds of programming artifacts : data, algorithms, persistence, infrastructures, scientific models, hardware, network connections, etc. I imagine that it would be greet to have a plateform that helps one design her own working abstractions for her problems at hand.

And my coding background is very diverse. In no particular order (neither time nor importance order) : scientific research, scientific algorithms, image processing/analysis, frontend developpement from old raw HTML/JavaScript to Angular or Vue.js, database, cloud (docker, kubernetes, serverless), 3D display, various web technologies, compilation, building, CI/CD, desktop software, WebAssembly, teaching, workshops for kids (with Scratch), embedded programming, music composition, sound processing, machine learning, visualisation, tooling, command line tools... So I wonder how we can imagine a future of programming that will benefit to all this diverse ways to do programming. Diverse by the tasks done but also diverse by the persons and their mindset that do it.

from my perspective, the important part is not necessarily what angle to approach the problem, but more defining what the problem really is and addressing it from a low level. Why is programming hard? What’s the reason that most people aren’t cracking open VS Code the way they might comfortably put together an Excel calculation?

I like Bret Victor’s perspective, that programming is blindly manipulating symbols. In order to code up a function or UI or whatever we’re creating, we have to emulate the language’s behaviour in our heads and reverse-engineer the solution from that. We’re iterating on the problem, but the procedure and the specification are both entirely in our heads and that requires a lot of knowledge and the ability to manipulate and combine mental models and abstract concepts. That’s a pretty heavy load.

I think, there is low , to no consensuses to what "the future" pf programming looks like, even and especially in this small group. Trying to frame something common could be an interesting exercise.

oh yeah for sure, but that's the fun bit - exploring everyone's perspective on where we're going!
