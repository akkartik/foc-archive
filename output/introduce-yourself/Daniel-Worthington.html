:wave: Hello! I'm Daniel, and my passion is for design tools. Specifically, I’m very interested in tools that allow designers to have more autonomy, allowing them to ship things and freeing them from relying on engineers. I’m a designer and engineer myself, currently working at InVision as an engineer on the <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/design-system-manager">Design System Manager</a> team.<br/><br/>My big project at the moment is to articulate the vision I have been working on for the last few years in a meaningful way. It’s all about making it possible for designers to build user interfaces and collaborate with engineers rather than draw pictures of things and then “hand off” to engineers. Realizing this vision would involve creating several new tools, and — maybe more important — a new way of thinking about what designers are responsible for and how they collaborate with engineers.
