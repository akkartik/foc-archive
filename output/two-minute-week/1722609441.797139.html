Another major feature implemented - the <em>toolbar</em>. I really love the toolbar system used by Vlojure. I never used it personally but I like the idea of many customizable bars. Eventually I'd like to make this one more flexible as well... The animations behave slightly differently than most docks I know (Cairo, Mac OS) - instead of zooming all nearby elements (in a gaussian-distribution like pattern), only the one under the cursor is enlarged. I think this contrast makes it clearer to which action will be selected by clicking. The radar animation also got some love - it now shows the paths to nearby objects, connection name and animates slightly more smoothly.
