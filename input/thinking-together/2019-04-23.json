So I finally read it. And then I read Christopher Hall’s thesis (<http:\/\/www.christopherkhall.com\/Dissertation.pdf>), which is basically a not even that much longer version of the paper.\n\nI find it quite interesting. The storage format is really well thought out and has some interesting affordances for use cases I didn’t expect to be served by a storage format directly, but now after reading make a lot of sense to me.\n\nNot much has happened since the release of the paper it seems. Google Scholar only found one referencing paper, unsurprisingly one that’s also mentioned in <@UCQ4BBFQ9>’s blog post, and which is a critique to a paper <@UEH6T3RJB> has his name on. We’re all here in this together it seems. :-)\n\nThe website talks about open source (still pending university’s approval) and standardization. But given the status of the site it could equally likely be that the author has moved on.\n\nHas anybody done anything with Infra, or knows more about what has happened or is happening with it?\nAnd what are your thoughts about Infra?",
