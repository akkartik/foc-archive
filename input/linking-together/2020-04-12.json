I propose the default format to be a video*, even if it's to a static image, I feel that video can be consumed in more contexts than text and people are less blocked by an open mic than an empty page. *I propose the default length to be 2 minutes*. If someone wants to write instead it's ok, but I can watch the videos while I cook, while I have breakfast or on the couch, reading requires (at least for me) a more specific setup and mindset, also it's good to get to know other people, at least their voices and to start training your presentation skills :slightly_smiling_face: what do you think? should we use the feedback channel or create a #standup channel of sorts?",
