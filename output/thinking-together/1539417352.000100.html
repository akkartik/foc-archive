Listening to the lastest podcast: Sustaining the Underfunded and a few comments<br/><br/>A few random comments<br/><br/>the first was I was surprised no discussion about how money might ruin open source. my example would be I have this fiction that YouTube has ruined certain things. I go there and it feels like a dumpster fire of random people trying to make their random channel which seem to be mostly trying to chase money .  Like I feel like youtube would be 1000x better if there was no money. I'm probably wrong and I certainly enjoy a few good channels but the bad outweight the good. As a good (bad) example I found a large set of music mix channels that are just girls in bikinis in the tropics set to random mixes. There's nothing wrong with that idea until I realized all the mixes are basically the same music and even the clips are the same clips. u wouldnt doubt that it's auto generated. As another example the WatchMojo channel which is like linkbait videos . just ever random topic they can think of and I don't think either of those would exist with YouTube wasn't paying rev share.<br/><br/>so ... with open source , imagine a fund existed. I'd expect at some point people would try to game the fund?<br/><br/>
