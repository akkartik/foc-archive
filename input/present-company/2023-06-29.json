We wrote and ran games on the Z80, which we couldn't have done on the mainframe, where response times for a simple command were about a minute (I couldn't try at night!). On the other hand, I used the mainframe for doing my math homework, solving linear equations for six unknowns (in APL) with the same reponse time of a minute, which I found impressive. The next day, I decided that with that machine, I could go beyond the scale of my math homework. 50 unknowns, no problem - still one minute.
