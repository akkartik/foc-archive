Now do you know by any chance this apple knowledge navigator Video form 1987 : <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HGYFEI6uLy0>\nWhat do you think about her usage of Notion when comparing it to the knowledge navigator? What do you think when comparing your personal knowledge management workflow ( roam, zettelkasten, emacs, vim ...) with hers? What aspects do you like of her example notion usage and what might be missing or completely unthinkable in the notion representation? Thanks for your thoughts! Ah a bonus question: do you have a \"peoples database\" only for professional contacts or personal too? Both mixed? If not I would be curious how you manage\/organize that. Thanks!",
