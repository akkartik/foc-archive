Hi all! I'm Grey from San Diego, CA. I stumbled upon the community after getting into digital gardens and reading lots of Maggie Appleton's articles. Ironically, we've been doing a version of #linking-together at my day job for the last couple of years, so it's great to see so many people posting about all these topics.<br/>I've been interested in technology and art for a long time. I did well with programming in high school but didn't take it up as a profession until college. I started with graphic design, then moved into web design, front end, backend, and devops. I enjoy building with others, and love to see how people are continuing to use programming/the Internet as a creative medium. Other interests: cooking, reading, and writing content that past me would have found helpful :technologist:
