Hi all,<br/>for those who don't yet know, brother and I are working on <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev">Wasp</a> - a DSL (domain specific language) for building web apps with as little boilerplate as possible. It is open-source and integrates with React/Node.js/Prisma.<br/>Main hypothesis of the experiment: What if web framework was a DSL (we are not the first ones to try this!)?<br/><br/>About half a year ago I posted a prototype here, and now we have released an Alpha! It is still very early, but we have docs, it can be properly installed, and you can build an app (though it still misses many important features).<br/><br/>Goal of the project and our focus is to make developing web apps as easy as possible, while still being flexible enough to be used for real projects in production. In that sense, I think it should be an ok fit for FoC, since it should allow developers who are not very experienced in web development to build a full-stack production-ready web app by themselves. It does add one more layer of abstraction, but the goal is to reduce knowledge barrier.<br/>Bigger, crazier vision is to one day also build a no-code visual editor on top of Wasp, which would allow non-developers to participate alongside developers. We are thinking this could work very good with Wasp since it is declarative, and if we manage to capture big portion of web app functionality in this declarative code, it could be easier to build such editor on top.<br/><br/>When using Wasp, you write code in Wasp (declarative) and Javascript together.<br/>Compiler implemented in Haskell compiles/transpiles the source code of Wasp project into a human-readable JS based web app (which you don't care about unless you decide to eject -&gt; take the code and leave Wasp).<br/><br/>We started working on Wasp about a year ago, first as a side project and then full time (we are bootstraping), and we are excited to see how far we can get with the whole concept! Right now we are trying to get first testers and contributors (actually got our first contributor couple of days ago wohooo!), while we also keep developing Wasp.<br/><br/>Webpage: <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev">https://wasp-lang.dev</a><br/>Docs: <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/">https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/</a><br/>Todo App tutorial: <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorials/todo-app">https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorials/todo-app</a> &lt;- probably best place to get started and try it out<br/>Github repo: <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp">https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp</a><br/><br/>Thanks for any feedback!

Reminds me a bit of Rails or Sinatra.  Nice work :slightly_smiling_face:

Hey man, I like your thought here and definitely like how you guys have thought of it as a DSL with a compiler creating the output. One thing I have found out as these sort of websites grow in complexity is that it becomes really hard to reason about how components are wired together. Like if you have n number of pages referring m different components, you have n * m different components getting referred and with each layer of recursion on inclusion and cross referencing this really becomes an unwieldly graph. Have you thought about any way to control this kind of complexity? Curious because it is a problem I’m trying to reason about and solve as it reappears in many software engineering contexts.<br/><br/>Another way I might frame is that, have you thought of any visual ways to represent the dependency graph of the components that the compiler weaves.

Hey <span style="background-color:#ccf">@prax08</span>, thanks for nice words! We haven't thought about that specific problem so far, we are now more focusing on the general "overview" logic, gluing stuff together in the app.<br/>Regarding view logic, we are sticking with React, which I didn't feel much problems with so far -&gt; it composes really nicely and it is very simple. Hard part is state management, especially using server state on the client, so that is something we are focusing more on (via Queries/Actions).<br/><br/>Regarding having a graph of visual components, I can imagine it being complicated in some apps (although I would expect it to look more or less like a tree, in most cases), but how does that manifest as a problem when writing a project? If each, let's say React component, has clearly defined responsibilities, it does not matter where it is used, right? I mean, its usage in various places should not increase complexity.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Martin Sosic</span> Your tool will go a long way towards removing some pain points when doing web page creation. The problem I was trying to get at is that when the hierarchies start forming, things become really hard to instrument without reaching in through a lot of levels. Like there would be a need to put data in and take it out by going through a lot of cycles. That aspect also spawns this other related idea that things will become polymorphic in the presence of particular contexts. These two then gets braided together and it becomes a bit too hard to instrument with text based programming. I’m probably not making myself particularly clear there unless you have bumped into the problem.<br/><br/>Tree like hierarchies alleviate this problem to a certain level except when the cyclicality becomes a dominant mode in the interface. What I find cool with your start is that you have a ground where you can have the compiler generate the dependency graph and make it a first class entity to understand the (cyclomatic) complexity of your codebase.
