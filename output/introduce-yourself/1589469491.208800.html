Hi FOC - I'm Tyler, a seasoned developer. I've worked east cost, west coast, written browser code, systems code, and pretty much everything in between. But my real passion is developer productivity. If anybody has any questions about being more productive, or just wants to throw some ideas around, I'd love to talk to you.

Hi Tyler! Welcome! And I do have a question: What do you think is the number 1 impediment to developer productivity for most people such that once removed, they're much more effective? Asked another, what's the low-hanging fruit in your experience for most (maybe not necessarily as seasoned as you are) developers?

From my POV, one of the big ones is getting better with tools.  You should be able to navigate to any function in your code with a few keystrokes/bring up any file.  You should be able to do complex editing easily without reaching for the mouse.  You should have a project that you can edit/launch/debug in seconds.  Those things are important and often get overlooked.

Along those lines, why hasn’t our developer tooling converged into fewer tools? I suppose React consolidated a lot, but there’s still so much overhead for starting a new project.

How much learning curve are people usually willing to put up with for a new productivity tool? I never learnt vim (properly, I can edit and save) because it always felt like an unnecessarily large investment for that particular task. If I took all those tasks together, and all future tasks, almost any learning curve is probably worth it.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chet Corcos</span> Bolierplate is a tough one, especially for things like C++.  There is always setup/config/makefile time that is tedious and error prone.  Building starter projects and libraries of common pieces is a good approach to that.<br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Knott</span> Not to be a Vim zealot, but learning it was a turning point for me.  I tried a couple of times, but when I finally put in the effort I think I became much more productive.  Part of that was just mindset.  I realized that if I could be so much better just editing text, what else was I missing?  That led me down the path of figuring out jumplists, tagging, file search, etc.  I did a lot of that stuff before, but Vim taught me that there is often a better way if you look for it.  I wasted a lot of years reaching for the mouse.....

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ken Kan</span>: Exchanging ideas with other productive people for sure. “Exchanging” doesn't have to be bidirectional though, even reading the writings of productive people helps a lot. <br/>The lowest hanging fruit in my experience is reading this book: <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/">http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/</a>. The original unix developers are some of the most productive programmers I've ever seen, in large part because of their design skills.<br/>I agree with Chris about the importance of proficiency with tools and I'll add also the importance of making your own tools.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chet Corcos</span>: I'm not sure what tradeoff you're talking about. Boilerplate code is rather minimal in the big picture of productivity in my experience, there's much bigger game to hunt. <br/>Developer tooling has its current variety because software is used in a variety of environments. What works well for one situation might not work so well for another.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Knott</span>: Most people aren't willing to put in any more time than they absolutely must. If they need to learn a tool for a grade or a job or a project, then they'll do it. But learning a tool or technique just because it seems like it'll pay off? That's rare.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tyler Adams</span> there’s usually a tension between having some logic that is simple to use with a default functionality, but then there are endless configuration options. Or, the same logic could be composed of 20 different pieces that requires some boilerplate for the default functionality but then also let’s you change the functionality directly by how the pieces compose vs a bunch of configuration options.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chet Corcos</span> Config (with defaults) is used to enable a tool to solve a bounded problem easily. Composition, which may include boiler plate, is used to enable a collection of tools to solve unbounded problems. A unix pipeline is a good example of managing the tension properly. Each step in the pipeline is a command with configurable options that easily solves a bounded problem (ex grep finds lines matching a regex), and unix itself permits composition to solve an unbounded problem (a pipeline runs an arbitrary program).

Interesting. And then there's <tt>awk</tt>... feels like a configuration options, but then in the arguments is a language which can be composed haha.
