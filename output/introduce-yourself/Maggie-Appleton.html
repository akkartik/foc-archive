:wave:  Hi folks. Surprised I didn’t find this community sooner, but glad this is a thing!<br/><br/>I’m an art director, designer, and mediocre dev in London. Currently working at <a href="http://egghead.io">egghead.io</a> (web dev educational platform) where I spend a lot of time designing and illustrating metaphors for programming concepts. Also helped co-create a book that uses visual diagrams to explain javascript: <a href="http://justjavascript.com">justjavascript.com</a>. That project sent me down the rabbit hole of researching visual programming languages and alternate programming mediums. I was already a Victor/Kay/Engelbart/Xanadu obsessive, so it all comes full circle.<br/><br/>I’m also a cultural anthropologist by training, and headed in an MSc in digital anthropology at UCL. Interested in the cultural dynamics of programming communities – specifically JavaScript-land since that’s where I tend to hang out. Glad to have found this corner of the web and always up for a chat with folks interested in the same topics.
