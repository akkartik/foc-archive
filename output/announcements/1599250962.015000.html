Hey all! :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/><b><a href="https://medium.com/polygonflow/announcing-polygonflow-f48e9c066f85">Polygonflow</a><b> is seeking an experienced </b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1964621780/">UI/UX Designer</a></b> to work on a visual programming language and tools library for Computer Graphics artists.  We're a small team based in Sweden, and WFH is also on the table, even after COVID.<br/>Having worked closely with the core engineering/product/design teams at <b><a href="https://quixel.com/">Quixel | Epic Games</a></b>, I have been assuming this role up until now at Polygonflow, but with the team now being fairly sized (14), this role is clearly in need of someone with a more granular idea of the bigger picture on what a node bases visual programming interface should look like, and more time committed to researching what the future of visual programming will look like. And I'm also starting to hit my UI/UX limits, as that's not my background, so help! :smile:<br/><br/>We have a fairly good idea of the problems we want to solve, but some parts are still a bit in the air (<em>like how simple can a for loop be in a node editor</em>), and a fresh pair of eyes would certainly be of huge help here. Besides a visual programming interface, we're also working on a tools library, where UI/UX design decisions are also going to require lots of work to make all sorts of small utility tools for artists as easy as they can be.<br/><br/>If UI/UX is your passion, and you'd love to work at a fully-funded, diverse and chill startup, please get in touch! :raised_hand:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1964621780/">https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1964621780/</a>
