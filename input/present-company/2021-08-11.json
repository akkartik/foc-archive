I’ve been chipping away (mostly solo) for a while on a FoC-related project for people with disabilities, based on some personal connections to the issues we’re solving &amp; frustrations with available technology. The core concepts have benefited a lot from gleanings from this chat and others in this space, and it looks like we (me + cofounder) have a good shot to take it from prototype to production aided by NSF grant funding.\n\nThe big question right now is we’re considering taking it in a much more open source direction for the next phase, with the _hypothesis_ that this will be a better bet for the long term success &amp; growth of our project (not just the “right thing to do”). If anyone has experience you think would inform this decision - open source maintenance\/community development, commercialization models, massive flameouts, etc - let me know if you’d be up for a chat to either egg me on or try &amp; talk me out of it. :slightly_smiling_face: Many thanks!",
