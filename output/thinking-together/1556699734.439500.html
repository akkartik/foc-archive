And as a final note, it’s worth mentioning that although simplicity is correlated with comprehensibility, simple abstractions are not necessarily easy to understand. A dire case of this is “monads” in Haskell, which are conceptually simple but yet are confusing at first because we cannot analogise them with everyday ideas. Many simple abstractions <b>are</b> easy to understand however, such as a “List” abstraction or a “sum” abstraction (to sum a list).
