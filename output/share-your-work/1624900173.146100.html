Looking for a research assistant. DM me a resume and/or portfolio if youâ€™re interested. May be especially interesting for people interested in tools for thought and Web3. Here are some of the core questions we're pursuing: <br/><br/>What is the data structure of a graph built to facilitate collaborative knowledge synthesis? What sorts of implicit metadata could you capture from people's behaviors? How do you create powerful interfaces for structuring thought into a knowledge graph? What user behaviors are people doing already that specifies structure that is not being instantiated into a structure? <a href="https://twitter.com/roberthaisfield/status/1405557321074233344?s=21">https://twitter.com/roberthaisfield/status/1405557321074233344?s=21</a>
