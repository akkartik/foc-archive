If you're in this channel, that probably means you're familiar with our <a href="https://github.com/futureofcoding/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> (and maybe even the work-in-progress <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/member-handbook">Member Handbook</a>). One of the guidelines outlined in both places is that the first post from a new member should go in #introduce-yourself. This post should not be used to promote a startup, unless the post also includes something that is super on-topic for our community, like a deep technical exploration of their domain.<br/><br/>We recently had a post in #introduce-yourself that didn't fit within this guideline. I posted a reply saying that that was the case, and then the OP posted an acknowledgement.<br/><br/>I decided to delete these message, so that other folks coming to the community, heading in to #introduce-yourself to make their first post, would only see good examples and not bad examples. (In my estimation, the sort of people who skip the <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/community">fairly clearly signposted</a> request to check the Member Handbook before joining would probably also skip the replies to previous posts saying, "Hi friend, bad post!")<br/><br/>For the sake of posterity and transparency, I'll include the now-deleted thread in a reply to this post. For the sake of mischievous tricksterdom, the inclusion will take the form of a screenshot, since that will boil the blood of a handful of folks here, I just know it. :)
