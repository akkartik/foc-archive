Those are rather connected. \n\nUnderstanding how the brain works more does not necessarily get us to understand how understanding works. Even if it did though, translating from the brains neural circuits with their causal mechanisms to software based syntatic simulation doesn't guarantee there is understanding.\n\nSearle's view is that those neuronal causal firing are necessary. In other words hardware based AI is possible, but not software. Or put anything way, no amount of syntatic manipulation gives you semantics. Of course others disagree. Lots of cognitive scientist\/philosophers just don't believe there is anything like understanding at all. \n\nYou might not be interested in any of this and that is okay.

Those are rather connected. \n\nUnderstanding how the brain works more does not necessarily get us to understand how understanding works. Even if it did though, translating from the brains neural circuits with their causal mechanisms to software based syntatic simulation doesn't guarantee there is understanding.\n\nSearle's view is that those neuronal causal firing are necessary. In other words hardware based AI is possible, but not software. Or put anything way, no amount of syntatic manipulation gives you semantics. Of course others disagree. Lots of cognitive scientist\/philosophers just don't believe there is anything like understanding at all. \n\nYou might not be interested in any of this and that is okay. But I think these crucial if we want to create some ai with actual understanding."

Pulumi seems the same, going by tutorials like <https:\/\/www.pulumi.com\/docs\/tutorials\/aws\/ec2-webserver>. Can someone point me at a more complex scenario that it can handle?\n\nI'd like to create a host, then monitor its health for 60 seconds before creating a second identical host. Does Pulumi or any other infrastructure-as-code allow me to do that? If I'm reading it right, the declarative-code article above has the same issues with Pulumi.",
