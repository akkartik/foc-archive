For example, you might search for a \"user\", but then refine that search to a \"banned user\". Note that \"banned\" and \"user\" are not _necessarily_ independent tags. Just because someone is a \"banned user\" and a \"father\" doesn't mean they're a \"banned father\" as well. The adjective \"banned\" could specifically relate to the noun \"user\".\n\nOr a slightly clearer example: someone who is both a \"skilled baker\" and a \"writer\" is not necessarily a \"skilled writer\".\n\nI'm now wondering whether an understanding of (basic) linguistics is necessary to develop a good tagging system. After all, our mission is to adapt programming languages to the human mind :thinking_face:.\n\nThis is part of my search for \"an ideal model for information\" that readers might remember from a few weeks ago.",

If `#skilled_baker` is an atomic tag, then you can't add qualifiers (extra adjectives) programmatically, unless you feel like playing with string parsing. I feel like qualifiers could be really important in a tag-based programming system: you can use it to organise\/sort information *within a specific context* (noun), i.e. you don't pollute the global tag space and thereby risk the accidental inclusion of an entity into some faraway dataset that happened to use the same qualifier. You can use qualifiers to programmatically sort your `#user`s into `#free` `#user`s and `#premium` `#user`s.\n• (semantic) To me, this is the \"graph view\" of the problem. A graph-based model is an alternative to a tag-based model, in my mind (though some might argue you can combine them or switch between them). Some people are doing graphs, but I'm personally trying to avoid graphs where possible.\n• (statistical 1) This is about code (inference), not merely data! I think code is an important layer, but we can (and should) keep the layers separate. Code is not a tag, but code can _apply_ tags. That still leaves us with the original question of what the tagging model should be.\n• (statistical 2) Ditto.",
