Hello I found this community through YouTube rabbit-holes and research dives across google which lead me to a talk on the dion systems by allen webster and ryan fluery because I am researching interesting and new ways of representing ideas and thoughts into code or anything machine readable.<br/>I am very much interested in the ideas around language design and rethinking how software engineering is done. It seems as though people have forgotten that computers are simply tools that we manipulate to solve problems for us.<br/>Having more interesting ways to represents ideas and thoughts allows for more interesting solutions and a more intuitive separation of work amongst dev teams.<br/>I m curious about representing in formal mathematical definitions and implementing (and challenging) this definitions in code, essentially making PLs a translation of formal ideas of thought.<br/><br/>P. S. I m pretty young and still studying and hoping to complete my degree next year and start my masters, I hope my questions and lack of in-depth knowledge won't become a hinderance
