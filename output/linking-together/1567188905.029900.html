Excel is a very successful product, but it isn't perfect, and there were many innovations on the way that have not received proper credit. Excel is now a fairly bloated product and i think successive versions are getting harder to use. The spreadsheet does have many fundamental features worth copying, and i have done so in my Beads language: 1) protected, extended arithmetic 2) automatic natural order of recalculation/refresh, 3) no object creation, all things already exist already, they just might not have a value yet
