Well brendan should know. The pioneers of scripting languages don't get their proper credit. Before AS2 there was Lingo and before that there were some other projects that were around hypercard time that allowed people to do multimedia on PC's. VideoWorks's (1985) sequel, Macromedia director 3 (1993), was huge in its day; cost hundreds in a fancy box designed by Clement Mok, back when people spent big money on boxes. These early scripting languages predate Java and JS. They had triggering on mouse clicks. The CDROM business, Random House/Living Books, Myst, etc., created a whole industry of multimedia that forever changed what computers were considered capable of doing. Broderbund was a key company in this phase; they made kids/educational products, which drove the entire market. Desktop people were stuck in silent spreadsheets, but now you had animation, and stereo sound. It sold a ton of PC's. Millions of PC's were sold, just via Myst alone. It was a pre-rendered 3D game that ran on machines with no 3D hardware, and used to great effect the fog filters of Strata and had a great soundtrack. Because there was so much copying done between the early products, and because the companies were so unstable and getting absorbed it is hard to give proper credit. JS didn't come out until 1995 long after these multimedia scripting products which must have been known to the JS team at Netscape. Marc Canter and his team were really big pioneers, and i wish more people would acknowledge how instrumental these tools were in creating a software revolution <a href="http://lingoworkshop.com/articles/history">http://lingoworkshop.com/articles/history</a>
