Hi, all! My name is Nathan Schulzke. I first started programming as a 10-year-old with a copy of Macromedia Flash. Building silly Flash games as a pre-teen doesn't look like much of an educational experience to typical modern educators, but I firmly attribute my success in learning math, logic, and linguistics to early experiments in programming. Because coding was so foundational for me, it has always been surprising and disappointing how few kids get into programming, and how many CS college students find little to no enjoyment in it.<br/><br/>Two summers ago I taught at a coding camp, which proved to be a turning point for me. I was able to observe in others the same transformation that I went through upon learning programming. I watched kids who thought they were dunces realized they could make the computer do <em>anything</em>, which gave them hope and confidence that wasn't there before. But I also observed that the programming curriculum we were given actually got in they way of learning, and only the few kids who were able to ignore the curriculum actually learned to love to code.<br/><br/>This observation led me to read everything I could find on teaching programming to kids. I read Seymour Papert, Alan Kay, and Brett Victor, and a philosophy of programming education began to take shape. I began to feel that programming could be used to solve critical educational deficits in a lot of kids, if we can only lift our vision above the C-style programming model and treat computing as the wide and varied creative field it can be. I thought I was alone in this line of thinking until the Hillel Wayne podcast ended up on Hacker News. I'm thrilled to find a group so invested in all of my favorite authors, and am excited to learn more!

Hi Nathan, welcome. I'm curious if you could elaborate on how you feel the pedagogy led your students wrong and what you think is the right approach to learning to create things with code?

A local nonprofit that works closely with the school districts in my state recruited me and others as college mentors to lead a new coding camp, with one college mentor per class of about 30 kids. They gave us a curriculum provided by a local boot camp. The result was that the entire 9-week program was dedicated to having each kid build the same website, with a bit of flexibility for styling. I had to fight the system to give the kids in my classroom freedom to pursue the projects they actually wanted to work on.<br/><br/>The perception among educators seems to be that because programming is considered a STEM field, it can be effectively taught like a math class. The teacher presents the material, the kids are assigned homework problems, and the teacher grades the resulting work. This is not how anyone that I know who loves programming learned to code. In my experience, coding is much better learned the way an artist learns to paint or a writer to write. Rather than giving the kids homework assignments specially crafted to be easy to grade, we should be giving them freedom to pursue whatever projects interest them, and provide guidance and support in helping them to choose projects that are achievable and will stretch them. I find that the things I learn actually stick with me if I discover them for myself.

I bet you'd find the same thing is true about Math! And all the rest of the STEM disciplines!

ISTM that we should be giving people tasks that are challenging but rewarding...
