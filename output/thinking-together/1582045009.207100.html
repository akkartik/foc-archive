<a href="http://hyperknowledge.org/">http://hyperknowledge.org/</a><br/>&gt;  We want to establish a Web of Knowledge. This allows to see how any idea is connected with other ideas in debates, through evidence, citations, influence, consequences, etc.<br/>&gt; There have been, and still are many attempts to create such a Web of Knowledge, and rather than be one more such attempt on our own, we want to help unify the forces of knowledge workers, both individuals and organizations, into an interoperable mesh of knowledge where everyone can contribute. We also want to make it practical to develop knowledge applications that consume and expose knowledge on this mesh.<br/>&gt; The protocol supports interoperability of knowledge at personal and organisational levels and federation of knowledge sources so that knowledge can be synthesised to augment our ability to learn, understand, to be understood, solve problems and achieve goals.
