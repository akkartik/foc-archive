Hi everyone, I'm a final year CS student thats very interested in computers and how to make them better. It's tragically easy to imagine better technology and this community and podcast seems aligned with interests in that way (even though I haven't heard many podcast episodes). Looking forward to meeting everyone else and having discussions about computers :)
