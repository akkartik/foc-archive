My first priority is finding out whether I could earn a living from doing the work I love, which seems pretty research-y. I know that there are people here in academia, and others in full-time employment, some of whom do work unrelated to "Future of Programming" and yet others who somehow do...? Can I seek your advice about what possibilities are open to me, or at least a starting point for finding out?<br/><br/>I can think of the following options:<br/>1. Software isn't actually that bad, probably just the culture of the particular company you work in, try another place<br/>2. Unfortunately many places are like this, but you should try companies that build programming tools / languages because they exist too<br/>3. You really do sound like research would suit you better, so start by looking for programs related to "Software Creation Process", plain old PL research or even HCI<br/>4. Other, obviously<br/><br/>Any thoughts?

I was in similar situation before. There are jobs which require you to do more than just manual labor. It takes time to find a good one.<br/><br/>&gt; Software isn't actually that bad, probably just the culture of the particular company you work in, try another place<br/><br/>Maybe the problems that they're trying to solve don't require this 'researcher' culture. If you find company that  solves more complicated problems, likely you will find more suitable culture.<br/><br/>&gt; 2. Unfortunately many places are like this, but you should try companies that build programming tools / languages because they exist too<br/><br/>I got huge boost when I joined Erlyvideo that develops videostreaming server in Erlang. Maybe you shouldn't narrow your search for programming tools companies? Maybe just any job that tries to solve complex problems will be good?<br/><br/>&gt; 3. You really do sound like research would suit you better, so start by looking for programs related to "Software Creation Process", plain old PL research or even HCI<br/><br/>I got an impression that it's better to dive into research after having some good experience in real world production jobs. Just to better understand the problems of today programming. Working alone on your projects might be not enough. Otherwise you may end up solving academic problems that don't really change things in production.

These are hard questions and I don't think that there's a simple answer to them. I'm still in university but will have to think about this in about a year too.<br/>One thing I can add from personal experience is that working on the "future of programming" full time didn't work out for me. I took 6 months off and focused on my ideas. Afterwards, I was disappointed because I didn't make much progress that I could show others to prove to them that I hadn't wasted my time. You could say that it doesn't matter what others say, but I found that it does matter to me. Also, working on something for weeks and then realizing that it won't work out was really depressing for me.<br/>My current plan is to get a job that's interesting but doesn't consume all my energy (maybe part time) and do researchy things as a hobby. <br/>I hope doing FoP stuff as a hobby will prevent me from feeling pressure to produce results as fast as possible. If it's just an additional thing apart from your regular contribution to society, you can do anything crazy, take as long as you like and stop whenever you like. This might be a good way to stay open-minded to all kinds of ideas and great visions.<br/>Whether or not I'll actually do this and whether it will work for me - I don't know. I'll definitively follow the discussion closely, thanks for bringing it up!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Joel Jakubovic</span> Sorry to hear you’re having a hard time - these are tough issues. I remember feeling this way and it wasn’t fun. <br/><br/>The good answer is that there are a lot of different jobs and careers - and if you don’t like any existing jobs, you can construct your own as well. That’s not to say it’s easy, but that there’s hope. <br/><br/>My current approach is freelance to pay the bills plus research with a mentor to stay focused. <br/><br/>From what you say, I’d consider switching to a less energy zapping job as a first resort. And there definitely are companies in this space that are hiring - pm me if you’re curious. Another option is to see if you can work more part time for your current or another job so as to give you more time to experiment. <br/><br/>But whatever you do, don’t doubt yourself on this point: programming is batshit crazy and is begging for improvement. There’s a lot of work to be done here.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Joel Jakubovic</span> Validation code is a sure path to questioning one's career choices.  Seen it time and again and experienced it most recently probably last week.  Sounds like your deeper concerns are connecting with colleagues and being engaged in the work.  Connection is important, else why bother?  Likewise, being digital manual labour isn't so bad if it's labour in service of a worthy end?  Fantasizing is a favorable sign, may just be that you aren't in an encouraging environment.  So outside of work, how have you tried to make fantasy into reality?  How did that feel?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Joel Jakubovic</span> sorry to hear about this struggle from you and others. My thoughts are closely aligned with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@William Taysom</span>'s comment above - connection with people is important and also 'labour in service of a worthy end'. I don't have experience in academia, but I do think in the industry there's a wide range of technologies, cultures and environments. It's possible that even with the current state of programming, a software based job can be a positive experience. It might help to start by identifying your strong preferences, e.g. the technologies/languages, scope of problem, level of autonomy, etc. you'd want to keep you engaged. I feel the actual field (e.g. programming tools vs making apps) is less important. E.g. if you don't agree with the basic design choices and you don't have autonomy over them, a 'programming tool' may not be that much fun.

Many thanks everyone, you have suggested many options I wasn't thinking of.<br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Daniel Garcia</span> I work for a self-driving car startup in Cambridge on image labelling software. Or at least I did, but in the past few months due to demos approaching we've stopped working on that and moved to shuffling data back and forth. Perhaps I have been confusing the last few months with the experience overall. Yet even when I was working on the annotation tool, I still felt hugely constrained in how I did things. (vague)<br/>I'll continue digesting everything above and give replies, thanks again.

Lots of thoughtful responses here. I'll add a couple of thoughts that hopefully haven't already been mentioned:<br/><br/>a) Be aware of the human need for status. It's a biological thing ( <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2007/march7/sapolskysr-030707.html">http://news.stanford.edu/news/2007/march7/sapolskysr-030707.html</a>), and it's at the bottom of the Maslow hierarchy. You can survive a couple of minutes without air, a few days without food and a few months without status. But you will end up with a sort of deficiency disease.<br/><br/>If this seems like a possibility, short-term solutions are unfortunately difficult. Try to find status outside work. Keep getting better at your job so that you can eventually parlay it into a higher-status one. Growing older helps too.<br/><br/>b) If you can anticipate the Architecture Astronomy argument you can also try to address it. There's a reason Joel Spolsky's article is widely known: it's actually a valid point a lot of the time. Engage with criticism you see.<br/><br/>c) The thread before yours is relevant: <a href="https://futureprogramming.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1537671606000100">https://futureprogramming.slack.com/archives/C5T9GPWFL/p1537671606000100</a>. Independent of the relative status of developers in an organization, there's a way that all developers are disempowered today: extreme division of responsibilities leading to consensual gridlock. Creators of a library often can't make changes because their users will complain. And users often can't make changes to their dependencies because of fear of forking, unnecessary complexity due to compatibility constraints and historical artifacts.<br/><br/>d) Consider slacking off on side projects at work. We've all done it from time to time; a terminal window arouses less comment than a browser open to Reddit. You'll get better as a developer, which is better for your employer and also better for your future status prospects. And it'll keep you sane. Obviously juggling with responsibilities is non-trivial, but if you're currently under-performing there's not much to lose there.<br/><br/>As I look over my list, only d) is really actionable. c) is my research project, and who knows one day I may have a solution to propose. But hopefully seeing a few possible reasons you feel as you do will help manage your motivation and energy levels.
