Further on node-based UIs, and actually looking for judgement for a change: does anyone else find themselves mainly frustrated by the layout problems, such as...<br/>• frequently needing to move sets of nodes around to make the layout more comprehensible/memorable<br/>• no easy way to add nodes in the middle of a flow without having to reorganise<br/>• zooming out far enough to get a good sense of the overall layout leaves you unable to read any labels<br/>... and how often these UIs just leave these problems as exercises for the user, without any automated assistance?<br/><br/>I love the idea of node-based code, but in practice I've yet to see systems like this that are as readable as well laid-out and formatted code. Don't get me wrong, I think most traditional textual code could be laid out and formatted much better too, but <em>in general</em> I find it easier to scan and understand the top-down flow of textual code than nodes.<br/><br/>Maybe I just haven't seen the right tools which do this better? Or maybe I'm in a tiny minority? What do folks here think? (And please forgive me if this conversation has been done to death in this Slack already, I've not seen it.)

I don't know that I'd say I'm "mainly frustrated by layout problems"... but that's largely because I'm <em>also</em> frustrated by so many other things. :sweat_smile:

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Yoz Grahame</span> I'll butt in — I don't remember which episodes contain which thoughts, and yeah there's no transcript, sorry. But this notion that <em>the interfaces to existing visual programming tools are dreadfully lacklustre</em> is a significant motivator of my work. In addition to the podcast, I've done <a href="https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex/blob/main/impressions/origami.md">some</a> writing <a href="https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex/blob/main/impressions/app-store-illustration.md">about</a> these things, and would love to dig into this subject with you.<br/><br/>One quick hit — you mentioned "these UIs just leave these problems as exercises for the user, without any automated assistance." I'm strongly of the opinion that, say, force-directed layout of nodes is directionally wrong. But I'm also in favor of assistance. Max/MSP has a couple of "clean up my layout for me" tools, for instance, which are fine on principal but (last I used them ~3 years ago) woefully underdeveloped. I long to see someone take the approach to a visual programming interface that, say, Steve Ruiz took with tldraw, or <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Elliot</span> took with his carrot editors — sweating every tiny detail of the interactions, trying to make something that feels so <em>right</em> it disappears.

One other quick one — you mentioned "zooming out far enough to get a good sense of the overall layout leaves you unable to read any labels". Yeah, this is baffling. Like, the fact that visual programming (at least of the node-wire style) typically takes place in a zoomable canvas ought to be a superpower! Like, zooming out from text code is pretty useful (eg: minimaps, or stuff like Makepad, or in some sense code folding), and that only leverages the <em>accidental</em> geometry of the syntax. If you're in a graphical canvas, you should be able to do so much more with the sense of scale.

In text you also frequently rearrange lines of text, split them to multiple lines extract a function, rename variables etc. All changes that have no effect, just to make it more pleasing, more readable. Arranging nodes is the same. It actually helps me to think and get into the flow. As for zooming out, even if I can't read any labels, I find it easier to read a graph, as I can quickly spot a "neighborhood" and be reminded what I've done there. While a text minimap is less distinct. But you do have to zoom out more often, as nodes are less compact.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dany</span> Wow, thank you both! Tons to chew on here, and it's already way past my bedtime so I'm just going to rattle off a few hurried things to explore in more depth tomorrow...<br/>1. LOVE <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span>'s <a href="https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex/blob/main/impressions/app-store-illustration.md">notes on the App Store illustration</a>, so many great points and ideas that I want to explore further<br/>2. <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dany</span>'s point about the shape of a "neighbourhood" is really interesting, makes me wonder if it's like geographic maps where you get some sense of a place by its layout. But does it work that way with visual code you haven't seen before, or is it just that you remember particular shapes after having spent some time creating and tweaking them?<br/>3. "But you do have to zoom out more often, as nodes are less compact." - yep, this is another problem I have with VPLs: much lower density

No it doesn't help with a graph I haven't seen. Different people may prefer different layouts even. Just like in textual code. To understand a graph, live coding is what helps the most. That is really the number one reason nodes and wires even exist and are so popular! Jump into every part of a program and see and edit the data. I take that over any inconveniences of nodes and wires. (for some domains?)

&gt; I’m in the minority here, but, FWIW ...<br/>I'm not sure about that. I even sympathize with a lot of this from a certain perspective, despite generally disagreeing with most of your conclusions. Not gonna nit-pick everything, but can't resist this one:<br/><br/>&gt; text-only PLs are, but, 1950’s caveman IDEs for programming<br/>yeah, like scratching surfaces with pointy sticks is actual caveman's IDE for writing, yet I still do the same thing every day with a just slightly more advanced pointy stick, and it would still be a loss to leave it behind despite all the newer tools available. :smile: There's a lot of "horses for courses" in tool selection.<br/><br/>On the overall point; like I said I think I at least understand the thought process when I look at it from the perspective of the art and craft of programming. I feel a lot of The Architect's pride in their craftsmanship coming through in that. But when I look at it from the perspective of the actual trade of writing software... giving the infinite flexibility of The Architect's powerful tools for daily work feels a bit like handing out 12 gauge shotguns to a classroom full of kindergartners to swat a fly. Will they kill it? Sure, but I wouldn't want to see the collateral damage that will come along with that.

I completely agree with your last point <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Paul Tarvydas</span>. Programmers seem to be really quick to point out the "single responsibility principle" and SOLID. But fail to see that code serves two different purposes. Trying to make  code readable, can be at best a Band-Aid.

I do think that text serves us very well when writing (simple?) expressions. Ever tried to do "node and wire" for example "c = sqrt(a <b> a + b </b> b)". You'll need at least 4 nodes and 7 wires.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> I've never used Max/MSP but I've heard about it for years, usually in the same breath as PureData (though that seems to be less popular now). There's a lovely big animation of UI on <a href="https://cycling74.com/products/max">the Max front page</a> which has so much stuff that I don't see in most VPLs, and at this point I just need to pause for a <tt>warning that I'm about to do a deeply uninformed yet loudly opinionated dive</tt> based on the lightest of first impressions...

• Most obviously: <b>visually distinctive widgets in the node graph</b>. They're gorgeous and useful and <em>aren't</em> just Text But In A Box, which is what most VPLs seem to be made of.<br/>    a. Even better, those widgets go beyond most VPLs by not just describing what the code <em>should</em> do but <em>showing what it is actually doing</em> during the running of the program. And even better, they give custom controls for manipulation during perfor... sorry, I mean: execution!<br/>    b. And, OK, that live performance thing is much more for artists, so let's stick with the visualisation part: I'm kind of obsessed with the debugger experience every time I take on a programming tool. Being able to see the data flowing through code, with appropriate visualisation depending on the component, would be bloody amazing. I want more of that. <b>Which VPLs are good at that?</b> (serious question, I'd love to find some)

And then the expand/contract things happen and oh well, there's all the Text But In A Box nodes, life without them was nice while it lasted.<br/><br/>But to give them credit, the text there seems to be doing the right job: <b>evaluating expressions that are but easier to type than draw,</b> as <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dany</span> just mentioned. So the balance between widget types makes sense. I just wish there was more visual distinctiveness there.

The worst part is that I see all these connecting lines of different textures, and I assume they're unidirectional but I have no clue what those directions are or what order this is all happening in. Also, the layout seems to be completely arbitrary: I assume that what I'm looking at is one person's setup, and they already understand the flow. It feels like a good demonstration of the difference between code that's entirely owned and maintained by one person, and code for a team. (Similar to the point <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Paul Tarvydas</span> made about the difference between commanding machines and communicating to humans.)

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Paul Tarvydas</span> Thanks so much for the amazing collection of points in <a href="https://guitarvydas.github.io/2023/11/19/The-Meaning-of-Layout.html">your blog post</a>. There's so much here! Ultimately I feel like we agree on these points (but please correct me):<br/>1. VPLs as a concept have incredible potential<br/>2. We have yet to find tools good enough for programming in them<br/>3. Architects should be able to express structures that, when zoomed out, are readable and understandable (... to visual programmers with some experience of the patterns, at least)<br/>    a. As you zoom out on a system, the view should maintain a low total number of different objects you need to understand. Sub-structures should appear as a single component/device, hiding their complexity. (I'm thinking of the Eames's famous "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0">Powers of Ten</a>" film here.)<br/>4. We don't yet have decent theory or language for how to achieve #3, beyond some basic arrangement ideas

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andrew Beyer</span> Zac Nowicki is more expert at this than I am.  He wrote the code for odin0d.  (I can give you a github repo link, if you think that would help). Here is a paraphrased version of Zac’s comments:<br/><br/>The general format is an XML encoding of mxGraph. You may be able to use that as key terms to find some resources.<br/><br/>The format tends to be mostly straightforward to consume with any off the shelf XML parser, using xpaths, etc.<br/><br/>My recommendation for iterating quickly / exploring the output is doing some edits then opening Extras -&gt; Edit Diagram to view the XML for the current page only. drawio tends to stuff a lot of things you might be interested in in the “style” attribute on nodes. Check there if you don’t see a specific attribute.

I think I've got it sorted, but the thing I noticed was that normally in mxgraph you would set custom data properties on a vertex in the <tt>mxcell</tt> 's <tt>value</tt> and if you haven't set any properties from drawio it includes <tt>value</tt> as an attribute, but as soon as you do it then removes the value attribute completely and wraps the cell in a parent object containing its label and properties
