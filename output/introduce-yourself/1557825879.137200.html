Hi everyone! I just signed to this group after listening to my third episode of <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span>'s podcast (with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span>). I don't consider myself a programmer, but as an advanced computer user. I write code for my own use (quite a bit), and I also share my code and contribute to collective developments, but I never write code that I wouldn't use myself.

My day job is scientific research, more precisely computational biophysics. I have been doing research using computers since 1989, and have witnessed both the explosion of possibilities and the loss of control that the evolution of computing technology has brought to science. I'd like to put that control back into the hands of scientists. I have two on-going projects in that area: ActivePapers (<a href="http://www.activepapers.org/">http://www.activepapers.org/</a>) is about structuring and documenting scientific methods implemented in software, and Leibniz (<a href="https://github.com/khinsen/leibniz/">https://github.com/khinsen/leibniz/</a>) is about taking scientific models out of software source code and giving them a life of their own (call it "reifying" if you need a technical term).

One of my beliefs that perhaps most of you don't share is that today's computing technology puts too much emphasis on code. For me, code is a means to an end. What I care about is scientific data and models in my work, and e-mails, e-books, contacts, music etc. otherwise. A computer for me is a tool to work with digital information, with the information being more important than the tool. Much of today's digital information is held hostage by code. This covers proprietary data formats, overly complex or undocumented data formats, and information absorbed by (and hidden in) software source code. For the specific case of scientific models, I have written a whole article about this issue: <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/3-101/v2">https://f1000research.com/articles/3-101/v2</a>.

It sounds like what you are talking about is data silos, which require glue code to interoperate (and the amount of glue code increases geometrically with number of silos). In my opinion the path forward here is a universal data protocol (like http) – which then shifts the question to – how the heck do we get people to adopt it? The world wide web is a great case study here, an interesting study of why the world adopted HTTP and HTML.

Data silos... maybe, eventually, but my immediate focus is more on data formats, data abstractions, and data-centric code. For most of the public data I have in mind (mainly scientific data, but not "big data"), Dat (<a href="https://datproject.org/">https://datproject.org/</a>) looks like a good approach for management and distribution.

Hi Konrad! A lot of us actually share a similar sentiment: that a computer should be able to be whatever people make it to be, and one should have full ownership &amp; authorship of their own data, artifacts, and tools -- and in the ways that make the most sense (e.g. not just by code &amp; programming).<br/><br/>The "computer" is a universal simulation machine that can be made to do, model, or simulate just about anything -- but somehow fails to actually provide that capability to the one using it! That's like if all scissors came in that hard plastic packaging that's darn near impossible to open without scissors!<br/><br/>Imagine a material that can be manipulated to take-on any physical properties or shape, but can <b>only</b> be manipulated by tools made from that same material. Even with only very crude tools to start with, it would not be hard make better tools (including better tool-making-tools) to whatever level of exactness one desires. -- But that's <b>essentially</b> what "software" is: the most dynamic and moldable substance possible, and created and manipulated by other software.<br/><br/>I'm working on a tool that explores such an approach, by serving as an editor &amp; viewer for software entities, including its own innards -- and thus can mold anything (including itself) in whatever way is best.

I agree that “code is a means to an end”. Code is for modelling systems. Those systems include data and behaviour. Unfortunately, to define data we need data types (or data formats etc.) and to define behaviour we need code. And these two constructs depend on each other: code manipulates data (if we don’t need that, then we don’t need computers). So helping scientists work with their data fundamentally comes down to helping them work with data types/formats and code. Sometimes that code is hidden in UI widgets (and whether this is a good thing is hotly debated). So I focus a lot on how to design programming languages and tools because working with code is simply a nightmare in today’s world. I’m not targeting scientists in particular, but I am working on how to make modelling (and comprehending) systems easier, which is something that scientists need.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span> Seems like you’re focusing on how data and code can be hosted and shared. I see this as a combination of an infrastructure problem, a data type problem, and a code problem. Its an infrastructure problem because we need better ways to host and access data/code, a data type problem because we need a common format to share data, and a code problem because we need better ways to share code (including all dependencies, in an unbreakable manner). It’s hard to tackle all these separately; I think it makes sense to focus on either the infrastructure side or the code &amp; data side first (whilst keeping the other side in mind). I’m personally focusing on code &amp; data first.

As far as the infrastructure side goes, I’m holding out for some exciting work on decentralised cloud platforms to provide a  better foundation for hosting and distribution of data and computation.

Two thoughts about the "data silo" problem.<br/><br/>1. We need more standards for interoperability of <em>basic ideas</em>, e.g. spatial ideas like points / lines / shapes, colors, time intervals and time series, units/dimensions/coordinate systems, sorted/unsorted/spatial collections, graphs / relationships, metadata, visualization concepts.... A recurring problem is that we have language-specific standards, industry-specific standards, and company-specific standards for all of these things, instead of fully general standards.<br/><br/>2. We need better standard data formats. Probably with layering - we have the layered OSI model of communications, but our data formats are usually factored minimally, sometimes in one level (a monolithic domain-specific data format) and sometimes in two levels (in the lower layer, bytes are interpreted as JSON, then the higher layer understands the dictionaries/lists in some way). If we're being generous we could say there is a third layer that interprets bytes as characters. But it seems like more standard layers than this would be valuable.

My LES/Loyc trees are an example of (2) - I factored the idea of syntax into a separate, interchangable layer from the abstract idea of a programming language, so that the language semantics can be built mostly separately from its syntax, with a transformation step between the two as needed...
