Hi all, I'd like to recommend a resource. Algebra: Chapter 0 by Aluffi. It's an abstract algebra book which takes a CT-heavy approach. I think it occupies a unique place in being the easiest CT book that's all mathematics and no programming/CS. I've read about people who try to learn CT in a rigorous way go straight to pure CT books which either contain no motivation or are full of examples from algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, etc. Aluffi is an excellent exception â€” it teaches abstract algebra and CT side-by-side (the definition of category is pg 19). In Aluffi's opinion CT and AA should be taught together from the beginning. Many programmers interested in CT (e.g. from Haskell) probably want to learn abstract algebra anyway. Also, the book has received praise for being approachable for self study, with doable exercises.
