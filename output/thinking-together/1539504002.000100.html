<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Gregg Tavares</span> YouTube is a bit bigger than GitHub and has monetization and recommendation and – most importantly – is engaging in a fundamentally different way.  Perhaps the common element is that they are online platforms were people put stuff.  (This does make them a little less similar to online platforms where people primarily do stuff e.g. play games or discuss stuff e.g. right here).  I'd claim that monetization is less important than the other differences.<br/><br/>Now about you Unity plugin, this is perfect example of how a dollar isn't worth a dollar and how cost/benefit tradeoffs lead to sort of market failure, at least a dollar priced market failure: the responsibility of accepting just isn't worth it $5-$25.  For example I think the primary way people "pay" for Open Source libraries is in dedicating their attention to learn and use them.
