        "text": "The Future is fiction since it isn't real yet.\n\nGood fiction tries to get at some great truth.\n\nThe first step in trying to do something new is to give up old narratives. But you can't just drop narratives like \"the goal of a software is project is adoption\" in isolation. You have to create a new narrative in your mind, and carefully feed it in preference to the incumbent. Some writings that have helped me do that:\n\n• <http:\/\/viznut.fi\/texts-en\/resource_leak_bug_of_our_civilization.html>\n• <http:\/\/viznut.fi\/texts-en\/permacomputing.html>\n• <http:\/\/viznut.fi\/texts-en\/inverted_computer_culture.html>\nNow some contrasting words. I find permacomputing too focused on performance and waste. Bruce Sterling's idea of \"acting dead\" matters too: <https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2011\/02\/transcript-of-reboot-11-speech-by-bruce-sterling-25-6-2009>. So does accessibility as Eli points out. I care a lot about making programs Malleable or comprehensible to as many people as possible (<http:\/\/akkartik.name\/about>) But I find permacomputing is able to coexist with these ideas better than say Collapse Computing (<https:\/\/collapseos.org>). The latter may be right or wrong, the future will decide. But Permacomputing feels definitely right, a good set of principles to strive for, as you said <@UJBAJNFLK>. It's just incomplete, and worth complementing with principles from elsewhere. And that's ok. It's a good compass. I have to go against it for short periods, but if I start going in the opposite direction for a long time I find it useful to question if I'm lost.",
