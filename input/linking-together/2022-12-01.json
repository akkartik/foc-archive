No, this isn't a link to a parser library or a tech conference or a blog post about concatenative langs. But to me this is just as interesting and relevant when pondering what the future of programming ought to be.\n\nFor instance, one could think about borrowing this aesthetic, or _an_ aesthetic. What would it take for a code visualization to make use of detailed geometry and lighting\/shading\/depth cues and other expressively artistic aspects like the ones on display here? At the moment, code \"visualizations\" tend to consist of line graphs, grids of numbers, flat little circles with text centred in them, straight lines or simple s-curves, all rendered without light. The way we visualize code isn't even, like, _Gourad shaded_. And here we see something that crams incredible detail and depth into every pixel. The _images_ themselves aren't of interest â€” if someone wants to make a programming language out of skulls and leaves and reefs, my god, go as hard as you can! But for my money, it's the way these _semi-_abstract shapes are given an impression of tactility and physicality that interests me most.\n\nAnother angle would be to think about the process. Mikael generated these images using an AI. I find myself wondering \"what if this aesthetic, but for structured data?\" (When I say \"structured data\", I mean source code, cyclomatics, spreadsheets, pages in a book, ASTs, whatever you want.) Perhaps one way to approach answering that question would be exploring the space with the help of an AI. You don't need to come up with something perfect, just something worth running with. We're programmers, so we have a sense of what structured data is _in our bones_. That probably limits our thinking. It helps to get someone outside the field, someone whose bones are data-hollow, to <https:\/\/github.com\/ivanreese\/visual-programming-codex\/blob\/main\/impressions\/app-store-illustration.md|reflect your thoughts back at you in their own language>. I'm sure one of the Oblique Strategies is \"Ask an AI to do it\".",

Perhaps one way to approach answering that question would be exploring the space with the help of an AI. You don't need to come up with something perfect, just something worth running with.
