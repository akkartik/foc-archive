Hi! I'm Vergie.<br/>I'm a software engineer, I work at IT Vendor company from approximately 2 years ago, but now I already resign and got a new office.<br/>when I work as a software engineer at IT Vendor I hate doing the same thing over and over again and take much of time in development.<br/>So I found a senior that teach me a little about no-code development. I keep exploring that thing over and over. and then I create my own no-code development (still not cool enough).<br/>and apply some of less code on my company framework, and it works perfectly to cut off development time. Still need to learn more to create wonderful framework :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>I need your guidance guys :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>Thanks~
