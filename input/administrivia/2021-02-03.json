        "text": "I alluded to this <https:\/\/twitter.com\/spiralganglion\/status\/1357154967052689416|on Twitter> just now, but I figured I should share some thoughts here too.\n\nWhen I took over stewardship of the community last year, it meant doing a lot of new, ongoing work all at once, and it ended up overwhelming me in ways I didn't expect.\n\nThere were many discussions needed to arrive at a sense of how to moderate this community, and how to deal with two people who (despite their enthusiasm) were making many other folks feel unwelcome. When that exercise in diplomacy died down, I was in fact burnt out from it, but I didn't realize this at the time. I had thought to myself, \"Now that that's dealt with, I'll be able to put my energy into more generative things, like the podcast, and some new tools for us to use to organize our discussions\". But I actually didn't have any energy left.\n\nI really, really, really like making the podcast. I just don't have the capability to consistently do it _at the quality level that I held myself to_. The biggest challenge is the transcripts. Steve and I have been using a transcription service that is not great. Steve <https:\/\/futureofcoding.org\/episodes\/036#16|didn't> edit his transcripts, AFAIK. I <https:\/\/futureofcoding.org\/episodes\/045#176|extensively> edit mine. I add inline links and embeds, sure, but more than that — I rewrite what is said so that the ideas being discussed come across clearly, absent the inflection and timing of the speech. I remove aborted thoughts, or rearrange sentences, or otherwise _capture the spirit_ of each thought, rather than _the mechanical series of words robbed of their articulation_. I love the result of this editing effort, but the work is.. exhausting, time-consuming, and not enjoyable in the slightest.\n\nThis isn't my first time moderating a community, or doing a bunch of big side projects in addition to my day job. But it is my first time doing both at once, with a toddler, during a pandemic.\n\nI've spent the last 6 months figuratively rolling over and hitting the snooze button, feeling like \"I need to get up and get back to work.. but.. not _just_ yet.\" I have several interviews for the podcast recorded, one of which is mostly edited and almost ready for release. But I'm just dreading doing the transcript editing work.\n\nSo in the interest of getting the podcast going again _at all_, here's my plan. The next few episodes are going to be rougher — a bit less editing, and an unedited transcript. (The transcripts are on github, and contributions are welcome, so I might lean on that a bit more than before.)\n\nI'm also not going to pressure myself to do any new projects for the community, not for the next 6 months at least. I'll continue moderating discussions and maintaining the website and otherwise being steward. But I'm not in the position to lead us to somewhere new.\n\nFinally, I haven't been posting about Hest at all, because I haven't been working on it. That's a long story, but I think I should probably rank it higher in my list of \"things to get back to, when I can\" than initiatives for this community (like some sort of wiki \/ zettel, say). After all, that's why I came here in the first place.\n\nI hope this post isn't too much of an indulgence in your attention. Hopefully the next thing you hear from me is an announcement about a new episode of the podcast, or maybe a little 2 minute video about what I'm doing with my days. I think I'm almost ready for that again. :beers:",
