Sweet and simple. Today, you can't use TiddlyWiki without a careful study of various storage solutions and their trade-offs. I no longer recommend TiddlyWiki to non-techies for this reason.\n\nBut even leaving aside issues related to local storage, I have plenty of memories of sites (usually sites run by my employer, or by some other mid-size institution with little technical competence) that work only in some range of version numbers for some browsers, which is tiring in the long run. Right now, I have one of my employer's sites that I can't get to work in Firefox, so I need Chrome on all of my machines as well. Another weird story is <https:\/\/fun-mooc.fr\/|FUN>, which works for me with Firefox but not Chrome, whereas for a colleague, it's just the other way around. FUN officially recommends Chrome, so it's me who has the weird variant of the problem.",

It used to be a straightforward document in local storage for which the document editor happened to be the Web browser. Sweet and simple. Today, you can't use TiddlyWiki without a careful study of various storage solutions and their trade-offs. I no longer recommend TiddlyWiki to non-techies for this reason.\n\nBut even leaving aside issues related to local storage, I have plenty of memories of sites (usually sites run by my employer, or by some other mid-size institution with little technical competence) that work only in some range of version numbers for some browsers, which is tiring in the long run. Right now, I have one of my employer's sites that I can't get to work in Firefox, so I need Chrome on all of my machines as well. Another weird story is "
