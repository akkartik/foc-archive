Heyya! I'm Rainer. I'm from all over :earth_africa: but currently in Sierra Leone :flag-sl: I found you by going down the "What happened to Eve?" google-path. I would like to build a literate programming app centered around a journal / research log that's always just a keystroke away and tracks my activities to document my thought process (will probably be tightly integrated into the OS). I'm also super interested in learning / Spaced Repetition (especially enumerating "requirements/dependencies" for any lesson, to find a shortest path to a new piece of knowledge.) I'll probably just lurk here for a while, but will hopefully have some prototypes to show you some day.
