Trying to help map the cell structure of a reactive runtime. WIP this is overwhelming but it looks pretty. The clumps are modules. The concentrated rainbow arc is pointing at the stdlib. It does communicate the intense collaberation inside a module and the sparse connections between modules though.

So I got somewhat mesmerised by this and it doesn't explain the <tt>variable &lt;-&gt; cell</tt> relation at all, but it looked too magical not to use. So now its a fancy index. Clicking will open the cell under the mouse. Coloring the modules has worked well, I would like to extend the color codes to the module tabs as well to help correlate the concept that a tab is a module, but I can't fall too deep into this hole just yet. I need a graphic to explain cells and this ain't it.

ok so this I think is closer to at least depicting that some reactive variables are bundled (the fat lines). Its a closeup of the earlier chart. The variable on the left has all its dependancies unrolled. Reminds me of the tube map. Every dot is a hyperlink that takes you to the cell.<br/>I keep hearing transclusion in the literature, I thought I wasn't really doing transclusion because they are real links, but because the links don't navigate the top view I guess they are transclusion actually.

If you care to spend time further expanding on this, I need more hand-holding. There are 4 shapes - circles, squares, triangles, plus signs. There are 3 kinds of lines - solid, dashed, fat. There are several colours - orange, blue, green, red. And there's black text. My knee-jerk reaction is that each of these has a separate meaning, which I don't grok yet.

I am so glad you said that! The main point of this visualization is to provoke the reader into noticing a knowledge gap of the programming model. Those cells are clickable, so without that interaction part you can't close that gap autonomously.<br/>The interactive notebook is now published here <a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/cell-map">https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/cell-map</a><br/>Still, it would take a fair amount of detective work to solve it still. The programming model is written <a href="https://observablehq.com/documentation/cells/observable-javascript">here</a>. "Cells can be views" and "Cells can be mutables" are relevant to the symbols. The square ones are imports, you can see the cell colors change when bridging via a square. The circles are simple dataflow cells which is probably the first thing you would implement if designing a dataflow language, they are just functions (actually they can also be generators, probably that should be reflected in the symbology too as they act quite different).
