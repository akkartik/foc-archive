Hello all. I'm an assistant professor at UCF whose research primarily concerns platforms and immersive media. I co-authored a book on the Flash platform (<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/flash">https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/flash</a>) and on adventure games (<a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/adventure-games-9781501346545/">https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/adventure-games-9781501346545/</a>) and am currently working on an experimental real-time collaborative environment for authoring immersive media content and behavior. I'm very interested in broadening participation and furthering our knowledge of how to match interest, engagement and humanity with computing, and am interested in finding others who share those values. I came here by way of Eve, Codestrates, and have worked briefly with Ted Nelson and am a fan of Bret Victor's work.
