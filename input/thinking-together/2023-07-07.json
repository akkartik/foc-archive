        "text": "Say, has anyone ever tried BASIC's non-consecutive numbers for spreadsheet coordinates?\nWe programmers always laugh at spreadsheet's use of coordinates (\"like machine code without assembly\") but few users avail themselves of features to name ranges \/ structured\/hierarchical data etc.\nBut there are real annoyances with what-you-see-is-what-you count consecutive coordinates:  They _mostly_ shift correctly on insertions\/deletions, BUT one needs to grok $A4 vs. B$7 notation, which I suspect many don't.  Getting range E3:F34 boundaries for formulas _exactly_ right is always a hassle.\nSo I wonder if features like named ranges are \"premature formalization\" then maybe \"structured numbers\" in the BASIC's style could serve as more accessible \"semi-formalization\"?\n\nBASIC users quickly learnt conventions like \"increment by 10, start functions on hundreds, big modules on thousands\".  And this allowed them to avoid re-numbering almost entirely!\n(This was good UX in teletype line-editor era :printer:, and of course now we have full-screen editors and can insert\/delete — no need to \"increment from 10 to 20 so you can later insert 15\".\nBut a 2nd aspect that imho was really genius was the numbers were _stable_, helping your brain :bike::brain:.  Your transcript :scroll: had partial `LIST`ings, followed by chains of edit actions (poor man's git) + REPL experiments, and the fact that line 60 remains 60 throught helped you mentally interpret that history — making you a better debugging detective :female-detective:.  It's insane to remember what `GOSUB 437` means; easier if you _assign_ semi-systematic round `GOSUB 2100`.)\n\nSo, suppose spreadsheets let you use higher numbers\/column names freely, by skipping display of unoccupied rows\/columns.\n• If you have a long table that might grow, you won't put `=SUM(...)` computation directly beneath it; you put it at next 100 or 1000 — but it will still display close to its bottom.  And you can type the range as `10:99` from the start.\n• With some foresight allocating \"big enough\" ranges for tables, you might never run into situations where `$B7` vs. `B$7` matters.  (This means spreadsheet should become smarter yet in renumbering on insert\/delete — do shift rows\/columns, but stop at next unoccopied \"moat\".)\n• To introduce users to the idea, don't show consecutive numbers\/letters.  Even in an empty spreadsheet, after some rows\/columns, skip to some far-away numbers like 100 and 1000!\n• Perhaps it might also subsume the feature of \"freezing\" some rows\/column from scrolling?  mockup below has one fake \"scrollbar\" to suggest a portion could be scrolled separately.\nattaching a mockup to this thread (drawn in a <https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1tQt2MgCaqkJGvyPvsqxTDfo3AurgWptWBg03TZr07zo\/edit?usp=sharing|regular spreadsheet>:wink:)",
