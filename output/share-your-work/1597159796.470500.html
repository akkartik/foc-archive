<b>The open application: making websites user-editable with no special effort.</b> This is a feasibility prototype built for Svelte. The core of it is quite simple. At build time, it transforms component definitions to fetch their dependent components from a dependency store rather than importing them from the filesystem. Component source files are emitted as part of the build, and the Svelte compiler is added to the page. Now you can pull up the source of any component, make changes, and rebuild it from within the browser.<br/><br/>This week, I'm working on building experimental development tooling from within this architecture, so hopefully I'll be able to share more interesting functionality by the weekend.<br/><br/><a href="https://youtu.be/P-ZHjVa2OYk">https://youtu.be/P-ZHjVa2OYk</a>

Looks great too!<br/><br/>More than a year ago, I have try something like that, but with Vue.js and using the hot reload stuff but to compile in the browser the modifications. I haven't work again on this, but I thought to reuse it somehow. And even wonder if Svelte would also be a good fit for this kind of scenario. You have just answered that! :smile:<br/><br/>I don't really know Svelte (never code) but I really like the concept, and I have to try it. Even if for now I guess I will stick to Vue.js for most of my work.<br/><br/>Anyway, keep going, I am very impatient to see the next iteration!

My first experiments (about 18 months ago) were done with Vue and webpack hot reloading, but before long I ran into weird app blink issues. I'd make a change to one file, and an unexpectedly large portion of the screen would refresh, throwing out state that shouldn't have been thrown out. Plus, hot-reloading relies on architecture outside the browser. This prototype pushes the build and update cycle into the browser as plain JS, so it can be deployed as a static site.

Well, I mean, I used the hot reload feature only in the browser. I.e. the client side part of it. When user makes a modification in an editor hosted in the browser, it fires recompilation/rerender if the Vue template is modified without touching the data, and reload the full component if data is modified. Here is my very light proof of concept: <a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/vue-hot-reload-test-2">https://stackblitz.com/edit/vue-hot-reload-test-2</a>

Oh wow! I never found that package. I might need to dig into the internals. My Svelte implementation is naive and throws out the whole component every time. Although, I was refactoring the Svelte browser devtools into components that run inside the browser yesterday and discovered that there's a low-level API with $capture_state() and $inject_state() methods, which if they do what they say on the box, should solve the problem neatly.
