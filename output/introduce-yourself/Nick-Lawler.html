Hey y'all! Been listening to Steve's podcast for a while now and managed to meet up with him for a bit while he was in Boston. I work at a data pipeline startup, and help run both Boston's Elm Meetup and a weekly functional programming meetup with a few friends.<br/><br/>I also have a future-of-coding-esqe personal project that I've been mapping out for a while, and want to get more serious about implementing. The use case is rapidly developing and combining little personal systems for note-taking, note-organizing, goal tracking, task prioritization, etc. The system itself will be a combination visual + textual editor for a big strongly typed frp-ish program, plus a live-updating view that's a user-defined pure function of the state of the frp network. I'm trying to make it so that "if it compiles, it's deployed". I am in way over my head with this and will need all the help I can get!
