We can migrate the Slack chat room to Mattermost (which is an open source Slack clone). This would give us back our history, preserve the structure of that history, and preserve the immediacy and engagement of the chat-style interface. We can mirror the Slack chat in Mattermost and run both interfaces in parallel during the migration period.<br/><br/>At the same time, we set up a Discourse forum. Mattermost is used for chat, while Discourse is used for long format discussion. A bot will report new Discourse topics on Mattermost. The Discourse forum will be google searchable. You can change the first post in a Discourse topic into a wiki, which multiple authors can edit into an organized summary, with links to notable posts.<br/><br/>Several other organizations already do this. Mattermost has a Discourse support forum. CodeForAmerica uses both Slack and Discourse, and they have a nice Discourse post that explains the rationale: <a href="https://discourse.codeforamerica.org/t/slack-vs-discourse-and-when-to-use-each/187">https://discourse.codeforamerica.org/t/slack-vs-discourse-an&hellip;</a>.<br/><br/>There are Docker containers for Mattermost and Discourse. We could set it up on Digital Ocean.
