Hi! I'm Daniel, based in Germany. I went from Lisp to Haskell enthusiast, then got inspired by Bret Victor to try to build a functional (incremental) visual live programming system. (Did I check all buzzwords? :smile:) Considered this a failure after some years and went a little bit into freelancing. Now I'm cautiously dipping my feet again in the Future of Programming. I'm amazed at what's happened in the last years and am curious to find out what has evolved!
