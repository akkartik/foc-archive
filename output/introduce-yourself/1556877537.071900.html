Hi all, I am an art historian turned philosopher and historian of computing – . I was lucky enough to get a permanent research position at a time when I was starting to despair a bit and still feel as one of the most lucky persons when I realize I have this job. It gave me a new kind of freedom which I didn’t have in previous academic positions; and it took me quite a while to realize that.  I am very much engaged with retracing and rendering transparent through history where we are now with computing technology – as so many others; I worry a lot about this broad and disconnected field; I very much like an approach of asking rather basic questions (I guess that is the philosopher in me) which, at first sight, almost seem trivial but once one starts to dig a bit, seem to be quite hard. One main question I am currently focusing on is: What is a (computer) program? This is the guiding question of a research project I am coordinating and which involves historians, philosophers, computer scientists and some programmers. Note: the choice for "program" and not software; code; algorithm; etc is not arbitrary – I think it kind of comprises/implied these other notions. If anyone of you might be interested in this or anything else that is losely or strictly related to history and philosophy of computing and programs, please do share your thoughts/concerns/etc with me. Also: I am currently starting to collect answers from as many people as possible to the main question above and I would be happy to receive some from you too – best wishes, L

Teenage computer nerd, turned philosopher, turned programmer here. I think your question is a very subtle one. Back in my philosophy days I thought it might be interesting to run the same kind of "multiple realizability" arguments that you find in the philosophy of mind to argue for the non-reducibility of programs to, eg. patterns of activity in the hardware. These days I'm in the typed functional programming camp and like to think of programs as proofs, via the Curry-Howard isomorphism. So the next question is "what is a proof?".

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Liesbeth De Mol</span> I would be happy to help you and share some thoughts. Also I see you work in a french research lab, and as I am french too, maybe as long as it is about the meaning of things (!), it would be better to exchange in french, which I guess is less prone to interpretation errors (from me at least). But maybe in DM/email, so that we do not spam this slack. What do you think?

Here is my "Software History" video playlist on YouTube:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcxHi1cwstVANjtKFBFSomss42dDf5kpH">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcxHi1cwstVANjtKFBFSomss42dDf5kpH</a><br/><br/>In many ways, the software industry is more of a pop culture than a science or engineering field. Most professional developers know shockingly little about the history of the field, and don't care to know. As a result, there is a skewed view that newer is better, and things of the past are irrelevant or more primitive or crude form of the present. Ideas from the past are widely forgotten and reinvented every decade or two, and a lot of meaning is lost and terms redefined.<br/><br/>The playlist I'm sharing here mainly focuses on this aspect of software history. A few of the videos focus more on a particular programming topic, but paint a historical picture in doing so.<br/><br/>Some of the videos with Jim Coplien focus a lot on the history of software <b>practices</b> (e.g. Agile &amp; Scrum)

The Christopher Alexander video does not explain much about software history, but is itself a key event in software history. Alexander was looking to restore physical architecture to its more humanistic roots (find his video "spaces for the soul" on YouTube for more info). His "pattern language" theory was actually picked up by the software community, sparking a "patterns" movement which essentially sought to find patterns to build software that was more humane and useful to people. The founders of this movement formed "The Hillside Group" (find their website).<br/><br/>However, "patterns" in software quickly devolved into ways to deal with problems in the code (e.g. like shifting from how to build a kitchen or entrance or living room that promotes togetherness while respecting personal space ... to how best to nail drywall to a wood frame). The change was solidified by a book published by 4 authors commonly known as "The Gang of Four" (GoF) (look it up, it's not hard to find them). The book and it's more mechanical idea of "patterns" still today forms a foundational part of modern software ideology.<br/><br/>With this flop, some key figures in software (many from the Hillside Group) sought other ways to make software more humanistic, and as a result we have "Agile" (see the "Agile Manifesto", also easy to find).<br/><br/>The Christopher Alexander video marks his address to the software community after this patterns movement had gained traction, and the Gang of Four book had taken its course. He talks a lot about his work, and then addresses the disparagement between it and what software has done with it.

There are similar stories in software of taking a human-based idea and turning it into something mechanical and losing its human roots. This is the case with "patterns", but also with "Object Oriented Programming", which nowadays means many different things, most of them separate from it's original idea (i.e. representing human mental models directly in code, such that even a child could create meaningful programs)<br/><br/>(For more on that, research Alan Kay)

Hey <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Liesbeth De Mol</span>, this is something that I also have thought a lot about in the course of my PhD. I come at this from a programming languages perspective, but we’re all asking the same questions.

Thanks Will! I like the way your definition is wide enough to include some languages (like HTML) some do not consider as programming language.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@nicolas decoster</span> You may also enjoy the book “A Small Matter of Programming”. It provides a nice overview of the ubiquity of formal languages (e.g. legalese, smoke signals, etc.) and their relationship to end-user programming, e.g. with Excel or CAD.

Is "What is a program?" really the question? I would have framed it as "What <em>should</em> a program be?" We can set it up as we choose to.

&gt; One main question I am currently focusing on is: What is a (computer) program?<br/><br/>Brilliant question. To me the program concept is turning out be something of a diversion. We think we work with one program mostly but in reality we work with a cacophony of them and other non-programmy things (shared libraries - are they inside my program or outside?). Roughly a program seems like a static description of some automated *<b>process</b>*. I'd argue that the processes of interest mostly span slices across multiple such definitions. I'm trying to focus away from the idea of a program and instead think about the larger context of the 'system'.
