i am working myself on something that would be ideal for coding camps, and i look forward to the field test where i test it on 12 year olds and 70 year olds. Both groups are excluded at present, and the seniors have the most to offer because they know what should be built, while kids typically only know games.

I'd very much like to know the details and outcome of these tests! What kind of timeline are you looking at?

Me too! <br/>I worked as a teacher in different coding bootcamps. Iâ€™m really interested to know more about it

&gt; Both groups are excluded at present, and the seniors have the most to offer because they know what should be built, while kids typically only know games<br/><br/>I think the tool that can make games well vs. the tool that can make "what should be built" is probably very different?  My guess is most serious applications that a senior might design look more like spreadsheets, or an ECA system, and wouldn't necessarily have the primitives to make compelling games or interactive art\stories that more kid focused environments like scratch or etoys encourage.  This comes back to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span>'s comment that simplifying programming language doesn't help much, you need to build environments that empower people

One thing I've anecdotally experienced with seniors (relatively small sample size of my parents and their friends), is even if they use consumer applications daily, and have been using computers in some form for most of their lives, its common that they don't understand that they don't understand the limitations of modern computing devices, which is a big ask, but I wonder if a lot of great ideas seniors would come up with are probably the way things "should be" in computing, but are also 10x unsolved research problems stacked on top of each other :slightly_smiling_face:

this is one of the advantages of kids focusing on games, kids can be easily impressed with just moving a sprite on the screen or displaying some text, anything that allows for a little self-expression, imo seniors (and non-coding adults in general) have a higher bar

seniors are a little different in that they probably don't care about immediate employment like most adults that go to coding bootcamps do, so they would care more about what they can do to make their lives or their community better, vs younger adults that aren't retired that tend to think about "how much, javascript, python and sql can I learn to get a job"

I don't think coding bootcamps are a good place for new languages, because most of the camps i have seen are focused on getting people into commercial readiness of some kind and training on something that is bleeding edge would seem disappointing to the students because when they get out they will be likely compelled to use some very conventional language, as few beginners have design or language authority. Only powerful, established talent can buck the system and inject a new language, or the sole practitioner who doesn't care what anyone else is doing. After working on a gigantic C program for a year with 12 others, i was sick of the contamination and error injection caused by people changing interfaces, and sought a better language, and settled on Modula-2, which was so commercially productive for me i kept using it for 20 years. This is why smaller projects have very profitably used less popular languages. Even ancient technologies like LISP will sometimes show up inside products; in the hands of a skilled practitioner anything is possible.<br/><br/>that being said, it would be a lot more fun, and a lot easier, to train people in a bootcamp using one of the new languages which drastically reduces the total amount one has to learn. With a total of 20 function calls you should be able to build a chess program for an iPad and a web browser. And omniscient debugging makes it a lot less frustrating. This is the double whammy coming, which will be dramatic moment for the software industry; the combination of simplification with a major reduction in what i call the frustration of not being able to reverse an effect back to its cause.
