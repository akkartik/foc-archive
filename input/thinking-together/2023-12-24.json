Lots of people imagine moments in time advancing synchronously everywhere at once.\nYes.  And your kids have no problem saying \"while the potatoes cook, cut up the carrots\". They don't invoke monads or futures or awaits to say this, they just say it.  When they draw it on a whiteboard, it's pretty clear - one box branches out to two boxes.  Left to right.  Then, the two branches join back together into a single box.  No rules. The person drawing the branches gets to say when the branches join. The toolmaker doesn't get to dictate. The toolmaker provides a recursive canvas (a flip-chart, or an erasable whiteboard) and provides the dry-erase markers. The person doing the drawing uses the tools to say what they mean.\n\nNot everyone expresses what they mean in a good way. The people who do this well are promoted to \"Architect\" status, the rest don't get promoted.\n\n> So there's a kernel of something here, but I don't think it's quite fully baked yet. Sync vs async is too blunt to be all of the answer.\nIn a way, yes, in a way, no. My feeling is that this is quite simple and doesn't need to be complicated further.  Encapsulate units, make the units be totally independent. Function-based programming  languages do only half of the job.  It is trivial to do the rest of the job.  Preserve time-ordering and left-to-rightness and top-to-downness. Allow composition of such units (aka LEGO-ification).  Current programming languages lean solely on the LIFO meme (stack).  Simply adding a LIFO meme (queue) can break out of the step-wise (synchronous) paradigm. This is nothing new - networking protocols already do this kind of thing.  I think that we can push network protocol-ization down to the programming level.  Easily.\n\nDon't use one at the exclusion of the other. Use both. LIFO and FIFO. CALL\/RETURN and SEND.\n\nLIFO is good for expressing the innards of components, FIFO is good for expressing inter-component communication.\n\nInput and output queues are good for preserving time-ordering of data arrival and data generation.\n\n\"Programming\" is the whole enchilada.
