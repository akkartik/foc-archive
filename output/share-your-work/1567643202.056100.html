&gt; if you make a working system<br/>In defense of academics, making a practically usable system requires engineering resources that are rarely available.<br/>&gt; Please show me how functors make my tictactoe game easier to write and easier to understand<br/>Nobody knows yet. The heuristic is that mathematic elegance may one day have practical consequence. Expecting practical utility on day one would close down a lot of research avenues that might be fruitful.<br/><br/>It’s all just the practical industry vs. theoretical academic debate. There’s strengths (and weaknesses) to both approaches.

I've been thinking about this comment for a while.<br/><br/>Definitely agree with the second half. I too push back on Edward here.<br/><br/>But I think you missed my point in the first half. The fact that engineering resources are rarely available should cause us to question if the academic model is sufficient for software research. The constraints are different:<br/><br/>• We don't need much up-front infrastructure. A single person can make progress on projects in off-hours.<br/>• Longitudinal studies are exponentially more valuable than anything else.<br/>• We can't just observe the world. We have to introduce new artifacts into the world and observe how the world reacts and adapts to them over a long period.<br/><br/>So I don't think your statement is a defense of academia at all. I think it's an indictment, narrowly when it comes to computer science academia.
