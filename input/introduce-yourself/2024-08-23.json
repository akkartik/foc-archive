I'm <https:\/\/github.com\/kaBeech|Kyle>!\n\nThe Future Of Coding podcast won my heart about a year ago by being the first tech podcast I found where I got the impression that the hosts had read <https:\/\/xkcd.com\/917\/|Douglas Hofstadter>. It's my favorite podcast short of <https:\/\/cocaineandrhinestones.com\/|Cocaine &amp; Rhinestones>.\n\nI'm a Pharmacy Technician and part-time Software Engineer (slowly working towards a full-time role). I'm into punk culture, Functional Programming, and the relationship between AI and human cognition.\n\nI've been aware of the Slack for almost as long as the podcast, but I'm socially anxious and avoided joining until I had a reason to do so.
