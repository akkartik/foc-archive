Anyone wanna work through SICP with me? I tried a few years ago when I was picking up programming, but I was in over my head.<br/><br/>I think I could swing it now. It'd be cool to learn Clojure after as well.

My first time reading a classic: [Naur on programming as theory building](<a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf">https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf</a>).<br/><br/>Loved the article and disagreed with almost everything. Sharing my private thoughts without polish or much justification, in case someone's interested in a dissenting opinion :sweat_smile:<br/>- I think Naur is not quite right. It's not theory building. It's the building of a representation of reality, that in itself can be a part of reality.<br/>- My take: if programs are much more readable, and we have a set of universal constructs for thinking programs, then reading and modifying a program doesn't require an external entity. There needn't be a private theory of the program except for the program itself (and any documentation in natural language). The theory should be readable from the constraints and the words/calls used in the system.<br/>- Simplicity can be evaluated as relative length of two solutions that do the same thing.<br/>- "Theory" can be rediscovered by studying both the problem domain and the solution.<br/>- Naur's concept of the theory of a program is downright <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism">animist</a>. The theory is an entity living in the programmers that created the program, and can only be communicated by them while they are working in the program. When the program stops being worked up, the theory quickly fades and dies. No amount of program or documentation reading is going to revive it.<br/>- I think a more accurate and constructive view of programming considers it akin to an intellectual or scientific discipline, where a thread can be maintained over time through language, even if the chain is not transmitted orally.

getting some lovely blue-sky Realtalk energy from this piece on 'infrastructuring'<br/><b>Design Things and Design Thinking: Contemporary Participatory Design Challenges</b><br/>Erling Bjögvinsson, Pelle Ehn, Per-Anders Hillgren 2012<br/><a href="http://www.gobigcreativelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Contemporary-Design-Thinking-Challenges.pdf">http://www.gobigcreativelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/C&hellip;</a><br/>&gt; An infrastructure (e.g., railroad tracks, cables, or the Internet) reaches beyond the single event (temporal) and the site event (spatial); it does not need to be reinvented every time; and it is embedded into other socio-material structures. However, the infrastructure also is accessible only by participation in specific practices. [...] it is relational and becomes infrastructure in the relationships between design Things at project time and (multiple, potentially controversial) design Things in use.

Is there any research about 3d user interface? Right now we use the windows from Xerox popularized by Macbooks. But I am considering to make it as a game scene, where everything is represented as a 3d objects. I couldn't find anything related to this, or attempts before. The only close thing for this is the holograms from the sci-fi.<br/>As a reference, I am making a social network, but I want it to be a 3d. As a reference here is the prototype:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suOaUQmMSGo&amp;t=144s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suOaUQmMSGo&amp;t=144s</a><br/><br/>I also recorded the new form of interface for the crypto wallets. How the transferring tokens from your address to another is done. If there are any systematic explanation of 3d objects, I would appreciate it. :)

LLMs are forcing me to think about non-deterministic yet rational "computation".<br/><br/>Agents are beyond what traditionally computation has been. When an agent starts performing a task, and the environment changes, they need to find the balance between too much rethinking (classical decision theory) and not enough rethinking (computation).<br/><br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604050051/https://www.aaai.org/Papers/ICMAS/1995/ICMAS95-042.pdf">https://web.archive.org/web/20110604050051/https://www.aaai.&hellip;</a>

I've been kinda obsessed with this paper, "Weird Machines, Exploitability, and Provable Unexploitability" since October last year.<br/><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=8226852">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=8226852</a><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ynkWcfiwOk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ynkWcfiwOk</a><br/>(I think starting with the talk is a good idea)<br/><br/>After hearing about robust first computing I've been pondering the connection for a bit. I'm not really sure what to make of it, but there has to be some connection. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmlm6mtnSZs">this talk</a> by Dave Ackley he specifically mentions that "flipping one bit" (paraphrasing) can be enough to destroy a lot of software, which is the exact attack model that Dullien uses. It would be nice if software could maintain security invariants despite memory corruption (which Dullien proves for a small piece of software that he writes) so in that sense the two concepts allign. But I find that "continuing despite an error" or "return a best-effort answer" is the source of many security vulnerabilities, (mid example: database lookup fails, code is written in a way that forgot to handle that case, code continues anyway and returns admin data that shouldn't be shown). I wonder if any of y'all have read this or have thoughts about it. :))

I don't know, but I have my hypothesis as well as for why this and other user-empowering approaches were abandoned: the rise of PCs. In the late 80s and early 90s, the first PCs appeared and were seen as the obvious road to computing for everyone. But they were not powerful enough to run environments like Smalltalk. It's Basic we got instead. In parallel, professional high-end computing grew as well and that's where the money was. Academia followed the money.

I've just learned about Alternate Reality Kit. I've searched through the archive and it was mentioned in passing a couple of times but I don't think this article was ever posted: <a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Smith_R_1987_-_Experiences_With_The_Alternate_Reality_Kit,_An_Example_of_the_Tension_Between_Literalism_and_Magic.pdf">https://worrydream.com/refs/Smith_R_1987_-_Experiences_With_&hellip;</a> . There is also a relatively recent video upload (video comes from 87 but it was uploaded only three years ago) which shows a more mature version in action: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1HhPE0zV6g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1HhPE0zV6g</a> .<br/><br/>Its similarity to the system that I'm developing is just uncanny! I'm very interested in learning more about it. I tried to follow its history to figure out why it was abandoned but I've only been able to track that its development eventually led to the Self language (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ka4KY7TMTU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ka4KY7TMTU</a>) which honestly seems like a step back from the original. I have my theories about why it might have been abandoned (which is that educational software is hard to sell) but would love to learn more about it from the people who might know more. Or maybe there are other systems that might have been derived from it?

Pete McBreen's <em>Software Craftsmanship: The New Imperative</em> (2002).<br/><br/>Most of the book is about the consequences of distinguishing between "software engineering" (defined as armies of programmers going down a waterfall) and "software craftsmanship" (defined as small teams working incrementally). He runs deep with the craftsman metaphor, taking seriously how to make real the "apprentice" and "journeyman" stages in a software developer's career.<br/><br/>One interesting thread is that he points out how "best practices" are firmly a creation of the software engineering side of his binary, and do not satisfy craftspeople's very different trade-offs. Some by nature will wind around on their own path, custom-fitting each architectural decision to their preferences and the needs of the specific project.<br/><br/>There is overlap with our <a href="../thinking-together/1703941495.921419.html">discussion of a month ago</a>, exploring <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jack Rusher</span>'s ontology of [programming, computer science, software engineering]. It seems useful to me to further distinguish the "strong S.E." that Jack and McBreen use as definitional from the "soft S.E." which we all seem to use colloquially to mean all manner of techniques for making an application error-resistant. The work of the latter may not be intellectually engaging or novel but it lacks the qualities which make strong SE distasteful: centralization of power, treating developers interchangeably, the urge towards monoculture, a cultural belief in "training" instead of learning.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span>, in episode 9 of a podcast I can’t tell if I’m supposed to know about or not, you asked, “Where is [data] going when you’re throwing it away, and when you rewind, how does it come back?” And I don’t think it has answers that you’d want to apply directly to your situation, but <b>Feynman’s Lectures on Computing</b> comes back to the idea of reversible computing again and again with various playful metaphorical lenses. I think that at the very least it might be a nice way to take a break and think about the problem from a physicist’s perspective now and then, if this is still a problem you’re working on.

I was leafing through my father's old books when this diagram caught me off-guard.<br/>We're so used now to having an OS with apps, that it's weird to think of OS-level transitions (login-&gt;shell), inter-apps transitions (shell-&gt;vi) and inside-app transitions (vi's command&lt;-&gt;append modes) as similar things. :upside_down_face:<br/>But to a user new to computers, yes these are all "modes".

I'm looking at defining a collaboration-centered language that has sound semantics (ie semantics under composition are intentional and generally useful)<br/>My understanding is that you can only verify semantics for a specific model, so trying to define a "good enough" model<br/>Do y'all know of any papers on the tradeoffs of various "computer" models for distributed machines? Bonus points if it has time costs and resource limits built in and supports heterogeneous machines.<br/>My best guesses so far are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02762">guarded petri nets</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01894">Poly</a>

Yeah, this was a fantastic read, sad that I didn’t get to watch the keynote in person, but glad she also wrote it down.<br/><br/>One of the central myths is that programming = creating procedures (/methods/functions).    Has many consequences.

Perhaps you too are wondering if software is inherently spatial. A great paper on this topic is “Software is an Abstract Artifact” by Nurbay Irmak. I might not agree with everything written, but it is a very readable paper and a great introduction to the topic.<br/><br/>&gt; Software is a ubiquitous artifact, yet not much has been done to understand its ontological nature. There are a few accounts offered so far about the nature of software. I argue that none of those accounts give a plausible picture of the nature of software. I draw attention to the striking similarities between software and musical works. These similarities motivate to look more closely on the discussions regarding the nature of the musical works. With the lessons drawn from the ontology of musical works I offer a novel account of the nature of software. In this account, software is an abstract artifact. I elaborate the conditions under which software comes into existence; how it persists; how and on which entities its existence depends.

“Programming Paradigms for Dummies: What Every Programmer Should Know” by Peter Van Roy (2012)<br/><br/>&gt; This chapter gives an introduction to all the main programming paradigms, their un- derlying concepts, and the relationships between them. We give a broad view to help programmers choose the right concepts they need to solve the problems at hand. We give a taxonomy of almost 30 useful programming paradigms and how they are related. Most of them differ only in one or a few concepts, but this can make a world of difference in programming. We explain briefly how programming paradigms influence language design, and we show two sweet spots: dual-paradigm languages and a definitive lan- guage. We introduce the main concepts of programming languages: records, closures, independence (concurrency), and named state. We explain the main principles of data abstraction and how it lets us organize large programs. Finally, we conclude by focus- ing on concurrency, which is widely considered the hardest concept to program with. We present four little-known but important paradigms that greatly simplify concurrent programming with respect to mainstream languages: declarative concurrency (both ea- ger and lazy), functional reactive programming, discrete synchronous programming, and constraint programming. These paradigms have no race conditions and can be used in cases where no other paradigm works. We explain why for multi-core processors and we give several examples from computer music, which often uses these paradigms.<br/><a href="https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter.pdf">https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter.pdf</a>

“First Steps Towards Inferential Programming” by Scherlis and Scott (1983)<br/><br/>&gt; Logics of programs, while they have contributed significantly to our understanding of individual programs and to our knowledge of programming language design, have had disappointingly little influence on the methods by which programs are constructed and documented in practice. The reason for this, we suspect, is that the understanding embodied in these systems deals with individual programs and does not directly address the process by which. programs are constructed. By focusing attention on this process, attempting to discern the fundamental steps in the evolution of programs, we propose that it may be possible lo develop a logical system- supported by an appropriate machine<br/>&gt; environment--that will be more directly applicable to programming practice. The bencfits of such a point of view will be discussed.<br/><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William-Scherlis/publication/221330578_First_Steps_Towards_Inferential_Programming/links/577c0f9e08ae355e74f16a23/First-Steps-Towards-Inferential-Programming.pdf?origin=publication_detail#page17">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William-Scherlis/public&hellip;</a>

“Notes on Postmodern Programming” by Noble and Biddle (2002)<br/><br/>&gt; The ultimate goal of all computer science is the program. The performance of programs was once the noblest function of computer science, and computer science was indispensable to great programs. Today, programming and computer science exist in complacent isolation, and can only be rescued by the conscious cooperation and collaboration of all programmers.<br/>&gt; The universities were unable to produce this unity; and how indeed, should they have done so, since creativity cannot be taught? Designers, programmers and engineers must once again come to know and comprehend the composite character of a program, both as an entity and in terms of its various parts. Then their work will be filled with that true software spirit which, as “theory of computing”, it has lost. Universities must return to programming. The worlds of the formal methods and algorithm analysis, consisting only of logic and mathematics, must become once again a world in which things are built. If the young person who rejoices in creative activity now begins his career as in the older days by learning to program, then the unproductive “scientist” will no longer be condemned to inadequate science, for their skills will be preserved for the programming in which they can achieve great things.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Designers, programmers, engineers, we must all return to programming! There is no essential difference between the computer scientist and the programmer. The computer scientist is an exalted programmer. By the grace of Heaven and in rare moments of inspiration which transcend the will, com- puter science may unconsciously blossom from the labour of the hand, but a base in programming is essential to every computer scientist. It is there that the original source of creativity lies.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Let us therefore create a new guild of programmers without the class-distinctions that raise an arrogant barrier between programmers and computer scientists! Let us desire, conceive, and create the new program of the future together. It will combine design, user-interfaces, and programming in a single form, and will one day rise towards the heavens from the hands of a million workers as the crystalline symbol of a new and coming faith.<br/><a href="https://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~kjx/papers/nopp.pdf">https://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~kjx/papers/nopp.pdf</a>

“Behavioral Programming” by Harel, Marron, and Weiss (2012)<br/><br/>&gt; We describe an implementation-independent programming paradigm, behavioral programming, which allows programmers to build executable reactive systems from specifications of behavior that are aligned with the requirements. Behavioral programming simplifies the task of dealing with under- specification and conflicting requirements by enabling the addition of software modules that can not only add to but also modify existing behaviors. A behavioral program employs specialized programming idioms for expressing what must, may, or must not happen, and a novel method for the collective execution of the resulting scenarios. Behavioral programming grew out of the scenario-based language of live sequence charts (LSC), and is now implemented also in Java and in other environments. We illustrate the approach with detailed examples in Java and LSC, and also review recent work, including a visual trace-comprehension tool, model-checking assisted development, and extending behavioral programs to be adaptive.<br/><a href="https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~amarron/BP%20-%20CACM%20-%20Author%20version.pdf">https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~amarron/BP%20-%20CACM%20-&hellip;</a>

“Metaphor in Diagrams“ by Alan Frank Blackwell (1998)<br/><br/><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~afb21/publications/thesis/blackwell-thesis.pdf">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~afb21/publications/thesis/blackwell-thesis.pdf</a><br/><br/>&gt; Modern computer systems routinely present information to the user as a combination of text and diagrammatic images, described as “graphical user interfaces”. Practitioners and researchers in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) generally believe that the value of these diagrammatic representations is derived from metaphorical reasoning; they communicate abstract information by depicting a physical situation from which the abstractions can be inferred.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; This assumption has been prevalent in HCI research for over 20 years, but has seldom been tested experimentally. This thesis analyses the reasons why diagrams are believed to assist with abstract reasoning. It then presents the results of a series of experiments testing the contribution of metaphor to comprehension, problem solving, explanation and memory tasks carried out using a range of different diagrams.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The results indicate that explicit metaphors provide surprisingly little benefit for cognitive tasks using diagrams as an external representation. The benefits are certainly small compared to the effects of general expertise in performing computational tasks. Furthermore, the benefit of metaphor in diagram use is largely restricted to mnemonic assistance. This mnemonic effect appears to be greatest when the user of the diagram constructs his or her own metaphor, rather than being presented with a systematic metaphor of the type recommended for use in HCI.

On the criteria to be used in decomposing systems into modules by D. L.

If so, how?<br/><br/>What principles do the rest of you use to make your programs more resilient against changes in the specifications?

On the latest episode we talked about Doug Engelbart’s Augmenting Human Intellect.<br/><br/>This is a massive work. It offers a lot to think about, but also a lot of complications. While incredibly innovative, Engelbart’s work was grounded in many of the ideas of his time; the neo-wharfian hypothesis, the emphasis on logic and argumentation. What lessons can we learn from it? What things did it get wrong?<br/><br/>I think reading the paper critically does pay dividends, but definitely be ready to spend a lot of time to gain these insights.

“<em>Supporting Visual Artists in Programming through Direct Inspection and Control of Program Execution</em>” by Jingyi Li, Joel Brandt, Radomir Mech, Maneesh Agrawala, &amp; Jennifer Jacobs<br/><br/>&gt; Programming offers new opportunities for visual art creation, but understanding and manipulating the abstract representations that make programming powerful can pose challenges for artists who are accustomed to manual tools and concrete visual interaction. We hypothesize that we can reduce these barriers through programming environments that link state to visual artwork output. We created Demystified Dynamic Brushes (DDB), a tool that bidirectionally links code, numerical data, and artwork across the programming interface and the execution environment-i.e., the artist's in-progress artwork. DDB automatically records stylus input as artists draw, and stores a history of brush state and output in relation to the input. This structure enables artists to inspect current and past numerical input, state, and output and control program execution through the direct selection of visual geometric elements in the drawing canvas. An observational study suggests that artists engage in program inspection when they can visually access geometric state information on the drawing canvas in the process of manual drawing.<br/><a href="https://ecl.mat.ucsb.edu/publication/DDB">https://ecl.mat.ucsb.edu/publication/DDB</a>

Title: Technical Dimensions of Programming Systems<br/>Authors: Joel Jakubovic, Jonathan Edwards, and Tomas Petricek<br/>(who I <em>think</em> are <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Joel Jakubovic</span>, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span> and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tomas Petricek</span>, respectively)<br/><br/>This is still in review afaik, but it’s just too much of a gem for this community to wait until that’s done. If one of the authors has information about the latest revisions I’d love to know more!<br/><br/>from the abstract:<br/>&gt; Many programming systems go beyond programming languages. Programming is usually done in the context of a stateful environment, beyond just writing code, by interacting with a system through a graphical user interface. Much research effort focuses on building programming systems that are easier to use, accessible to non-experts, moldable and/or powerful, but such efforts are often disconnected. They are informal, guided by the personal vision of the authors and thus are only evaluable and comparable on the basis of individual experience using them. They fail to form a coherent body of research, since it is unclear how to build on past work. In the research world, much has been said and done that allows comparison of <em>programming languages</em>, yet no similar theory exists for <em>programming systems</em>; we believe that programming systems deserve a theory too.<br/>This paper was one of the most exciting pieces of research I’ve discovered in the last year, can’t recommend it enough! Attached is a PDF of the paper (a version of it at least) and a great single-page table (explored in detail later in the paper) which should convey some of why this is such a good fit for our community.

“Meaningful Modeling: What’s the Semantics of ‘Semantics’?” by Harel. On the importance of clear semantics for visual and modeling programming languages:<br/><br/>&gt;  In general, people tend to take diagrams too lightly, finding it difficult to consider a collection of graphics serious enough to be a language and profound enough to be the real thing. Perhaps the blame lies with the early failure of visual programming techniques to replace conventional programming languages. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; As a result, we often see the doodling phenomenon—a mindset that says diagrams are what an engineer scribbles on the back of a napkin, but the real work is done with textual languages.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Sadly, too many language designers and methodologists share this view. Some find it difficult to understand why we can’t simply add more graphical notations to a visual formalism without spoiling an easy to understand semantics by introducing special cases or concept combinations that contradict each other. For example, in private communication, people have proposed all kinds of extensions to statecharts, such as (actual quotes) a new kind of arrow that “means synchronization” and a new kind of box that “means separate-thread concurrency.”<br/>&gt; <br/><a href="https://researchgate.net/profile/Bernhard-Rumpe/publication/2956210_Meaningful_modeling_What's_the_semantics_of_semantics/links/0046352323cd69519a000000/Meaningful-modeling-Whats-the-semantics-of-semantics.pdf">https://researchgate.net/profile/Bernhard-Rumpe/publication/&hellip;</a>

Man Computer Symbiosis - J.C.R. Licklider (<a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Licklider%20-%20Man-Computer%20Symbiosis.pdf">http://worrydream.com/refs/Licklider%20-%20Man-Computer%20Symbiosis.pdf</a>)<br/><br/>In our first series of episodes going through some papers (<a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/055">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/055</a>) we discuss man-computer symbiosis.<br/><br/>If I were to put together a list of the most influential papers in computer science this would definitely make the list. The paper is really the first paper that imagines personal computing. While it may not have predicting everyone owning a computer. It definitely imagined a future that looks quite similar to the one we have today.<br/><br/>I think the other striking thing about this paper is just how practically minded it was. It says a large vision, but also talks about a way to achieve it. In some ways it feels mundane today, but I think this mundanity is actually its virtue. If you are looking for a paper to learn from for proposing your own idea in the future of coding, this is a great paper to consider. <br/><br/>Definitely worth a read

Also started reading through “Usability Analysis of Visual Programming Environments: a ‘cognitive dimensions’ framework” by Green and Petre (1996).<br/><br/>&gt; The dimensions in outline: The list of dimensions that we shall use in this paper follows. For each dimension we supply a thumb-nail description. A lengthier account of the dimension and its relation to the underlying evidence will be found in the appropriate section below.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; • <b>Abstraction Gradient</b>: What are the minimum and maximum levels of abstraction? Can fragments be encapsulated?<br/>&gt; • <b>Closeness of mapping</b>: What ‘programming games’ need to be learned?<br/>&gt; • <b>Consistency</b>: When some of the language has been learnt, how much of the rest can be inferred?<br/>&gt; • <b>Diffuseness</b>: How many symbols or graphic entities are required to express a meaning?<br/>&gt; • <b>Error-proneness</b>: Does the design of the notation induce ‘careless mistakes’?<br/>&gt; • <b>Hard mental operations</b>: Are there places where the user needs to resort to fingers or pen- cilled annotation to keep track of what’s happening?<br/>&gt; • <b>Hidden dependencies</b>: Is every dependency overtly indicated in both directions? Is the indi- cation perceptual or only symbolic?<br/>&gt; • <b>Premature commitment</b>: Do programmers have to make decisions before they have the information they need?<br/>&gt; • <b>Progressive evaluation</b>: Can a partially-complete program be executed to obtain feedback on “How am I doing”?<br/>&gt; • <b>Role-expressiveness</b>: Can the reader see how each component of a program relates to the whole?<br/>&gt; • <b>Secondary notation</b>: Can programmers use layout, colour, or other cues to convey extra meaning, above and beyond the ‘official’ semantics of the language?<br/>&gt; • <b>Viscosity</b>: How much effort is required to perform a single change?<br/>&gt; • <b>Visibility</b>: Is every part of the code simultaneously visible (assuming a large enough display), or is it at least possible to juxtapose any two parts side-by-side at will? If the code is dispersed, is it at least possible to know in what order to read it?<br/><a href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/CS589and584/CS589-papers/CogDimsPaper.pdf">https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/CS589and584/CS589-&hellip;</a>

A book called “<em>Diagramming Techniques for Analysts and Programmers”</em> (1985). Found it through a paper by David Harel. He descibed it as: <br/><br/>&gt; The state of the art on diagrammatic languages at the time can be gleaned from the book by Martin and McClure titled <em>Diagramming Techniques for Analysts and Programmers</em>. This book discussed many visual techniques, but little attention was given to the need for solid semantics and/or executability. Curiously, this book could have helped convince people that visual languages should not be taken seriously as means to actually program a system the way a standard programming language can.<br/>&gt; <br/><a href="https://archive.org/details/diagrammingtechn00mart/page/310/mode/2up">https://archive.org/details/diagrammingtechn00mart/page/310/mode/2up</a>

My first entry here is “How do Committees Invent” by Melvin Conway. If you are familiar with Conway’s Law, this is the paper that introduced it to the world. If you aren’t, Conway’s law is the following<br/><br/>&gt; Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.<br/><br/>Before reading the paper, I had never considered the way in which Conway’s law impacts not only software, but any system designed at a company. <br/><br/>The paper is short and incredibly convincing. The hierarchical workplace organization is almost always a structural mismatch for how we want our software to be. Further, it is rigid in a way we almost never desire for our software. Given Conway’s Law, if we want better software, should we be coming up with better organizational theories? Honestly, I think so.<br/><br/>He ends by asking how we can avoid this problem and says this <br/><br/>&gt; Ways must be found to reward design managers for keeping their organizations lean and flexible.<br/><br/>It is so sad to me that today people would think this meant agile, when in fact, agile is one of the very things holding us back from addressing this issue head on. &lt;/controversial-opinion&gt;<br/><br/>Highly recommend reading even if you feel you already know Conway’s law.

<b>Title</b> — <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2661136.2661154">In Search of Types</a><br/><b>Author</b> — <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=4GHlcNoAAAAJ">Stephen Kell</a><br/><br/><b>Abstract</b><br/>The concept of “type” has been used without a consistent, precise definition in discussions about programming languages for 60 years. In this essay I explore various concepts lurking behind distinct uses of this word, highlighting two traditions in which the word came into use largely independently: engineering traditions on the one hand, and those of symbolic logic on the other. These traditions are founded on differing attitudes to the nature and purpose of abstraction, but their distinct uses of “type” have never been explicitly unified. One result is that discourse <em>across</em> these traditions often finds itself at cross purposes, such as <em>overapplying</em> one sense of “type” where another is appropriate, and occasionally proceeding to draw wrong conclusions. I illustrate this with examples from well-known and justly well-regarded literature, and argue that ongoing developments in both the theory and practice of programming make now a good time to resolve these problems.<br/><br/><b>What I Like</b><br/>Kell is a very salient writer and thinker and this paper in particular helped disambiguate the notions of “type” in a way that’s been useful for my thinking. He first breaks out “data types” from “type disciplines” and explores the essential properties of both, I find this two-part distinction useful, but his deconstruction of “data types” in particular was insightful and I highly recommend at least skimming through that section for anyone working on programming systems.
