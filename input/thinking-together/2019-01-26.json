Basically if you use Swift and Apple steals your patent for AR Lenses or something then if you sue Apple over the AR Lenses they get to revoke your right to use Swift.\n\nAs for trust that reminds me of one of my first contracts. The guy I was negotiating with had \"Mr. Nice Guy\" on his business card. He was a PM at a 150 person company. There was something I was a little worried about in the contract but I told him I wasn't worried because I trusted him. His response was basically that the contract is not with him, it's with the company. He might not be around and the next person might be evil so put it in the contract.\n\nIn other words you shouldn't look at this license as \"Apple are good guys so it's safe\". You should look at it as \"If Apple turns bad how will this affect me\". People leave for one reason or another and there's no promise the new people will have the same ideals or vision.",
