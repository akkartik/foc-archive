You have to accept _some_ substrate.\n\nI'm not a fan of x86, but it is easily accessible for anyone who wants to try Mu out on a whim.\n\n&gt; Would it be correct to say Mu is a language that compiles to x86 Assembly, with the goal of being easier to use than direct x86, but not to be far removed from x86 so that the programmer is at all times aware of what the x86 machine is doing?\n\nYep! The Mu programmer can always bump down to machine code at a moment's notice, no matter how many levels of abstraction it gains over time. And all the tooling takes this capability for granted, so it can be less hermetically sealed and need less code at all levels of the stack.\n\nIf conventional stacks try to be like the _Starship Enterprise_, all gleaming chrome, Mu is designed like _Serenity_, with the ductwork hanging out.\n\n&gt; it may help to explain more x86...\n\nYeah, this is the fundamental underlying struggle. Currently the Mu Readme tries to provide a crash course on x86 in ~500 words: <https:\/\/github.com\/akkartik\/mu\/blob\/master\/Readme.md#lengthy-interlude-how-x86-instructions-compute-operands>. But I need to improve on that.\n\nThanks a lot for all the feedback, Breck!",
