Hey all!<br/>I'll preface all of this by saying I'm more of a futuristic coding enthusiast than an active researcher – I like listening to the podcast, I very much enjoy learning about different approaches to code, but at the end of the day, most if not all of my coding happens in regular old imperative textual languages.<br/><br/>That all said, my day job is not <em>entirely</em> unrelated (NDAs suck...), and I like to believe my combination of academic, professional and hobby interests should let me contribute some thoughts :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>I did implement a behavior tree based "mission control" system (think <a href="http://philserver.bplaced.net/fbe/">http://philserver.bplaced.net/fbe/</a>, but with behavior trees instead of statecharts) for my Master's Thesis, with some (sort of) unique tweaks particularly w.r.t. handling data and long-running actions – happy to share the PDF if anyone's interested.<br/><br/>Aside from that, some of my interests are:<br/>• Hardware design (both circuits and chips, i.e. VHDL/Verilog) + low-level embedded (up to and including cycle counting) software<br/>• Music/Rhythm games (think DDR or Rock Band), and the unconventional user interfaces that go along with those<br/>• Niche programming languages (I at one point wrote an APL program, and started learning some Forth, to give you a taste)
