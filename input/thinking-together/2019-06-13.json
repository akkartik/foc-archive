One is there seem to be one too many fly-by-night operators or folks who \"oops, accidentally\" lost all your money. Second, I still don't get the value proposition. Almost all applications seem better handled by third-party escrow like set-ups. In the end conflict resolution has to be in courts. Perhaps some interesting and super useful stuff will come out that will change my mind.. we'll see."
