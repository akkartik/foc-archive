So let's hold a Future of Coding conference, perhaps the first in a series. During the face-to-face meetings that will occur during this conference, we can discuss more ambitious plans to make things happen as a group. To make it "more like Burning Man", we'd like the conference to be highly participatory and interactive. Ideally, each participant is in a position to show off something that they are working on.
