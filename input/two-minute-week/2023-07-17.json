After a flow has been run, the last path can be inspected.\nWith the slider on the right you can switch between paths which have been executed before.\nIn the beginning of the video I've pressed the 'run' button multiple times, all these executions can be inspected with this slider.. and the current execution path that is being inspected can be inspected further with the slider on the bottom.",
