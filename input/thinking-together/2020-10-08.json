But right now, my sense is: there’s a lot of inspiration we can draw from cognitive psychologists up to anthropologists\/sociologists on how to study human behavior, particularly for skilled tasks. There’s a lot of theories that could be applied to programming (e.g. I’ve been thinking about working memory recently, just submitted a paper to CHI about that). And there’s a lot of methodologies that can be used to study programmers. For example, Barbara Tversky’s book _Mind in Motion_ is a really good overview of how simple experiments can build a really rich model of how people build mental models of space and action, and how action informs perception.",

But right now, my sense is: there’s a lot of inspiration we can draw from cognitive psychologists up to anthropologists\/sociologists on how to study human behavior, particularly for skilled tasks. There’s a lot of theories that could be applied to programming (e.g. I’ve been thinking about working memory recently, just submitted a paper to CHI about that). And there’s a lot of methodologies that can be used to study programmers. For example, Barbara Tversky’s book "
