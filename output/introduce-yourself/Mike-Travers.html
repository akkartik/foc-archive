Hi everyone, I՚m Mike, and I՚ve been interested in making programming  expressive and accessible for a rather long time. I was at the MIT Media Lab in its early days, working on the Vivarium Project, and also invented a visual block language that was one of the ancestors of Scratch. Since then I՚ve mostly been working on software to support scientific discovery, currently at the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. These include an early web-based notebook/VPL system called BioBike and most recently a block-based tool for building queries against knowledge graphs[*]. Most of my work is done in Clojure and before that, Common Lisp. I՚m excited to see so much new energy being devoted to improving the experience of programming.<br/><br/> [*] <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qabtwa4p6u48gfy/enflame-clojure-meetup.pdf">https://www.dropbox.com/s/qabtwa4p6u48gfy/enflame-clojure-meetup.pdf</a>
