Hello everyone! I'm excited to join this community! I’m a nurse with a strong interest in coding, and I’m eager to learn the basics and start building my skills. As someone coming from a healthcare background, I’m looking to explore how coding can complement my experience, and perhaps open up new career opportunities down the road.<br/>I’m curious to know where to begin and what resources would be best for someone just starting out. Also, I’d love to hear how others taught themselves to code and any tips you have for a beginner. Looking forward to learning from all of you!
