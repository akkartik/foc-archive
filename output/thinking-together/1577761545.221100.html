Boy that guy can sure make cute animated diagrams. There are things that are over-simplified, like the dash of the Tesla which doesn't have a rotary knob for stereo volume, which is well known to be the most ergonomic interface, or some of the crazy cellphone models that eliminate the volume rockers, but most software is too complicated, and if we are talking about software tools, they are way too complex. Dieter Rams, the great designer for Braun, did a great job of simplifying products without stripping their function. He is one of those great designers in the tradition of Henry Dreyfus, the greatest industrial designer of all time, who always built around function, then simplified.
