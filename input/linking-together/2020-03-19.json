        "text": "I don't know of a good repository of those techniques because, as with game design, they tend to be \"rediscovered\" every time someone works on a new UI, whether for a game or program or whatever, doing their best to polish the hell out of it. There are common ideas that apply very generally (eg: Fitts's law), but what I see as missing is the very tightly-targeted micro-optimization of UX in ways very particular to a specific visual language. For instance, there should be polish applied to Max\/MSP that is different from the polish applied to Pure Data since, although they are very similar when viewed from a distance, they are extremely dissimilar when you try to use both of them with virtuosity.\n\nThis is why games are a good example. There's a rich spectrum of these techniques. At the most general level, for instance, it's widely known and very obvious that you should make sure the player's inputs aren't ever dropped. When designing a platformer, and studying other platformers, you'll quickly notice that the more successful ones carefully design the scale of the world around the movement of the player character — ledge heights are set based on jump height, for instance. If your platformer needs tight timing, adding some slack to the inputs (like the \"coyote time\" example for Celeste) is a technique passed around between game developers, and maybe written down in a few places, but not obvious just from playing other games. But then there are the techniques that only apply to the exact game you're making. There aren't any guides here. But if you spend enough time on it, you'll find them, and they'll make the difference between your game feeling good and feeling _amazing_. The first Halo, for instance, had an insane level of attention paid to the acceleration curves of the joysticks, and to the physics of the vehicles. They were tuned within an inch of their life. Playing other FPS games or other games with vehicles after playing Halo, you could definitely feel that something was _off_. Even today, good luck finding a game with vehicle physics that feel as good as Halo 1 from 20 years ago. A counter example — Death Stranding. That game seemingly has _zero_ of this sort of polish applied. It feels terrible to play. But none of the tricks that made Halo feel _that_ good would transfer to Death Stranding. It's up to each team to figure out exactly what polish to apply to the exact thing they're making. This is where it turns into more of an art than a science.",
