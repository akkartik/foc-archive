I write on the topic on my blog (some relevant posts <https:\/\/blog.charliemeyer.co\/code-doesnt-happen-to-you\/|here> and <https:\/\/blog.charliemeyer.co\/errors-are-not-failures\/|here>) and I'm working on a project for a new structured editor for beginners. My hypothesis is that we can get more people excited about programming by making it easier for beginners to make projects they care about.\n\nI would love to chat with anyone in the education\/structured editor space and share notes!",
