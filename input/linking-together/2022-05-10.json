If what I'm learning isn't connected to a payoff, then I lose the stamina to wade through the problems.\"\n\nI struggle to translate that into any other discipline and have it still make sense. It sounds like wanting to learn how to write a novel in French without any interest in learning to conjugate verbs, or wanting to race horses without learning how to ride them or care for them or even saddle them, or wanting to become an MMA champion without wasting time on all those pesky punches and kicks.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a grumpy old fart, I remember when pop culture encouraged dedication and patience and learning to crawl before you run with things like \"You must complete the training\" and \"Wax on. Wax off.\""
