<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> I might even recommend as a starting point that they play around with Hopscotch (cc <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Sam John</span>) to get a core sense of what is involved in programming. At least a fun way to start! My niece went deep on it, but I also recommended it to our designer as a starting point, because I found for my niece it was very simple for her to then transition those concepts to written versions of the visual programming language (i.e. she knows what variables, logic statements, loops, event based programming  etc. are)
