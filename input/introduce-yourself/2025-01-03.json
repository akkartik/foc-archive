I came after 20 years in LA to teach architecture at a University here, and I'm going up for tenure next year.\nAs part of my creative \/ research activities my partner and I run a small jewelry company (<http:\/\/www.Xover0.com|www.Xover0.com>). To produce our pieces I use a visual programming language called Grasshoper which runs in the Rhino3d 3d modeling program, which is popular within architecture. If you know of Grasshoper you see what drew me to the Future of Coding community once I found the podcast on Spotify. \n\nI also write C# to make Grasshopper component libraries. I am the first person to write a program for the description of the Space Groups (3d symmetries) in architectural computation. (<https:\/\/www.food4rhino.com\/en\/app\/horta>) I also write a proprietary library used in the pre-processing of concrete 3d printing. \n\nI am also slowly learning APL (Dyalog). While I haven't implemented the Space Group library in APL yet, I got into it because it is trivial to generate the 3d matrices for the library with APL. I have since fallen in love with the other aspects of the language.\n\nI'm really excited to be part of the FoC community - I think it's one of the most interesting and creative spaces in computation today.",
