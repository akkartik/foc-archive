Group theory has been incredibly successful in Physics; especially atomic physics and crystallography. Group theory has been almost useless in programming. When you are trying to puzzle out a mysterious structure that you propose has symmetry, group theory can prove out your hypothesis. The Turing/Von Neumann computer with its mutable state is decidedly an asymmetric system, and thus group theory doesn't do much for you. I spent years studying abstract algebra hoping to find some wonderful nuggets, but i actually found that if you merely study the great software inventions of the past which have been neglected or ignored for usually poor marketing or timing or political reasons, you will find more gold there. Whether it be the original Visicalc, its successor TKSolver, Modula-2 and its successor Oberon 2, or even APL, PL/1, PROLOG or Spitbol or Icon, there are enough new ideas 30 years old to build an empire... As we speak, the REBOL language is being reborn into RED, and Nenad is doing a first class job on that clever piece of work.
