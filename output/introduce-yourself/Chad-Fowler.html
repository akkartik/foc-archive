Hello all.  I’m Chad, an old saxophonist turned programmer turned (after 30 years) VC with BlueYard Capital.  I spent many years in the early Ruby community.  Wrote some books, organized a bunch of conferences, helped write Ruby’s package manager, managed a bunch of people, etc.  I’m a fan of the local first software movement (I met <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Maggie Appleton</span> at the first local first conference in Berlin earlier this year).  I love things like esoteric programming languages and other fun wastes of time.  My colleague Ben Scofield and I organized a conference in Iceland in 2018 called The Future of Software Development, which makes it surprising to me that I’m only now joining this community.  I am professionally based in New York (as both a tech person and a jazz musician) but I travel constantly and hope to make it to a London meetup one of these days.  Currently in flight on the way home from London as it happens.  Though I’m a VC I still write code almost daily.  I also have some <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x04A9Fb82b53eB2e7eFC4F44B829Ae4353e19bFFb/7fXRPPhJ32SKLBRpookIZyfEKpsF0amD3g69QCzYMHI">pet ideas</a>  for generative software development that might be both interesting and controversial.  Currently spending what free time I have learning about mechanism design and game theory.
