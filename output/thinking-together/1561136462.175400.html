IMO I think what’s missing a bit here in this conversation is starting with software and working backwards to hardware. There are some great stories in the earlier days of computing where people were creating hardware implementations of VM’s to be able to efficiently run high level languages (like smalltalk, etc). This removes some of the false dichotomy around high level and low level languages. Ultimately, you just want good speed and decent control and if you can get that with a HLL and a good hardware VM … well!<br/><br/>This also meant when the floodgates to commercialization opened, microcomputers with cheaper hardware dominated and didn’t support these higher level languages (since the custom hardware was often quite pricey to make languages like smalltalk work quickly).<br/><br/><b>disclaimer: this is all my understanding from stories / hearsay from talks. Would def love more references to this kinda stuff</b>
