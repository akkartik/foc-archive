Personally, I think that all new channels should be spawned by an obvious need of several people running out of room in the #thinking-together channel and often getting in people's way. If that isn't happening a lot, then new channel creation should be resisted. (And even if it is happening, often the resultant channel dies soon after due to it only being a temporary flurry of interest.) :simple_smile: :simple_smile:
