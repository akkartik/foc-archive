After working many years on programming languages and developer tools I’ve become more and more disenchanted with the current state of affairs.  Building even simple apps seems to have become not easier over the past few decades, but harder.  Spreadsheets, the most successful end-user programming tool, is stuck with a UI that makes it almost impossible to deliver nice apps.  That’s one of the amazing but also frustrating thing about them: they’re the programming environment as well as the app you’re building rolled into one.  So one of the ways to think about what my team and I are building is a spreadsheety database at the base that a configurable frontend at the top.  I’m here to learn about people’s ideas and brainstorm.  Thank you so much for having me!",
