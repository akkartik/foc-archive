Live reload is a full restart on a program on change, which loses state, vs hot-code reloading where only changed code is reloaded which maintains program state between partial restarts.\nBut I would say Observable is a little beyond hot-reload because it's also the notebook format so program output and code is interleaved, so it that removes a context switch between IDE and program output and gives you a REPL vibe inline too. But thats as advanced as I have got so far for fast feedback. Can I do better?!"
