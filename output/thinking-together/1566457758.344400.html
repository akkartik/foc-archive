Does anyone have any knowledge of labelled transition systems or finite state processes (or LTSA)? I just discovered them whilst browsing concurrency books. They seem to be a generalization of state machines that can actually hold data (program state) within the transitions and do computations in the course of transitioning. I'm thinking they might be a decent means of reasoning about program behaviour (specifically, this book says they're good for reasoning about concurrent processes).
