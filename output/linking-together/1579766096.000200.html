Am glad to see they are getting the money in advance. I sold my painting program for Kids called Flying Colors to Turkey, via a company owned by Erdogan for a country-wide site license, and those crooks sent me zero royalties.  They told me i would be safe because Erdogan was scheduled to become prime minister. Anyway i figure i paid for one of his 1000 rooms in the largest palace in the world!  Turkish is a killer language to localize into. That dotless i is almost impossible to catch during proofreading, and there are zero words in common with English. Anyway they are pretty shrewd and a site license for a practical but unglamorous tool like Delphi is actually pretty smart. They can get a lot of good products out of that training. Way more practical to use a fully debugged tool and get pride of authorship from resulting products. I think training people on older, super stable systems is highly recommended. I don't think it is encouraging to a beginner to wrestle with errors in the core system.
