Very interesting! I'd be interested in your motivation for structured editing. In the video, you say that it prevents syntax errors, but what's the motivation behind that? Is it supposed to make it easier for beginners? More efficient for experts?<br/>Since there are a lot of other structured editors, I'd also be interested in what you do differently and how you're going to tackle the usability issues structured editors have a reputation for.<br/>Without having tried it, selection based on tree traversal seems unintuitive to me. Do you have plans to change that in the future?<br/>And a minor suggestion: You could display keyboard shortcuts in the mouse menu. That way, it'd be easier for people to transition from using the mouse to using the keyboard shortcuts.<br/>Thanks for sharing the demo :+1:

Both easier for beginners and more efficient for experts - most structure editing stuff is targeted at the former but I think there's a lot of untapped potential for the latter.<br/>The main difference between sketch n sketch and many other structure editors is that sns also supports ordinary text editing, so if there's any difficulty with the usability of structure edits you can always fall back on text editing. Personally I would rather fix usability issues than rely on a fallback, but sns is primarily a text editing system.<br/>As for the selection, up and down arrow go spatially up and down, not to parent and child, which I think is more intuitive and easier to use but somewhat more heuristic. I'd like to see how this works for others - maybe I can do a user study sometime<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback!
