Hi everyone! My name is Nicolas and I live in Toulouse, France.<br/><br/>I love coding since I first try it (maybe at 11) and do it for a living for more than twenty years (as a computer scientist and a scientist in remote sensing imaging). I like discovering and experimenting new things in computer science. My recent interests are WebAssembly, Vue.js and Rust. Several years ago I cofound "la Compagnie du Code", an organization in Toulouse that organizes workshops to give childrens the opportunity to code and practice creative computing and computationnal thinking. My main tool for that is MIT's Scratch.<br/><br/>I am convinced that for now programming is a uneccessary complicated and I am wondering how this activity can evolve to permit more people to do it, even those that are not professionnal programmers but that can benefit from a bit of programming every now and then. My guess is that one key thing to bring more people to code is visual coding. So I am here, maybe because on my search on visual programming resources I once heard of Bret Victor, then later found some reference to him in "Future of Coding" and find this initiative very inspiring! :slightly_smiling_face: I know I have <b>lots</b> of stuff to read and discuss to learn what people have expermients in that field...<br/><br/>So my vision is a visual coding platform on top of web standards. I know there are lots of visual programming semantics that have been invented/experimented since several decades, and it is not new to try to bring people to programming this way, and none has really succeeded (some more than others, but none has became a standard or is widely used). But I am convinced that there is some stuff to experiment! I have started to read some content of <a href="http://futureofcoding.org">futureofcoding.org</a> and what I have read so far is very close to my vision, in particular in <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/about#mission">https://futureofcoding.org/about#mission</a> where lots of points I should have wrote myself, except that I focus less on low level language, which is important, but for me the first step is the visual parts.<br/><br/>To conclude, I hope my trip in this slack and with the "Future of Coding" community will make me challenge my thoughts, discover some new inspiring visions and people, and experiment more on that field!

Hi!<br/> <br/>I have already posted some "introduction" more than one year ago, but as today is a kind of "coming out" for me, I post a new one (or at least an update)! :slightly_smiling_face:<br/> <br/>In fact after very busy months on some cool-but-not-FoC-related project, today I start my 100% Future of Programming life. From now on, I will be fully committed in exploring, experimenting, state-of-the-arting, discussing and, of course, building stuff in this very exiting field. I have some ideas to experiment, old prototypes to reconsider (and throw away again after picking the good parts), users to meet, existing tools and languages to explore, etc.<br/> <br/>Here are some quick words on the vision of what I would like to work on. At a very high level, it is all about tools for thought, tools to create, tools to share ideas, tools to program. More concretely, I plan to work on collaborative programming environments usable by non experts. With a focus on how to provide the more expressive/tangible/interactive/malleable views of programming artifacts. As first "proglet" representations, I am thinking to explore two well-known and successful visual ones: blocks à la Scratch and nodes'n wires à la Max/MSP. But with the ability to still use text languages when the visual ones are not appropriate (yet). As they are widespread and covers most of the technical needs, all this will first be based on web standards, which will also ease adoption and meet some common first usages. Another "minor" reason, is that I actually enjoy programming in JavaScript (and even more in Vue.js)! Ok, ok, I can hear half of you saying "oh, nooo! not the web again" and the other half saying "obviously!", while a third half (hopefully, the bigger of the three halves) doesn't understand those petty squabbles. :smile:<br/> <br/>My background is nearly 30 years of professional programming on a wide range of fields (front/back/DB/infra/science/viz/GUI...), five years as an educator for creative computing with kids and adult beginners (mainly with Scratch) and a bit of programming for music/audio (with Live and MaxMSP) some times ago.<br/> <br/>Of course, I hope to be more active in this community (especially, compared to recently). I will be very happy to read and discuss all the very interesting subjects that you all are sharing here (some I have missed recently)!
