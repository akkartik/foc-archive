Hey, I'm Howard and I'm a programmer and tech lead at <a href="http://tray.io">tray.io</a> - it's a visual programming tool which allows you to build programs that run on our platform. One of the exciting things about it is lowering the barrier to entry of programming and opening up it's reach to a larger and more diverse group of people in the world. I'm very interested in building higher levels of abstraction than the current programming languages we have today and wanted to learn more about the work other people are doing in the area and also connect with likeminded people.
