Recently shared this demo of GraphN (VPL made for 3D artists in the computer graphics industry) but forgot to share it here as well :sweat_smile:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FscRL045z4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FscRL045z4</a><br/><br/>This was a nice fun project that aimed to solve a problem that has been requested from the Autodesk Maya team for decades (not kidding): how do you drag an object on any surface, and have it position and align itself to the normal of the polygonal face under your cursor.<br/>The graph that you're seeing basically queries the mouse's screen space position, converts it to world space position, then shoots a ray from the camera to the world to detect the hit position and the orientation/normal of the position that was hit. This position + orientation is then used to set the position/rotation of the object pTorus1 in the scene.<br/><br/>The artist of course doesn't see any of this: they just have basic nodes that allow them to query such data, every node and its properties are rich with descriptions, making it easy to hover over anything and know a) what it does and b) what it expects as a connection.<br/>There's still lots of things that I'd love to improve on the user experience here. If you ask me how satisfied I am with the UX I'd say 30%, because like with any VPL there's always this impression that you're missing something so obvious yet crucial to really changing the game :smile:

That's great! It's not just Maya, but pretty much every game engine out there (e.g. Unity) could use such feature

yep :smile: I worked at Epic before founding the company behind GraphN and it was one of the most annoying thing for anyone building environments. What we're doing with GraphN is a system of "Context" where you'll be able to create tools for Maya, Unreal Engine, standalone tools or just user interfaces.<br/><br/>The core tech behind it all is Python + some accelerated arrays/math/geometry libraries, so we can do anything from folder creation to mesh processing.
