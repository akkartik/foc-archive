Presenters can use a web app, but viewers need to use a mobile app. I think everyone needs to make an account, too (though I'm not positive).\n\n2) Their business model is that viewers\/attendees pay a small fee, and they take a 25% cut of that fee. The rest of the money goes to the organizers (so, me?). They might consider other payment models, like allowing me to pay them a single fee for hosting the event (Probably something like $50-100, I guess?), which would probably be money that comes from the (upcoming) Patreon, or perhaps from a sponsor if we found one.\n\nInterest?
