Hi all!<br/>I’m Emil, from Vienna<br/>Just read about your recent meetup on Twitter<br/><br/>I’ve been experimenting with tools for thought since ~2015, building a personal CRM which turned out to be a note taking app with daily pages and bidirectional linking, something we know from other apps too nowadays.<br/>Since recognising that what I built can be used for various things, I became interested in building modular software—environments that can be shaped by their users.<br/><br/>The member handbook says I might share a blog article in my intro. I think this one might be interesting to some of you: <a href="https://emilbruckner.substack.com/p/47-formable-mobile-app">https://emilbruckner.substack.com/p/47-formable-mobile-app</a>.  It talks about how users could create their own mobile experiences on desktop.
