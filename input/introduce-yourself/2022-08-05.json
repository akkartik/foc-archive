Or to put it another way, a tool for creating, storing, and following complex human workflows \/ routines \/ processes. I recently put out <https:\/\/a.methodable.com\/guide\/e0412eb2-36fd-4903-b186-d2de931fefc7|an extensive interactive guide> (which is itself a human program, of course) about how to use Methodable and the theory behind it.\n\nI’m interested in question like:\n• How can non-technical people use programming to improve their lives?\n• How can we create fluid programmability without written syntax? How far do visual interfaces get us?\n• What things are people good at and what things are computers good at and how can we create programs that employ the strengths of both human and computer?\nI’m currently in San Francisco, and would be stoked to meet anyone out here! Or to meet people online, anyways, just excited to be here and see what you all are up to! :smiley:",
