Clarification: the metaphor of a war isn't intended to emphasize hostility. The key characteristic I'm trying to point out is that allies in a war often <em>want different things</em>. Whereas workers in a factory used to have so few degrees of freedom that they could be considered aligned for all practical purposes, the relationship between software vendors and their users offers so many more degrees of freedom that "let me pay you to build this for me" starts seeming naive and clueless.<br/><br/>I believe when we started giving software away for free, we released a genie out of a bottle that is never going back in. And arguably it shouldn't; FOSS has given us many boons. But it requires a fundamentally different way to think about things. In a world where your money is no good, you need to find other ways to organize.<br/><br/>Ok, I'll shut up now :confused:
