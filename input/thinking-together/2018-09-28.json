That sucks. It'd be awfully nice to be able to represent free-form changes at the same semantic level as constructive\/procedural changes. I'm sure that's been done, I just don't think it's filtered up to the level of 3d art tools.",

That sucks. It'd be awfully nice to be able to represent free-form changes at the same semantic level as constructive\/procedural changes. I'm sure that's been done, I just don't think it's filtered up to the level of 3d art tools."
