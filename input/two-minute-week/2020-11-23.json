I will probably eventually support Midi devices and external synthesizers such as Super Collider, but I wanted something that just works out of the box, and can be easily hacked\/tweaked.  One of my goals is that a developer can take this tool and do any kind of A\/V research they want.  Perhaps they want to try a new sound effect, or a new way to visualize sound, or work on a new music language.  This should give them a great starting point.",
