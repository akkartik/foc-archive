        "text": "Text as a storage representation is indeed universal in a sense that text-based tools work with all data that's text based. Git works the same whether you work with Python source code, tex-files, or any other text-based data. A universal representation is important because it enables compatibility across tools and also means that users need less tools to achieve their goals. Just imagine you'd have to learn a new version control system and editor each time you start using another programming language.\nOn the other hand, we're often dealing with complex structures that don't map to text well. Programs (in all languages I know) are a nested tree structure and a lot of complexity is caused by having to re-create this structure from primitive text. In VPL, a natural representation would probably be some kind of graph structure and I suspect that encoding this into a textual representation would be possible, but not really usable.\nSo what if we could have a structured (tree\/graph-based) universal representation? People could write general-purpose editors \/ version control systems \/ ... and a lot of issues related to parsing \/ serialisation would become a lot easier since the structure of the domain would map to the storage representation more naturally.\nA lot of people seem to think that there's no alternative to text that's as flexible and universally usable. I instead see a lot of issues with text (parsing, encoding of presentation \/ code style \/ line limits, data types, efficiency, accuracy of diffs, ...) that could possibly be resolved by switching to more expressive hierarchical \/ node-based formats. A \"universal\" format is important, but that doesn't mean that it has to be a primitive stream of characters.\n_Thanks for reading until the end. This topic probably deserves a blog post..._",

                                "text": "Text as a storage representation is indeed universal in a sense that text-based tools work with all data that's text based. Git works the same whether you work with Python source code, tex-files, or any other text-based data. A universal representation is important because it enables compatibility across tools and also means that users need less tools to achieve their goals. Just imagine you'd have to learn a new version control system and editor each time you start using another programming language.\nOn the other hand, we're often dealing with complex structures that don't map to text well. Programs (in all languages I know) are a nested tree structure and a lot of complexity is caused by having to re-create this structure from primitive text. In VPL, a natural representation would probably be some kind of graph structure and I suspect that encoding this into a textual representation would be possible, but not really usable.\nSo what if we could have a structured (tree\/graph-based) universal representation? People could write general-purpose editors \/ version control systems \/ ... and a lot of issues related to parsing \/ serialisation would become a lot easier since the structure of the domain would map to the storage representation more naturally.\nA lot of people seem to think that there's no alternative to text that's as flexible and universally usable. I instead see a lot of issues with text (parsing, encoding of presentation \/ code style \/ line limits, data types, efficiency, accuracy of diffs, ...) that could possibly be resolved by switching to more expressive hierarchical \/ node-based formats. A \"universal\" format is important, but that doesn't mean that it has to be a primitive stream of characters.\n"
