<pre style="white-space:pre-wrap"> My good friends in the Smalltalk community effectively ignored both Strongtalk and Newspeak. <br/>It required commitment and a willingness to go outside their comfort zone.<br/><br/>I believe, the community has been self-selected to consist of those who are not bothered by Smalltalk's <br/>initial limitations, and so are unmotivated to address them or support those who do. In fact, they often <br/>could not even see these limitations staring them in the face, causing them to adopt unrealistic <br/>business policies that hurt them more than anyone else.<br/><br/>Perhaps an even deeper problem with Smalltalk is that it attracts people who are a tad too creative and <br/>imaginative; organizing them into a cohesive movement is like herding cats.</pre>

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span> That’s what the second commenter says too. I hadn’t heard about <em>The Lisp Curse</em> before and can only recommend reading it right after: <a href="http://winestockwebdesign.com/Essays/Lisp_Curse.html">http://winestockwebdesign.com/Essays/Lisp_Curse.html</a><br/><br/>I find the message of <em>The Lisp Curse</em> mich more useful then the slightly whiny article about Smalltalk. I had never looked at what comes with the power of being able to fit the whole programming system into your head — when you alone can do anything, there’s no need for collaboration. But to build something that is appreciated by many, you need the diversity of a team.

That second commenter is me :smiley:<br/><br/>There is one aspect missing in the Lisp Curse, and also its Smalltalk variant: both languages predate the Internet. Before the internet, collaboration was difficult to establish. Both finding collaborators and interacting with them was much more difficult than it is today. I suspect that this is why Clojure escaped the Lisp Curse, in spite of sharing all the features that were supposed to encourage it in Common Lisp.

People propose new languages all the time. The arguments in favor of the new languages often revolve around increased expressive power, or conciseness, or new buzzwords. But to businesses and government entities which provide most of the employment in the field, their overriding concern is for stability, and transferability. Time and time again, the industry consensus has been to select the worst, most verbose language available, that had the perception of being easy to understand. LISP, which permits, some would say encourages, very sneaky metalinguistic abstraction practices, is well known to be  "write-only" language, so regardless of its positive attributes has been shunned for 50 years (and probably rightly so). Python has crept up into the top 3 due to merit; it is reasonably compact, and reasonably easy to read.<br/><br/>I used Modula-2 which was the 10 year later sequel to Pascal. It was superior to C in every single aspect except popularity. It generates faster, smaller more compact, more readable programs, and its feature set has 100% correspondence with C, and adds dozens of error-reducing compile-time and runtime checks against dumb errors like nil pointers, array bounds checks, and conversion errors. I could not get a single person to convert to Modula-2 in 20 years because everyone was in thrall to Microsoft's dominance. Whatever MS did was the law, and people were afraid to buck the behemoth's practices. Now i look back and see the probably close to 100,000 security patches that have had to be applied to MS's code base, all because stupid C doesn't have NIL pointer or runtime range checks. The amount of wasted time spend downloading and installing these patches, none of which would have been necessary had MS used a more robust language.<br/><br/>And let's not forget that the people working as programmers many of which are paid by the hour, have a perverse incentive to use the most troublesome language available. Programming is one of the few fields where people are paid full wages to fix their own errors. A building contractor, when he screws up, often has to pay with free labor to fix their mistakes, while programmers typically earn 75%+ of their total income from fixing their own mistakes. Not a pretty picture that one.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@magicmouse94937</span> You are the first person I hear mentioning Modula 2 in many decades. I used Modula 2 as my main language on the Atari ST eons ago, then switched to C because the people I worked with insisted on using C because everybody uses C.

But just todo away with it like that is too easy. I do think its also a crisis of computer science and more largely science culture at large! It almost seems like the body of knowledge became so large that it collapsed under its own weight and since then. I first "got" a sense for that when reading dijkstras diaries and when he talks about scalability issues with teachers at universities but also the apparent problems of conveying "radical new" concepts.

Now going back to gilads post you can see how Elements from a specific computing culture (smalltalk) had their interacting with society.  Of course these where complex interactions but I think the business model thing is a nice example of a structure and function thing. Open Source is a structure to serve a function from society. I think it exemplifies the strange but important relationship between technology and people. We created institutions like computer science or computer industry but it is very difficult to interact with them. The sheer distance from paying taxes to a published research paper to working piece of software using ideas from research is simply too vast.

Imagine someone writing something like "structure of scientific revolutions" but different from a computer science perspective. I would see gilads post at least as a formidable introduction for a chapter. We need way more meta reasoning about what structures and functions we currently have and then we actually want to have.
