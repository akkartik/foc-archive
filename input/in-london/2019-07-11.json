After programming german card games for over ten years I'm now working on making computational research explorable at <http:\/\/nextjournal.com|nextjournal.com>. Bret Victor has been a big influence for the project, especially his climate change article. After never even looking at a LISP because of a distaste for it's parens we've finally discovered and learnt to love Clojure and we're now using it across the whole stack. I'll also be at Papers We Love in London on sunday and Curry On next week. Please say hello if you're also around!",
