In the hard sciences, if you do an experiment that proves some great new theory, it isn't accepted on its face. It has be replicated in at least one other lab in order to be accepted, otherwise it might have been a fluke. There is that funny joke journal of irreproducible results. Anyway we should consider starting to look at code with a real critical eye, and ask if another person could modify or improve (or at least understand) how a program works, and start ranking things for their readability/complexity/understandability. I once had access to the UNIX source code, back when it was a licensed thing and under NDA, and the code that did the FTP transfers was so clever with really gnarly computations about how to maximize throughput. No chance of improving that without breaking it for a normal mortal. And there aren't even 100 people on earth who understand the TrueType language used to generate all the typeface renderings. I would venture to say that the text entry field code in any operating systems you care to mention is at least a million lines total. The second you ask for text entry, with typography, you are entering a vast land of complexity, and really that is the core of what OS'es give you, is text handling.
