                "text": "The Fifth Generation Computer Systems (FGCS) was an initiative by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), begun in 1982, to create computers using massively parallel computing and logic programming. It was to be the result of a massive government\/industry research project in Japan during the 1980s. It aimed to create an \"epoch-making computer\" with supercomputer-like performance and to provide a platform for future developments in artificial intelligence. There was also an unrelated Russian project also named as a fifth-generation computer (see Kronos (computer)).\n\nProf. Ehud Shapiro, in his \"Trip Report\" paper (which focused the FGCS project on concurrent logic programming as the software foundation for the project), captured the rationale and motivations driving this huge project: \"As part of Japan's effort to become a leader in the computer industry, the Institute for New Generation Computer Technology has launched a revolutionary ten-year plan for the development of large computer systems which will be applicable to knowledge information processing systems. These Fifth Generation computers will be built around the concepts of logic programming. In order to refute the accusation that Japan exploits knowledge from abroad without contributing any of its own, this project will stimulate original research and will make its results available to the international research community.\"\nThe term \"fifth generation\" was intended to convey the system as being a leap beyond existing machines. In the history of computing hardware, computers using vacuum tubes were called the first generation; transistors and diodes, the second; integrated circuits, the third; and those using microprocessors, the fourth. Whereas previous computer generations had focused on increasing the number of logic elements in a single CPU, the fifth generation, it was widely believed at the time, would instead turn to massive numbers of CPUs for added performance.\nThe project was to create the computer over a ten-year period, after which it was considered ended and investment in a new \"sixth generation\" project would begin. Opinions about its outcome are divided: either it was a failure, or it was ahead of its time.",

            "text": "Just a random thought: I was looking at Bret Victor’s old Learnable Programming, and it had a little note about how programming consists of decomposing problems, and I realized: that’s not what I do these days. I spend all my time thinking about messaging and communication between systems, and “decomposition” feels like a luxury. I don’t know if that’s a general change in programming, or just the nature of my work or professional stage… but it feels like a real change to me.\n\nThat is, I spend a lot of time thinking about these things:\n1. What are the entities in my system? These could be as simple as objects, but might be remote services, or different processes, browser tabs, etc.\n2. Who knows what?\n3. Who needs to keep track of what?\n4. From any given context, how do I get access to the other entities?\n5. How do I communicate with them? The push\/pull of functions or RPC? Pub\/sub? Some wonky event system?\n6. Where does a particular change originate, and which entities are simply reactive?\n\nThis all is where a lot of modern language development leaves me cold. Types don’t offer much here. Going further, I think there really is a kind of modernist\/postmodernist break here (ala <http:\/\/homepages.mcs.vuw.ac.nz\/~kjx\/papers\/nopp.pdf>): modern approaches attempt to create self-consistent and robust systems, and postmodernist approaches accept that we operate in a diverse systems where a lot of important things happen at the intersection of incompatible modernist systems.\n\nI don’t have any conclusion in mind, but I’d be interested in people’s thoughts.",

I spend all my time thinking about messaging and communication between systems, and “decomposition” feels like a luxury. I don’t know if that’s a general change in programming, or just the nature of my work or professional stage… but it feels like a real change to me.\n\nThat is, I spend a lot of time thinking about these things:\n1. What are the entities in my system? These could be as simple as objects, but might be remote services, or different processes, browser tabs, etc.\n2. Who knows what?\n3. Who needs to keep track of what?\n4. From any given context, how do I get access to the other entities?\n5. How do I communicate with them? The push\/pull of functions or RPC? Pub\/sub? Some wonky event system?\n6. Where does a particular change originate, and which entities are simply reactive?\n\nThis all is where a lot of modern language development leaves me cold. Types don’t offer much here. Going further, I think there really is a kind of modernist\/postmodernist break here (ala "
