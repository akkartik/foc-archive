Yes! In my opinion development environments could be a lot more like Roam Research and the like: We have functions, each function references other functions and is referenced by other functions, thus shaping a graph of functions. So why not make this graph the structure of the environment, rather than some more or less arbitrary folders and files.

For me the future of programming is about making it simpler for everyone, especially people without technology backgrounds, to take advantage of computation and the powerful devices we carry around with us all the time.<br/><br/>I consider a tool for thought something that literally helps us think. Not attempting to do the thinking for us, or automate away thinking, but augmenting and enhancing our capabilities to understand, ideate, and explore. We stay in control, and our cognitive abilities are amplified.<br/><br/>After all, people who use tools like Roam Research are “just” modeling certain parts of their individual thinking process and the tool gives them an environment to structure their thoughts in, which is remarkably similar to designing a data model, except that it requires much more flexibility and dynamism than what we computer people think of when we talk about a “data model”.<br/><br/>From that perspective the overlap is huge. I do acknowledge, however, that this is just a narrow definition of both tools for thought and the future of programming, and there are plenty of other areas to explore in both.

I don't know the Tools for Thoughts movement very well, but I guess that it can help improve programming activities which are still too often limited to raw text code editing, even if you can write some specification doc, with design and system architecture represented visually, etc. But as programming activity is - hmm - a thought process, it has to be improvable with better tools for thoughts.<br/><br/>So one can dream of a programming environment that provides tools for the "thinking" of the programming artifacts that are being created, and the way the thoughts are recorded/shown to be deeply connected to the actual programming artifacts.<br/><br/>I mean, when we start a new relatively complex project, we often start by discussing and thinking by drawing sketches on a whiteboard. Then we move to our computer writing code to bring the architecture/design to life. But the connection between the "thoughts artifacts" and the system is lost. Why not having tools that help us keep the too connected?

Is there a Tools for Thought community (slack, discord, etc.)? Seems a little more broadly spread out between different app communities like Roam etc.<br/><br/>The overlap is as pointed out substantial, but the approach of either side look like they start from different philosophies. Projects that show up in Future of Coding seem to emphasize tangible experimentation with the <em>process</em> of engineering, often from a bottom-up approach (i.e. what are the small composable pieces and the processes that construct them). On the other hand, Zettelkasten systems and other such approaches are more top-down, in the style of trying to understand or create a specification, and in general maneuvering in graph-like space of ideas rather than lower-level processes with causal chains.<br/><br/>Meeting in the middle is the natural next step, but I wonder where the emphasis should be placed. Are we missing an interface between thought and implementation, due to the tremendous difficulty of translation as pointed out by many already? Are the two sides not melded enough, or instead are they not well-separated enough? Is there a missing calculus of thought somewhere floating in this space? Would love to explore these areas with anyone interested, or hear about any other interesting endeavors along these lines.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Christopher Galtenberg</span> I feel personally attacked. :D<br/><br/>But seriously, I agree the intersection is very large. To me, they're both fundamentally about representing (and manipulating) ideas in digital form. I've been thinking about them as different aspects of the same problem for a while now.

I find it hard to take note-taking apps seriously in isolation of the features of a computational notebook (e.g. Mathematica, &amp;c). I like to keep interlinked notecards about my research, but I also require the ability to write and run code that analyzes and visualizes data, performs simulations, and so on, in the same environment. The affordances I prefer in this context are not different from the ones I prefer when building larger pieces of software, so it does ultimately feel like all one thing from my perspective...

More context: I see that Tools of Thought are mainly about adding self contained snippets of knowledge and linking them without a particular schema/taxonomy (input), the value you get out of it are the "insights" through navigation and finding patterns or relationships over time when you go back to some node and navigate adjacent ones (output). I would call these as <b>Navigational/Organizational Tools of Thought.</b><br/><br/>On the Future of Coding side if we tried to relate it I would call it <b>Computational Tools of Thought</b> where your inputs are both data (more structured, less textual) but also some computation instructions that operate on data, the "insights" you get out are the results of computations or the ability to tinker with the data and computation to better understand the underlying model.<br/><br/>The inputs (in my definition) are different, on Navigational Tools of Thought they are mostly hypertext created by humans and made for human consumption, in Computational Tools of Thought inputs are more structured, created by humans or computers and made to be processed, at the end they can be converted to a human format for interpretation or interpreted directly if they are human-friendly (a table, a number or similar)<br/><br/>Does it make sense? :slightly_smiling_face:

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jack Rusher</span> Do you have a post or screencast about it by any chance? I'd particularly love to see a list of what you consider to be the key properties/mechanisms of such a system.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> I have had "make a video about Tiro" on my TODO list for quite some years now, but haven't even written any blog posts. OTOH, I've been gradually porting parts of it from my personal Scheme dialect to Clojure with an eye toward open sourcing the bits that make sense...

I feel they are very close and I think I see the same people moving between them. Or at least my corner of them.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen it yet, my own "tool for thought" is also aiming to be a light coding notebook : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_THeK9EBw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_THeK9EBw</a><br/><br/>And I have a couple of other experiments I'm working on, that I'm not quite ready to talk about yet, but which I hope will be interesting to future coders and will be integrated into Cardigan Bay soon.
