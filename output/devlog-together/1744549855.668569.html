Keep getting sidetracked by making little Lua libraries. This one implements Python-style f-strings in Lua. Pretty cool to have a language that lets you go this far with its syntax. With just a little bit of work this could be extended to implement <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/">Python's template strings (PEP 750)</a> and then we could use Lua to make all sorts of DSLs. My initial motivation was easier printf debugging, though :sweat_smile:.<br/><br/>I started working on this on an iPad with the Codea app, of all things. Was fun, but sadly I couldn't use any of the Bret Victor-inspired things they had in it since I wasn't using any of the app-specific libraries they had.<br/><br/>Though putting aside the library, I think at this point the most interesting thing I did is actually making it possible to use it right on my website without having to install or download anything.<br/><br/><a href="https://ezhik.jp/f-string.lua/">https://ezhik.jp/f-string.lua/</a>
