This means that any container can be scripted, for examle a 'pictures' folder can be built to show either a grid view or a slideshow of  images it contains, or an UI to switch between both, and the images inside can be images stored on disk or links to images on the network, and the folder doesn't need to care.\n\nThe system has been up and running as my website for a while now, running either server side (static html output) or clientside (live DOM output) but with no ability to edit content. For my Bachelor Work I am now planning to add editing capabilities in the front-end, that should also be scriptable similar to how the output has been scriptable so far - the idea being that this would enable the creation of e.g. a document\/folder behaving like an MS Word document, containing images, videos and text, but being editable in page layout; or for example a pinwall\/moodboard for arranging snippets on a pannable canvas etc.\n\nIf anyone is interested to see some examples, the website is <https:\/\/s-ol.nu> and comes with a little inspector to look at the system contents. The code for everything is also public here: <https:\/\/git.s-ol.nu\/mmm\/>\n\n*If this rings any bells with anyone, it would be very helpful if you could point me to any theory that I could relate to in my thesis.* Thanks!",
