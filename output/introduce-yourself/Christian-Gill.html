Hi folks :wave: been lurking for a bit but never introduced myself.<br/><br/>I'm from Argentina :mate_drink: living in The Netherlands :cheese_wedge: <br/><br/>At work I do mostly frontend, although been moving to full stack slowly. It was React for around 5 years and now with Elm and Haskell.<br/><br/>I'm curious about how AI will impact programming and Software Engineering. Here are some notes on the topic <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/gillchristian/Notes/How+will+AI+impact+Software+Engineering%3F">https://publish.obsidian.md/gillchristian/Notes/How+will+AI+&hellip;</a> (digital garden style, just a draft)<br/><br/>Also, a while ago I did a PoC of a <em>search by type signature</em> app for TypeScript (like Haskell's Hoogle). But I faced some challenges and never continued. I want to pick up the project again :tm:  if you have any literature on the matter it would ge really valuable (like static analysis to extract type information and search indexes data structures). Here are some random notes on the project <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/gillchristian/Notes/Thoughts+on+Tsearch">https://publish.obsidian.md/gillchristian/Notes/Thoughts+on+Tsearch</a> The project is running on <a href="http://tsearch.io">tsearch.io</a> but the search doesn't actually work
