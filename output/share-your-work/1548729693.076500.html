I am submitting a paper to SNAPL 2019 (<a href="https://snapl.org/2019/">https://snapl.org/2019/</a>) about the design of the PL course I taught at Stanford. My goal is for readers to come away understanding the rationale for how I designed the course, why I believe that it’s a good idea, and that the initial trials have been successful. Would love to get feedback on anything that is unclear or unjustified.

I was interested to see how you measured success. I would like to have seen:<br/>- comparison against alternative courses<br/>- measurements other than student feedback<br/><br/>I suspect a charming lecturer will score highly irrespective of the course content!<br/><br/>I like the motivation but as someone from industry not academia, I would want you to go much further! It sounds like the assignments are all greenfield work. I'd like a PL design course to give students a 1M LOC dump of code and some rearchitecting goals. Can they understand the code and successfully refactor it?<br/><br/>From a PL design point of view, it's the real test of a language and it's type system that I care about in practice and as an employer, it's the real-world skill I want students to learn.<br/><br/>I am horrified by the waste we have in industry due to "legacy code" and rewrites which I fear is more about our difficulty to grok and maintain large code-bases than anything else.

Thanks for the feedback! Alas yes, this was not a scientific comparison, as there are few meaningful quantitative measurements of course quality. The point of this essay is moreso to discuss the curriculum than to make a sound claim about the outcomes.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Woods</span> it would be interesting to know what kind of refactoring tasks you consider most challenging. I’ve considered such assignments in the past, but I haven’t been able to find the right balance of challenging, meaningful, and doable in a week.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Will Crichton</span><br/><br/>Oooh - good question!<br/><br/>It's quite project specific about what would work. I think I would collaborate with project maintainer to look over the history of a real codebase for a suitable bug/feature that has been already been completed so you can assess the actual changes required.<br/><br/>It may not be a good assignment on an open source project if the answer is just sat there on GitHub! Might need to find an old deprecated project that isn't so accessible anymore. Anything on sourceforge lol.<br/><br/>A better idea might be collaborating with a local company who has a suitable project. Good opportunity for the company to learn something too.

The only concern I have with this approach is that while this is certainly sensible for a software engineering class, a programming language theory class has different requirements. Such an assignment would need to not just show how to solve bugs in the real world, but to demonstrate how specific features of programming languages (and ideally type systems) are uniquely useful in making the refactoring process more productive.

(This is, generally speaking, the biggest point that I think most functional programming education misses---FP matters a lot in the real world b/c a rich type system make collaboration possible, but this point is difficult to make in the context of small, bite-sized assignments.)

Yep. The idea of separating "software engineering" and "programming language design" as different subjects is kind of horrifying. Design has to be informed by studying use exactly as you are doing.<br/><br/>I don't think a lot of the claims about programming language features e.g. advanced type systems and purity are evidence based. I think we need to rebrand PL design away from theory and mathematics to something pragmatic based on data from observations e.g. call it "PL Engineering".<br/><br/>Size of project is definitely a factor for understanding language features. You just don't face problems that matter in primitive languages on toy projects. There is a hierarchy of comfort something like:<br/><br/><tt>    100 LOC</tt> - asm<br/><tt>   1000 LOC</tt> - dynamic types<br/><tt>  10000 LOC</tt> - static types<br/><tt> 100000 LOC</tt> - modules<br/><tt>1000000 LOC</tt> - package managers<br/><br/>I won't experience much pain writing up to 1000 lines of a dynamically typed language but I'd refuse to write 100k+ lines without static types, generics, lambdas, refactoring tools, profilers and static analysis tools etc.

An idea for an exercise that might be fun:<br/>- have a 3 hour work shop to build a little game<br/>- everyone starts on their own machine<br/>- every 15 minutes, a whistle blows and they have to get up and move to the machine on their left and continue building the game based on their neighbour's progress<br/>- everyone reviews the history of each project to work out why some projects proceeded faster than others<br/><br/>Might learn a little bit about language design and readability / safety but more about engineering practices. I think students would quickly invent a lot of strategies for how to leave incomplete work e.g. inline documentation about what they were aiming to achieve.

Congrats, Will! I'm envious of your students. Seems like a really well thought out class. I find it hard to believe that you can cover all that in a semester!
