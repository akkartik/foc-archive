I search for Sourcegraph vs IDEs, there's one about vs IntelliJ from stackshare. In that Intelli-j trounces sourcegraph (it's a popularity contest though)\n\nThe idea of write once use everywhere is appealing to the engineer in me but I only use a couple of editors in every day use.\n\nThey really need a \"why sourcegraph is better than your IDE\" page with concrete examples of where sourcegraph did something I actually need to do. When I was on the chromium team their code search (<https:\/\/cs.chromium.org\/>) was super useful but I'm not working on anything that big at the moment.\n\nSo, \"why sourcegraph is better than my IDE?\"\n\nand, for the browser plugin, what are some concrete examples of things I would actually do with it?",

I don't remember where or why I switched from sceptical to interest peaked but I did. BUT.....\n\nThen I went to spread the love. I go paste links to their site and their chrome extension in another slack. I'm met with the same scepticism and I have zero ideas about how to convey anything that would get the other devs to even look. I go on the Sourcegraph site, nothing. I search for Sourcegraph vs IDEs, there's one about vs IntelliJ from stackshare. In that Intelli-j trounces sourcegraph (it's a popularity contest though)\n\nThe idea of write once use everywhere is appealing to the engineer in me but I only use a couple of editors in every day use.\n\nThey really need a \"why sourcegraph is better than your IDE\" page with concrete examples of where sourcegraph did something I actually need to do. When I was on the chromium team their code search ("
                            },
                            {
                                "type": "link",
                                "url": "https:\/\/cs.chromium.org\/"
                            },
                            {
                                "type": "text",
                                "text": ") was super useful but I'm not working on anything that big at the moment.\n\nSo, \"why sourcegraph is better than my IDE?\"\n\nand, for the browser plugin, what are some concrete examples of things I would actually do with it?"
