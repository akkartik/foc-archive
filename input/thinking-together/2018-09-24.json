        "text": "<@UCQ4BBFQ9> sorry to hear about this struggle from you and others. My thoughts are closely aligned with <@UA14TGLTC>'s comment above - connection with people is important and also 'labour in service of a worthy end'. I don't have experience in academia, but I do think in the industry there's a wide range of technologies, cultures and environments. It's possible that even with the current state of programming, a software based job can be a positive experience. It might help to start by identifying your strong preferences, e.g. the technologies\/languages, scope of problem, level of autonomy, etc. you'd want to keep you engaged. I feel the actual field (e.g. programming tools vs making apps) is less important. E.g. if you don't agree with the basic design choices and you don't have autonomy over them, a 'programming tool' may not be that much fun.",

I don't have experience in academia, but I do think in the industry there's a wide range of technologies, cultures and environments. It's possible that even with the current state of programming, a software based job can be a positive experience. It might help to start by identifying your strong preferences, e.g. the technologies\/languages, scope of problem, level of autonomy, etc. you'd want to keep you engaged. I feel the actual field (e.g. programming tools vs making apps) is less important. E.g. if you don't agree with the basic design choices and you don't have autonomy over them, a 'programming tool' may not be that much fun."
