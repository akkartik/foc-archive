I also tried to reimplement tixy.land! Using my own adacraft tool (in that case nearly no special adacraft features has been used, so one can do the same with Scratch). See -> <a href="https://adacraft.org/project/281257812260028929">https://adacraft.org/project/281257812260028929</a><br/><br/>Not sure it has the same spirit as tixy.land though. Because the original idea is to implement the algorithm with a simple formula as a text expression in less than 32 characters, and in my project the formula is programmed with blocks with no limit. But, hey, it was fun to do it!<br/><br/>And with this project I also wanted to explore how to organize and document block programming code Ã  la Scratch to make it more expressive.
