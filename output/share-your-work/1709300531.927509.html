Inspired by the <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/061.html">Programming as Theory Building</a> episode we are building a tool to help development teams capture &amp; store the theory of their program text.<br/>We achieve this through auto-generation of logical paths through the codebase which developers explain to each-other through voice and video.<br/><br/>We would love to hear the thoughts of this community specifically as many of you will see what we are trying to achieve here.<br/>Checkout out our <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/KWX-ten-dev-understand-code-remarkably-fast">launch</a> for more info.

This is interesting. I just kickstarted a conversation about this internally at my work, so thanks for putting this on my radar!<br/><br/>I'm curious how you see your work in relation to version control. Which one subsumes the other, or how do they play together?

Amazing! I will definitely add a link to the pod on the website :grin: <br/><br/>Currently on a code push to the main branch we identify the branch/path which has been affected by the push and identify that branch as potentially requiring more context. <br/><br/>There’s a lot more we can do with version control such as tagging branch states to commits and we’re always looking for angles.

Yeah, I really like the idea. One my  long term goals in my editor is to have something like this. Focused a bit more asynchronously. But I love the focus on the code as the grounds for the conversation. It is so hard to do that today with so few tools to help.<br/><br/>Have you seen this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSqLt8BgbRQ">strangeloop talk</a> on using tests to find interesting subsets of the system? Seems quite a bit in line with what you are doing.<br/><br/>I've got to ask, was the direction of inspiration here truly from the episode to the tool? If that's awesome. If not, nice tie in :slightly_smiling_face:

Yes! That’s where our idea for slices came from :grin: funny that you made that same connection.<br/><br/>We had been looking at the space for a little while but didn’t quite know how to name or categorise what we wanted to build. <br/><br/>The Naur paper and episode were crucial to give us the clarity of thought and framework to start building in this particular direction.
