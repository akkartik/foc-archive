I’ve been trying to figure out better ways to visualize and classify functions that are M x M -> M (potentially monadic)<br/>Specifically there are properties/relationships I’d love to be able to “see” such as disjointness, symmetries (group? communative?), associativity, triangle inequalities (cartesian?), identity element, equivalences, and “primes” (all m in M such that M is only a result with itself and identity).<br/>Only thing I’ve found in general so far are MxM tables, which are rather opaque for some of these properties.<br/>Anyone seen any specific visualizations, families of visualizations, or property “classifiers” (for finite cases) like this? I was thinking something like 3 “circles” of points in M--the result “sandwiched” between the args-- might be revealing.
