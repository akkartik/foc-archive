<b>What brought me to the future of programming space ...</b><br/><br/>Hi, I am Lukas M Süss (aka mechadense)<br/><br/>I guess for me my path to "future of coding" relevant topics was initially kicked off many years ago (2005 maybe?) when stumbling across a german website with name "C-hater in 10 days".<br/>Before I already had banged my head into the limitations of current day programing languages again and again.<br/>• First in the context of game programming, <br/>• and later in the context of 3D modelling.<br/><b>That was revelation one.</b><br/><em>Here the (german) page in the internetarchive:</em> <br/><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080612103719/http://www.math.uni-bremen.de:80/~thielema/CHater.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20080612103719/http://www.math.u&hellip;</a> )</em> <br/><br/>This eventually led me to taking a course about the haskell programming language and the theory behind it. What I learnd there was quite eye opening and <b>my second revelation.</b><br/>_The (german) course: <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/knoop/fp185A03_ws2122.html">http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/knoop/fp185A03_ws2122.html</a> — by Jens Knoop — at TU Vienna_<br/><br/>At some point when I came across diagramming sofware (then I used yEd) I sketched out all of what I've learned so far. Thereby realizing …<br/>• (A) … how far even Haskell is still improvable. — <b>Revelation three.</b><br/>• (B) … how much can be learned by high level diagramming and how awesome it would be if that would fall out of a programming language<br/>I was starting to desire autopropagarion of renaiming, automatic code substitutions, and more … Desiring structured editing — basically.<br/><br/>My <b>fourth revelation</b> was making the connection between John Tromps Lambda diagrams and textual code, leading to my work on "Annotated Lambda Diagrams (ALDs)".<br/>-- _<a href="http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram">http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram</a>_<br/>I found that translating existing ideas into these diagrams greatly helps me in understanding them. Which makes me think that this may be a good "semitextual" programming interface.<br/>Now I'm in the process of investigating ideas-and-work of some great people in the context of ALDs ( Looking at ideas from: Conal Elliott, Jonathan Edwards, Cryus Omar <a href="http://et.al">et.al</a>. , Daniel P. Friedman, ... ) All this as spare time efforts.<br/><br/>My <b>fifth and so far final revelation</b> (during 2018) emergerd probably mostly from my frustration with nonexistence …<br/>• … of local-first selfhosting options.<br/>• … of personal local-first self-owned content curation assistents.<br/>I realized that in order for good novel technical solutions of core problems to thrive sociotechnical problems need to be solved in unison <em>(unison the word not unison the proglang here)</em>. Code just cannot be borderlessly shared if there are no well designed means that allow for judement of its trustworthyness.<br/>What I want to see eventually are distributed ledgers that:<br/>• do not insist on maximally global public consensus for everything and <br/>• are nonmonetary at their core.<br/>Very few projects aim for that. In fact I only know one so far.<br/><br/>— — —<br/><br/><b>Regarding the "future of coding" side of my interests I'm into:</b> <br/>• denotative core language design<br/>• content adressed design (datastorage and versioning)<br/>• dependent typing <br/>• agent centric design (sociotechnical aspect)<br/>• and what I missed here ...<br/>My core interest though is actually advanced atomically precise manufacturing (APM). Aimed at future gemstome-metamaterial-on-chip-factories. But if software does not get fixed I see a dark future ahead. Both for the path there and the eventual result.

No … Well … I see the unison programming language as one of the most promising (if not THE most promising in it's core idea) approach on the non-social technical side.<br/>~~~<br/>What I'am eying on the sociotechnical side (and what I was referring to)  is something like holochain.<br/>I think that holochain or something similar needs to be developed in unison (unison the word not unison the language) with good technical solutions including the ideas of unison (unison the language not the word). –– <em>Sorry this got confusing.</em><br/>~~~<br/>If something like holochain would eventually somewhen be developed in unison (the language) that would be terrific. But that's decades away.<br/>~~~<br/>The other way around: Running unison code (or similar) on holochain (or similar) is also interesting, likely also quite far into the future, but still might happen sooner.

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Lukas Süss</span> , I find it surprising and even pleasantly that you seem to have similar  views which kind of components are evolving. There a are a lot of things going on on the "sociotechnical" side I'm leaning towards what <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Sophie Smithburg</span> had written here sofar about collaboration/cooperation and the values or relationships involved. I really like the notion of "tool for conviviality" here.<br/>There is also RChain which is more or less Greg Meredith's project, Rho lang and Rho-Calculus have some interesting properties but are missing some others...<br/>Also there are interesting things happening in the Ethereum related Ecosystem, For example the experiments around DAO's from Gnosis Guild. They did something called radicle orgs together with radicle: <a href="https://radicle.xyz/blog/radicle-orgs.html">https://radicle.xyz/blog/radicle-orgs.html</a> . I have a feeling that DAOs or a related concept with another name will play a big part in the picture we are aiming for. Kei Kreutler wrote this interesting piece on the relationship between Cooperatives, gaming guilds and DAOs: Cooperatives: <a href="https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1417861127590092802">https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1417861127590092802</a> . Kei is giving a workshop on DAOs with zodiac over at the kernel 0x course: <a href="https://kernel.community/en/">https://kernel.community/en/</a> in the first session there was already some interesting discussion on the issues of trust.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andreas S.</span><br/>I've read about radicle as a project aiming at a<br/>decentralizedly governed alternative to Microsoft github. This got me quite excited. But looking into it (I actually tried it out quite a while ago) I found that this still has ways to go for being a well usable alternative. I was not (or no longer?) aware of the relation between radicle and Gnosis Guild.<br/><br/>I had a look at pi-calculus once. Seems rho-calculus builds onto that ... No clue about RChain though - might wanna look into that somewhen.<br/><br/>What I'd like to see being built (and what I mostly was referring to with "sociotechnical") is fundamental core protocols for rule-carrying tamper-proof virtual distibuted "graph-database-like-filesystems" that at core are non-monetary and that can store large amounts of data (including video and such). Holochains distributed hash tables e.g. seem to promise that. Or something equivalent from an other project that too is not insisting on glogal consensus for everything. As of yet I don't know any such projects though  …<br/><br/>Without such protocols soon enough in place, when it comes to great projects on the futureOfCoding-technical side, like e.g. the unison programming language, I see issues coming up with spamming, malware, and the like.<br/>( Especially once closed source SW gets supported and allowed in. Which is a when not a whether. )<br/>The result being that artificial sandboxing "solutions" will need to be errected (again).<br/>And the necessity to (legitimately) get though these ad-hoc errected emergency walls may well introduce soul-crushing code-plumbing yet again.<br/>And that despite the situation that the language finally would actually be technically capable to allow for averting all these horrible code-plumbing efforts.<br/>As the vision goes: <a href="https://pchiusano.github.io/2013-05-22/future-of-software.html">https://pchiusano.github.io/2013-05-22/future-of-software.html</a>
