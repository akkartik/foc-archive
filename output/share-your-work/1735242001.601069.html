Bonus episode alert!<br/><br/><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/118714678">FUTURE OF CODING: INTERVIEW</a><br/><br/>(featuring <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Philippa Markovics</span>)<br/><br/>This is the first FUTURE OF CODING interview since January 2022.<br/>It's an experimental pilot so it's for patrons only this time. Thank you to everyone who supports the podcast and I hope you enjoy this behind-the-scenes look!<br/><br/>I tried out various different editing techniques to give them a whirrrrrrr before the Real Interviews. Let me know what you think!!!!!<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Steve Krouse's wholesome interviews back in the day so I hope I can do them justice with a 2024/2025 version. I promise this first one is (at the very least) not boring. Any other qualities are up to you to determine.<br/><br/>Of course, many thanks to Philippa for helping me out and being my first victim (and we'll maybe see her again soon).

Really like <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Philippa Markovics</span>'s ideas about branching out to coding non-programmers.  Their mental model often differs remarkably from those with an algorithmic CS background.
