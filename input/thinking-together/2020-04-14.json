To be honest, it's very early days for these malleability ideas, so it seems natural. I am sure many people (esp. on HN) might not be interested when there's no startup to back or quick solution to try out today, and that's okay. For now, I'm mainly hoping to reach anyone interested in experimenting with these ideas or wanting to learn more about those who are doing so.\n\nAt the same time, there was some good discussion of finer details in a few of the sub-threads, and I hope it has at least planted a seed for people to think about the ideas over time. Even if people disagree or don't see the point in it today, hopefully they are at least now aware that some people do, and may be more open to such ideas down the road.\n\nSince the HN post appeared, a lot of new people have gotten in touch to share their excitement for these ideas, so overall I'd say the HN post was a positive step even if there are many confused people in the comments. Thanks to everyone here who may have waded in the HN comments with their own perspective. :smile:",

To be honest, it's very early days for these malleability ideas, so it seems natural. I am sure many people (esp. on HN) might not be interested when there's no startup to back or quick solution to try out today, and that's okay. For now, I'm mainly hoping to reach anyone interested in experimenting with these ideas or wanting to learn more about those who are doing so.\n\nAt the same time, there was some good discussion of finer details in a few of the sub-threads, and I hope it has at least planted a seed for people to think about the ideas over time. Even if people disagree or don't see the point in it today, hopefully they are at least now aware that some people do, and may be more open to such ideas down the road.\n\nSince the HN post appeared, a lot of new people have gotten in touch to share their excitement for these ideas, so overall I'd say the HN post was a positive step even if there are many confused people in the comments. Thanks to everyone here who may have waded in the HN comments with their own perspective. "
