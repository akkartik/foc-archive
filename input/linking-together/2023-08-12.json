It identifies three main qualities - liveness, richness, and composability.\n...\nThis allows domain-specific interactive programming tools to be integrated into general-purpose environments with full liveness. The document argues this can unlock new value for live and rich tools and programming research by enabling composition.

It identifies three main qualities - liveness, richness, and composability.\n...\nThis allows domain-specific interactive programming tools to be integrated into general-purpose environments with full liveness. The document argues this can unlock new value for live and rich tools and programming research by enabling composition. It lays out a vision for further exploring the design space at the intersection of liveness, richness, and composability.\n...\nfull summary (5 paragraphs): "
