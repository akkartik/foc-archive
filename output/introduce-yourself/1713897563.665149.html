Howdy from Austin, TX, USA.<br/><br/>My name's Chris, and I'm a software engineer at a SaaS company with a little background in graphic design and product design. As such, my coding experience is mostly front-end, UI stuff; and I'm really interested in usability, shortening feedback loops for users and developers, and what makes the real world so much more satisfying than the current digital landscape.<br/><br/>My love of programming started with trying to make games in Basic, but I haven't developed in that area since age 12.<br/><br/>My guiding principle is making the whole world customizable and mutable for everyone. Then reality would be a more accurate reflection of what people love instead of what they're stuck with. That encompasses arts, crafts, politics, and all creative disciplines - including programming.

Nice to hear you have thought about some guiding principles! Dovetails nicely with the "Elephant in the Room" podcast released here recently.
