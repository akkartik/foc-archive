I think I have a difficult topic but I still want to try bring it up. It is about how the culture of communication became so difficult that, I guess that even in the "IT-Space" we can feel its impact. How did come to this? That people are so hateful at each other that conflict resolution seems impossible. Instead of collaboration there are screams of outrage and disrespect.  As two examples I want to quote the recent John de Goes Event <a href="https://twitter.com/jdegoes/status/1168991784745230336">https://twitter.com/jdegoes/status/1168991784745230336</a> but also this event from the ethereum community: <a href="https://twitter.com/lorecirstea/status/1167747800626618368">https://twitter.com/lorecirstea/status/1167747800626618368</a>

I tend to follow Graydon’s approach to this when it comes to online and in-person technical communities:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/6ewjt5/question_about_rusts_odd_code_of_conduct/didrult/">https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/6ewjt5/question_about&hellip;</a><br/><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/6ewjt5/question_about_rusts_odd_code_of_conduct/dif1xvb/">https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/6ewjt5/question_about&hellip;</a>

This isn’t a new thing by any means - it’s important to understand that what we can do can be politicised, and that absolute tolerance can be easily gamed by the intolerant: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance</a><br/><br/>So far, De Goes has shown through his actions that he is at the very least, naive of this, and is willing to dig his heals on this, and at worst and enabler of the intolerant, and it’s good of Skillsmatter from distancing themselves until he figures this out. He’s still perfectly able to express his views in his own time, but I’d certainly be wary of attending conferences that invited him as a keynote speaker given the positions he currently holds.

On a wider perspective, we desperately need to promote interest in the humanities! It’s no accident that IT and STEM is an epicenter of this - the things we create will be used (and is being used) by the next wave of intolerance. We need to do our utmost to prevent this, and educate our peers on their role in this.
