For years I have seen static typing fanboys citing it as an example for why static typing is great, and for a while I took pleasure in commenting that no mainstream type system can actually be used to implement dimensional analysis. One reason is that it requires dependent types (not necessarily full-blown, but more than standard type systems can handle). The other reason is that is applies only to a subset of variables in a program, so any type system that insists on every variable having exactly one type is unsuitable for dimensional analysis.",

But dimensional analysis is also a good example to illustrate the communication issues between academia and software development. For years I have seen static typing fanboys citing it as an example for why static typing is great, and for a while I took pleasure in commenting that no mainstream type system can actually be used to implement dimensional analysis. One reason is that it requires dependent types (not necessarily full-blown, but more than standard type systems can handle). The other reason is that is applies only to a subset of variables in a program, so any type system that insists on every variable having exactly one type is unsuitable for dimensional analysis."
