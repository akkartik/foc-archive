(Do y'all call yourselves \"programmers\"? I can see a case for that seeming like a cooty-inducing term :smile:) My focus is more on a dynamic of \"productive\" software that insinuates itself into people's habits, and then exercises power (often accompanied by rent extraction). I think y'all are all good here. (Though do tell me if I seem to be mischaracterizing you, or if I sound like I'm excluding anyone. I tend to think of y'all's position as: you get a voice, but you don't bear much responsibility for what has occurred so far.)\n\n<@UJBAJNFLK> There are certainly many problems facing the world today, and my two paragraphs aren't intended to address them all. Re growth vs sustainability, I'll just point out that getting people to think hard about what we each find meaningful seems more resource-efficient than having whole countries go through the motions of bullshit jobs just to engage in zero-sum status games, all while mining the planet and polluting externalities. A focus on durable artifacts will hopefully lead to fewer artifacts.\n\nMy focus is just on programmers. I don't pretend to know enough to tell other industries or fields what to do.\n\n&lt;\/handwave&gt;\n\nI'm deliberately positioning the pledge at the level of individual projects. There's no limit on how many projects a person can start. At the same time, the start of a project is a high-leverage point at which to set its trajectory. I think we all have experience of joining projects later. It's much harder to change their direction then. Whatever the rules were at the start, we mostly tend to follow them.\n\nRe \"enterprise\", one thing I want to draw attention to is that the value capture limit is phrased as a raw number, not a per capita number. And it is not profit. These are two deliberate decisions. I tend to think there's something vaguely unethical about successful artifacts indefinitely milking society to hire increasing numbers of people for indefinite periods that mostly has the effect of degrading the artifact. I'd like it to be more \"glamorous\" to build something, freeze it and disband. (Like a game or a movie.) Get what you wanted out of it, then give it away. (Not like a game or movie at the moment.) Get out of the way for a new project to build on the artifact. This worldview considers one-time charges for products morally\/ethically superior to ongoing subscriptions. (Services of course are a separate matter. I don't have an opinion there. Though there might be an argument that programming is fundamentally about building artifacts, and the need for something to be an ongoing service is a failure on some level..)",
