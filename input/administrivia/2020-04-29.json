Clearly, interest is *not* the problem here. So how is the quote even relevant?

And it's why marginalized folks in your field may be involved in communities of their own and reluctant to join FoC, because they're a part of conversations that *already center* them and offer them leadership positions\/positions of power. And that makes sense. *What compels me to join FoC* if I have my own thriving intellectual communities already? (Not sure yet, I'll have to wait and see). \n• So more, actionably: *if you can't make them want to join\/participate in your community yet, support them where they're at*. What if FoC actively highlighted, cited, listened to, shared readings from, and collaborated with existing communities that are already building towards radically inclusive futures of computing (before drilling down on strategies to recruit that diversity into your own community)?

For me I actually have the opinion that women invented IT (<https:\/\/www.space.com\/34675-harvard-computers.html>) and with Grace Hopper and others, and men basically stole the whole IT field around the 1960s when it became big business (in those days women were looked down on in alot of society). Having said that there are some \"general\" differences in the sexes (on average I mean) that language can get in the way of expressing things which I think may happen with \"women are ...\"and \"men are ...\" type comments.

We do everything we can to hire women, but they just don't want to work in technical jobs for a variety of personal and historical reasons.
