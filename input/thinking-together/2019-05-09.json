Computation is not the frontier anymore.  Most software is now built across networks and collections of computers (UIs\/embedded being the large exceptions).  What do we have to gain by min-maxing programming a single machine? The glacial pace of innovation in this space since ~1990 should be a big wake up sign.  The future is wrangling distributed systems, which is something that single-machine Turing complete languages like to pretend is somebody else's problem."

And it should all have tests. (Because the 10 LoC have 40 LoC of tests, right? Right?) And you can prototype these in a single-machine language. It’s about choosing the right interfaces for the syscalls by which a computer interacts with its environment (including for bringing up and sending instructions to other computers).\n\nIs that what strat.world does? Or are you assuming a bunch of conventions? In which case the examples I want to see are about how people would go about violating your opinionated conventions.",

And it should all have tests. (Because the 10 LoC have 40 LoC of tests, right? Right?) And you can prototype these in a single-machine language. It’s about choosing the right interfaces for the syscalls by which a computer interacts with its environment (including for bringing up and sending instructions to other computers).\n\nIs that what strat.world does? Or are you assuming a bunch of conventions? In which case the examples I want to see are about how people would go about violating your opinionated conventions."

If that array exists on your computer in memory, your language can express iterating over that array as a trivial concept (for loops, streams, sequences, take your pick).  What constructs do you have to use if part of that array is in another machine, or in a database, etc?  The language and its view of the world _completely breaks down_.  You now have to spend X LOC writing clunky code that's abstractions over some OS syscalls to get that array close to hand so that the language can resume (and you can't resume unless you can bring the array close to hand!).\n\n\nAs humans we can express \"part of this array is _over there_\", but the languages we use have no concept of \"_over there_\", there is only _here_.   It's not a problem about abstracting over the oddities of networks, though that does play a part, its a problem of expressing _over there_ in a computer language.
