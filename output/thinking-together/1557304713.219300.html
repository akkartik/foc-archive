<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dan Cook</span> Thank you Dan for sharing this! I hadn't  heard of  François-René Rideau before, but his description and comparison of urbit is really one of the best I have found so far yet. Still it seems a bit too narrowly technical focused. I did very much like when the author used terms like micro and macro level, because it shows that we need better terminology to discuss about computing.  I think urbit tries to create a programming culture on its own. Yes it seems inaccessible but only so for people familiar with a programming context previously. I don't think that urbit has all the answers. But i DO think its asks interesting questions! Now articulating these questions and even arguing them is a whole different issue. I argue, we have come to the boundaries of usefullness of human natural lanugage to do. I'm uncertain how the future will unfold or if we ever will "fix" programming or technology will simply outpace us and brain computer interfaces make a lot of the things we do with computers today make look like incomprehensible child's play.
