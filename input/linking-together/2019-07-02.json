SDF is basically\n\n```\nfor each circle\n   is this ray in the circle\n```\n\nThat's O(N) per pixel.  It gets a little better using vertex shaders as you just draw the circles so O(1) but the more complex the circle positions the more you end up wasting GPU re-computing on every vertex (or pixel in fragment shaders) something you really should have only computed once and passed in.\n\nBasically these shader puzzles are almost always big perf loss because of that.\n\nThey are fun though",
