<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Drewverlee</span> Yes, I’d say that’s a fair representation. The trick seems to be to define (and prove) everything just with relationships, so that you don’t assume anything about the objects. Which makes it so generic. Because you make no assumptions about them at all, objects can be anything.<br/>That's where it's a step up over set theory, where a lot of the constructs and proofs are based on assumptions on the objects themselves, in addition to relations between them.<br/><br/>The trick++ later on then is to go all recursive or self-referential and stick the concepts of category theory itself (categories, functors, etc.) into those proven relationship-only constructs as categories and end up with even higher-level constructs which turn out to simplify some of the lower level proofs. At least that’s how I understand it currently.<br/>It's all fascinatingly weird and driven by obsessive over-optimization driving a concept to its extreme. :-)
