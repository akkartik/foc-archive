Hey All!<br/>I'm a software engineer by day, working on R&amp;D to make software easier and less expensive to maintain.<br/><br/>For the past couple of years, I've been interested in computational law. I worked a bit on an open source expert system as well as some tools for legal aid organizations in my spare time.<br/><br/>I'm really into personal finance, and I once made a spreadsheet that calculates all of my finances, think a personal double sided balance sheet. Coming back a year later though, it made the engineer side rather unsettled. From there I started researching trying to find (or possibly build) a "better Excel".<br/>And that research has led me here!

Come to the right place perhaps.

Haha, my first "coding" job was building a financial tracking spreadsheet for my Dad's financial planning business. Some of the nested if/then statements were a sight to behold.... but I was 15 and having a blast. Good luck on the research! I'm curious to hear how it goes.
