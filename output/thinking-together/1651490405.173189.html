<a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/design-for-the-future-but-balance-it-with-your-users-present#:~:text=Maya%20is%20an%20abbreviation%20for,able%20to%20accept%20and%20embrace.">The MAYA Principle</a><br/><br/>Loewy’s secret was essential to design for the future – but delivering the future gradually. He designed his famous logos, some of the most recognizable cars of the 40s, 50s, and 60s, refrigerators, and locomotives for his users’ present needs and skills while pushing the boundaries of design and technology beyond his users’ expectations. He called this approach the MAYA principle. Maya is an abbreviation for “<b>Most Advanced. Yet Acceptable.</b>” which means that Loewy sought to give his users the most advanced design, but not more advanced than what they were able to accept and embrace. Loewy believed that:<br/><br/>&gt; <em>"The adult public's taste is not necessarily ready to accept the logical solutions to their requirements if the solution implies too vast a departure from what they have been conditioned into accepting as the norm."</em><br/>
