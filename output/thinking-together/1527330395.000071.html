<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Guido Bartolucci</span> That's what you get for sharing your reading list.  :wink:<br/><br/>On Category Theory, you may find success with "Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory" <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316">https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316</a>.  (Just started though Fong and Spivak have certainly have written other interesting things.)<br/><br/>Math texts often devolve into a trite definition-theorem-proof style with little justification for why those specific definitions, theorems, and proofs are of special interest.  Category Theory doubly so as a framework for understanding mathematical relationships.  Take Awodey's text <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Category-Theory-Oxford-Logic-Guides/dp/0199237182/">https://www.amazon.com/Category-Theory-Oxford-Logic-Guides/dp/0199237182/</a> as an example.<br/><br/>Riehl presents a thorough argument answering "why Category Theory?" aimed squarely at mathematicians <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conceptual-Mathematics-First-Introduction-Categories/dp/052171916X">https://www.amazon.com/Conceptual-Mathematics-First-Introduc&hellip;</a>.  What about the rest of us?<br/><br/>There's Lawvere and Schanuel introduction <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conceptual-Mathematics-First-Introduction-Categories/dp/052171916X">https://www.amazon.com/Conceptual-Mathematics-First-Introduc&hellip;</a> that amounts to "gee-whiz sums and products make sense for all sorts of things besides numbers."<br/><br/>On that backdrop, I'm hopeful that Fong and Spivak will prove a more provocative introduction for people like you Guido: more substance than Lawvere and Schanuel, less esoteric than Riehl.<br/><br/>(Some of you may notice that this approach to talking about a book is categorical in the sense that I described one in its relation to others.)
