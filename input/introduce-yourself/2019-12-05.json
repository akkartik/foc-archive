VP Technology at <http:\/\/www.schoox.com|www.schoox.com> and General Counsel and BTC enthusiast at <http:\/\/www.unchained-capital.com|www.unchained-capital.com>. I do most of my dayjob coding in Scala right now, but tons of polyglot stuff wherever I go. I have a feeling I know (or rather know of) many of you in here, and I'm angry at <@UCUSW7WVD> for not telling me about this group until today :slightly_smiling_face:. Just a short scroll up <#C5T9GPWFL|thinking-together> tells me that this group addresses lots of my interests, but I think it will take me a week to get through the 64-post-long (so far) thread from yesterday. I've been interested in, listening to, and playing with Tidal for a long time, so having <@UF89Z7SRF> in here for me is like being in a Slack group with Taylor Swift for a 13 year old girl :heart_eyes:. And wow ... while I was searching for \"alex,\" <@UL3EE9WR1> popped up ... I was at the first 4 Strange Loops ... the first one was where I saw Scala for the first time! Glad to finally be in here.",
