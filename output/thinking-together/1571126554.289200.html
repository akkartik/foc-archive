an interesting phenomena that should be of interest for people on foc: there's python which is used a lot, and then there's pypy, which is almost 100% compatible with python and  &gt; 4x faster, and almost nobody uses it. The non adoption of it should be a warning for people developing new and better technologies and expecting them to be adopted just because they are better.
