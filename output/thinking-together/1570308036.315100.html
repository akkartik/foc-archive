<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tim Babb</span> I think if you spoke to the authors of these systems, they'd say they're building the simplest possible system with the constraints they need. Simplicity is a high priority, but it's more important to not lose packets, or to make sure people's games aren't slower than they used to be, and so on.<br/><br/>Saying "simplicity is important" doesn't really address these concerns. To talk about simplicity you have to make a case for what one should be willing to give up in exchange.
