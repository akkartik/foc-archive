I’ve been using LabVIEW for nearly 30 years, and a few years back I started exploring re-writing LabVIEW in LabVIEW. I’ve got a lot of interesting ideas in this space (many of them working) and am now starting to implement them in modern web technologies and with AI co-pilot capabilities. I’m also very interested in visual languages as a means for more efficiently interacting with AI (and parallel compute targets) as a means for having visibility into proposed actions by AI agents and enable human accountability for such systems to keep them safe. I’m looking forward to sharing ideas and successes.
