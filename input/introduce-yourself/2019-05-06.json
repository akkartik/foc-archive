We think we work with one program mostly but in reality we work with a cacophony of them and other non-programmy things (shared libraries - are they inside my program or outside?). Roughly a program seems like a static description of some automated **process**. I'd argue that the processes of interest mostly span slices across multiple such definitions. I'm trying to focus away from the idea of a program and instead think about the larger context of the 'system'. See <https:\/\/shalabh.com\/programmable-systems\/systems-not-programs.html>",

We think we work with one program mostly but in reality we work with a cacophony of them and other non-programmy things (shared libraries - are they inside my program or outside?). Roughly a program seems like a static description of some automated **process**. I'd argue that the processes of interest mostly span slices across multiple such definitions. I'm trying to focus away from the idea of a program and instead think about the larger context of the 'system'. See "
