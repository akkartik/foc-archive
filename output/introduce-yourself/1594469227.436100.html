Hello everyone :wave:<br/>My name is Tim and I’ve found this community through the Future of coding podcast, episode about relational algebra. <br/><br/>I was always interested in such things like frame-based editing, new ways to program a computer, etc. And I couldn’t imagine that there is a community who also explore “future of coding” :grin:<br/>I’m really excited to be here! <br/><br/>Now I’m exploring the idea to apply relational model to managing state in mobile applications. The main goal is to make mobile app development easier, less error prone and reduce amount of code that mobile developers usually write. <br/><br/>I’m not sure why, but currently mobile applications usually contain SO much code and accidentall complexity that it blows my mind. An app for mobile phone can easily grow to millions of lines of code for moderate functionality and I’m believe we can do better.<br/><br/>I’ve started with Rich Hickey’s talks and “Out of the tar pit” paper and we’ll see where I can get with it.

Welcome to the group. You will find that the main reason mobile apps are so large is that they rely on too many framework and modules, which because of their interconnected/tangled dependency chains result in gigantic code bases (in total). But actually the mobile apps are quite small in their core function. You will find many projects on the spreadsheet for this group that are tackling the central problems from many different angles.<br/><br/>All programming is abstract algebra, which is a fairly new field as far as mathematics goes.

Thanks!<br/>Yes, you absolutely right about frameworks and modules. I’m not that familiar with other fields (like backend development or web), but mobile devs tend to use a lot of frameworks and also a lot of abstractions. Most of us believe in some kind of “architecture”, applying principles without understanding why we are doing this :smile:<br/>If you open up almost any android codebase, you’ll see 100k+ lines of code, where 60% of it will be some kind of DI management.
