                "text": "The Latin term characteristica universalis, commonly interpreted as universal characteristic, or universal character in English, is a universal and formal language imagined by Gottfried Leibniz able to express mathematical, scientific, and metaphysical concepts. Leibniz thus hoped to create a language usable within the framework of a universal logical calculation or calculus ratiocinator.\nThe characteristica universalis is a recurring concept in the writings of Leibniz. When writing in French, he sometimes employed the phrase spécieuse générale to the same effect. The concept is sometimes paired with his notion of a calculus ratiocinator and with his plans for an encyclopaedia as a compendium of all human knowledge.",

You should all know that Leibniz (1646-1716), as in the other originator of calculus and the d\/dx notation, toyed with the idea of a language, a symbol system in which geometric composition of the symbols would correspond in some natural way to inference.  At thirty, it thought the project could be completed in five years.\n\nAt 60, he still liked the idea, though imagined more investigators would be necessary, \"It is true that in the past I planned a new way of calculating suitable for matters which have nothing in common with mathematics [\"mathematics\" seems to have been defined more narrowly 300 years ago], and if this kind of logic were put into practice, every reasoning, even probabilistic ones, would be like that of the mathematician: if need be, the lesser minds which had application and good will could, if not accompany the greatest minds, then at least follow them. For one could always say: let us calculate, and judge correctly through this, as much as the data and reason can provide us with the means for it. But I do not know if I will ever be in a position to carry out such a project, which requires more than one hand; and it even seems that mankind is still not mature enough to lay claim to the advantages which this method could provide.\"\n\nBy 70, he lamented, \"I have spoken to the Marquis de l'Hôpital and others about my general algebra, but they have paid no more attention to it than if I had told them about a dream of mine. I should have to support it too by some obvious application, but to achieve this it would be necessary to work out at least a part of my characteristic, a task which is not easy, especially in my present condition and without the advantage of discussions with men who could stimulate and help me in work of this nature.\"\n\nCould have used a friendly Slack.",

You should all know that Leibniz (1646-1716), as in the other originator of calculus and the d\/dx notation, toyed with the idea of a language, a symbol system in which geometric composition of the symbols would correspond in some natural way to inference.  At thirty, it thought the project could be completed in five years.\n\nAt 60, he still liked the idea, though imagined more investigators would be necessary, \"It is true that in the past I planned a new way of calculating suitable for matters which have nothing in common with mathematics [\"mathematics\" seems to have been defined more narrowly 300 years ago], and if this kind of logic were put into practice, every reasoning, even probabilistic ones, would be like that of the mathematician: if need be, the lesser minds which had application and good will could, if not accompany the greatest minds, then at least follow them. For one could always say: let us calculate, and judge correctly through this, as much as the data and reason can provide us with the means for it. But I do not know if I will ever be in a position to carry out such a project, which requires more than one hand; and it even seems that mankind is still not mature enough to lay claim to the advantages which this method could provide.\"\n\nBy 70, he lamented, \"I have spoken to the Marquis de l'Hôpital and others about my general algebra, but they have paid no more attention to it than if I had told them about a dream of mine. I should have to support it too by some obvious application, but to achieve this it would be necessary to work out at least a part of my characteristic, a task which is not easy, especially in my present condition and without the advantage of discussions with men who could stimulate and help me in work of this nature.\"\n\nCould have used a friendly Slack."
