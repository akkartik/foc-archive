        "text": "To keep this thread going and add my 2 cents. I think this is a needed discussion and one that I’m happy to see. I agree with basically all of <@UC2A2ARPT>’s critiques and concerns.\nIf we’re talking about a small change to match the scope better, I think going from “Coding” to “Computing” is a great fit, as many have said already. I already swap these out in my head when I hear “Future of Coding”.\n\nAs for a more radical shift, I agree that “Systems” is a very appropriate scope, and adaptable. It also has a solid foundation (Systems sciences, etc) and I think is a less misleading term than “coding”. We all care about systems, but only some of us care about the “coding” part. How to make a name out of it I’m less sure.\n\nCybernetics is also an interesting choice, but while it’s one I use a fair bit in my work I don’t know if It’s one that matches how this community sees itself, but that could change!\n\nCybernetics, especially second-order cybernetics, is deeply concerned with the interaction between people and systems. This relationship is certainly essential to what we want to do: change the relationship between people and computing. From the scale of individuals, groups, society, etc. The circular feedback loop here is what makes this ‘second order’ cybernetics fyi (as in, cybernetics applied to itself).\n\nIt’s also the study of self-organisation in complex systems, this part I *really* like. And I’d even posit we need a far stronger focus on this as a community if we want to see things change. A slight shift from _individual FoC projects_ to also include systems that _enable self-organisation (communication, collaboration, coordination, knowledge synthesis, etc)_ would be a welcome shift.\n\nPut succinctly, I think there is no FoC without cybernetics.\n\nVeered off a bit from naming towards community identity, but felt relevant. I like this discussion, hoping it continues!",
