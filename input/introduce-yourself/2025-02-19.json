Here is a little bit more of a background about me that might help.\nI’m an ex-military nurse, and my interest in coding was sparked during my time managing the development of a women’s health application for the military. While I wasn’t directly involved in the coding process, that experience ignited a strong interest in the field.\nI’ve since found a coding training program offered by a bank specifically for ex-service personnel. I’m eager to apply and take this next step, but before diving into the program, I want to make sure I have a solid foundation in coding. My primary focus right now is to build this skillset, and I believe this training program will provide a great opportunity to explore different areas of coding within the financial sector. Although healthcare is an area I’m familiar with, it’s not my main focus at this time.\nWith that in mind, I’d love some advice and guidance from those who’ve been in similar positions:\n• Are there any books you would recommend for someone just starting out?\n• I’ve already signed up for a beginner course on Codecademy to learn Java (the language I’ll be using if I’m selected for the program), but any other resources or tips would be greatly appreciated! Would anyone recommend another free beginners course into Java? \n• Has anyone else transitioned from a healthcare or military background into tech, and if so, what was your experience?\nI’m really excited to develop this new skill set and would be grateful for any insights or suggestions you may have. Thanks in advance!",
