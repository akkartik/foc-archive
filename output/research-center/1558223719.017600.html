Re: Remote vs local. This could also be a chance for the open source philosophy to shine. While I’m not sure all that I think  about open-source all the way down, it has enabled amazing things. I’m reminded in particular of an epidemic outbreak of disease that was rapidly quelled because researchers all around the world posted their results on GitHub and were able to work in parallel.<br/>That said, local is definitely more productive. There’s just not question that the quality of interaction and focus is better when you’re in the same room.
