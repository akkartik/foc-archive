        "text": "Zooming out, I think at this point I buy your argument that this methodology leads to more correct, parsimonious programs. The big question for me is how onerous the Architect's task is.\n\nThere have been other practices in the past that have decent track records of improving the state of software. Stuff like <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cleanroom_software_engineering|cleanroom> and so on. <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Category:Software_quality|Wikipedia has a long list.> I get the sense many of these practices don't get used much because they make the human task too onerous. Or to put it differently, in our current society there's often a mismatch between the amount of attention a task needs from a human and the amount of attention society is organized to provide to it. It's unclear how much a new methodology benefits just from making humans pay more attention.\n\nI guess I'm repeating something I've said in the past: the best way to make your case is to go forth and write more programs, more non-trivial programs. What's the most complex program you've written so far? Well, \"complex\" is a bit of an unfortunate word in this conversation. Perhaps I should ask what program has most impacted your life by the results of running it (ignoring the intellectual process of creating it, which provides its own benefits for sure)\n\nThis has basically been my tack to my own solutions. By trying to minimize software updates, forking instead of updating a shared codebase, etc, I'm hopefully providing more evidence to persuade others to use those practices (or persuade myself to stop using them)",

It's unclear how much a new methodology benefits just from making humans pay more attention.\n\nI guess I'm repeating something I've said in the past: the best way to make your case is to go forth and write more programs, more non-trivial programs.
