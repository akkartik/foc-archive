What should happen when a line gets too long for the screen? What should happen as values on the stack get wide? Or deep? My screen objects (<https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/C0120A3L30R\/p1605244930088000>) explored multi-line values on the stack, but it feels wasteful to repeatedly show screens, especially as the screen sizes grow larger and more realistic\/useful.\n\n* Many attempts to add capabilities hit the scaling limits even faster. If I try to reimplement shell utilities like `grep` I need to support files with at least 50-character lines. Requesting URLs on the internet also requires showing long URL strings on the stack.\n\n* One thing I keep rubbing up against is the distinction between editing a program and browsing its state. Bret Victor's demos like <https:\/\/vimeo.com\/36579366> consistently gloss over this. Yes, it's nice to be able to play what-if experiments with your program, but you quickly realize you need to unwind one experiment to try out another. Either you need smart undo, with the ability to somehow drop milestones into the timeline after the fact. Or you need to somehow separate browsing operations from manipulations of the program itself. It feels more feasible to show many copies of a screen object if most of them stay collapsed. Or to truncate URLs if they can be expanded on demand.\n\nI do have one more idea for an interesting demo: supporting APL-like array operations. But I'm not sure if I should go down that road if there are potentially fatal problems with this whole approach.\n\nA Mu-specific constraint here is the lack of a mouse. My UI has a single point on the screen where I can manipulate things. There's no mouse, because mouse support in text-mode terminals is non-standard and requires understanding differences between terminals. Which requires dependencies beyond a Linux kernel. That's something I've managed to sidestep so far by staying extremely lowest-common-denominator in terminal capabilities.\n\nPerhaps I'll switch gears and focus on getting off the Linux kernel. Then I won't need to worry about terminal compatibilities. But then people would be required to use Qemu to play with Mu. Which sucks :confused: Perhaps that's the fundamental psychological block here: I want to keep Mu easy to try out, but beyond a point I can't undo bad historical decisions without adding some friction to checking it out. Then again, it's not like many people try it out anyway, and requiring Linux is just as much friction for someone on a Mac. Yeah, perhaps there's more OS hacking in my future. Thoughts\/suggestions appreciated on this angle as well.",

Yes, it's nice to be able to play what-if experiments with your program, but you quickly realize you need to unwind one experiment to try out another. Either you need smart undo, with the ability to somehow drop milestones into the timeline after the fact. Or you need to somehow separate browsing operations from manipulations of the program itself. It feels more feasible to show many copies of a screen object if most of them stay collapsed. Or to truncate URLs if they can be expanded on demand.\n\nI do have one more idea for an interesting demo: supporting APL-like array operations. But I'm not sure if I should go down that road if there are potentially fatal problems with this whole approach.\n\nA Mu-specific constraint here is the lack of a mouse. My UI has a single point on the screen where I can manipulate things. There's no mouse, because mouse support in text-mode terminals is non-standard and requires understanding differences between terminals. Which requires dependencies beyond a Linux kernel. That's something I've managed to sidestep so far by staying extremely lowest-common-denominator in terminal capabilities.\n\nPerhaps I'll switch gears and focus on getting off the Linux kernel. Then I won't need to worry about terminal compatibilities. But then people would be required to use Qemu to play with Mu. Which sucks "

Then again, it's not like many people try it out anyway, and requiring Linux is just as much friction for someone on a Mac. Yeah, perhaps there's more OS hacking in my future.

The first section describes a problem that many non-technies would recognize, but I doubt they would make much of the technical details that follow. As a rule of thumb, when you talk about \"objects\" you are addressing an audience of people with programming experience.\n\nPutting on my \"programmer but not professional\" hat, the description is pretty clear. But with that perspective, I'd want to know how the Object Network differs e.g. from the Fediverse. And when I see \"live\" (and thus mutable) objects, I immediately wonder about access rights, authentification, etc."
