        "text": "I’ve just finished Will Wright’s Masterclass course about game design. I almost didn’t look at it because I’m not working on games. Thankfully, I was still interested enough to take a look, and I recommend it to anyone who’s designing systems of any kind.\n<https:\/\/www.masterclass.com\/classes\/will-wright-teaches-game-design-and-theory|https:\/\/www.masterclass.com\/classes\/will-wright-teaches-game-design-and-theory>\n\nWill Wright is known for games like Sim City, The Sims, and Spore — all very complex open-ended simulations. The knowledge he shares about designing these simulations are super valuable, not just for games. It’s the most compelling course about how to design systems I am aware of.\n\nNow, Masterclass has a pretty high paywall, so I was looking for material on the web from him that comes close, and I found this YouTube video: <https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=CdgQyq3hEPo|https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=CdgQyq3hEPo>\n\nIt’s much older from 2003 but clearly a lot of his ideas from then made it into the Masterclass. Don’t skip the Q&amp;A, lots of interesting stuff in there too.\n\nThink of his Masterclass as a longer, refined, more detailed course with exceptional production quality. If this sounds like an ad, it probably is. I’m not affiliated with them at all and don’t get anything from promoting them. I’m just deeply impressed with the quality (which also applies to other classes I’ve watched). If you end up watching it, please let me know what you think.",

        "text": "Just a random data point. I wrote some system that required users to open a Terminal\/command line and install node, npm my system and run it from the command line. It got chosen by a university to be part of a class mostly full of artist students using Unity for interactive art projects. I became very clear almost immediately that any interaction with the terminal\/command line was a nightmare for these students.\n\nSimple things like typos, understanding current directories, etc were all foreign concepts.\n\nI ended up re-writing my system as a unity plugin to remove any need to touch the command line.\n\nThat doesn't mean I think the command line is dead. Just passing on an anecdote. As a dev it might be normal but looking around at non devs I certainly don't see much command line use.\n\nAs a dev though I have a hard time seeing the command line disappearing. command lines are somewhat cross platform. non-commandlines are using app specific. command lines have history, scrollback, search, search through history, command completion, filename completion, ...\n\nMaybe there is some magic UI that could do all of that kind of stuff as proficiently as the command line but I'm not sure what it would be. Picking \"file open\" or \"execute file\" and selecting from some kind of list doesn't sound efficient to me. It certainly hasn't been in the past. Further, in dev I'm often automating things via scripts. Scripts are often just multiple command lines. That is what bash is really. It's a REPL for bash scripts. So, to me, it makes sense that I will need to automate various build steps, I'll do that with some scripting language, I don't see what not having a command line would help here except to make it harder to test small things that I build up my scripts with.\n\nI am bullish on VR or AR changing dev environments. Even if just lots of virtual monitors. But, assuming they figure out finger detection and more, UIs could change a lot. Working though touchpads, mice, and touchsceens is basically like 1.5 fingers in use. With full finger recongnition I can push, pull, twist, stretch, squash, and many other things for which there is no easy analog with current common input devices. Also a 3D workspace that VR\/AR opens gives a lot more room for innovation than our 2D monitors.",

                                "text": "Just a random data point. I wrote some system that required users to open a Terminal\/command line and install node, npm my system and run it from the command line. It got chosen by a university to be part of a class mostly full of artist students using Unity for interactive art projects. I became very clear almost immediately that any interaction with the terminal\/command line was a nightmare for these students.\n\nSimple things like typos, understanding current directories, etc were all foreign concepts.\n\nI ended up re-writing my system as a unity plugin to remove any need to touch the command line.\n\nThat doesn't mean I think the command line is dead. Just passing on an anecdote. As a dev it might be normal but looking around at non devs I certainly don't see much command line use.\n\nAs a dev though I have a hard time seeing the command line disappearing. command lines are somewhat cross platform. non-commandlines are using app specific. command lines have history, scrollback, search, search through history, command completion, filename completion, ...\n\nMaybe there is some magic UI that could do all of that kind of stuff as proficiently as the command line but I'm not sure what it would be. Picking \"file open\" or \"execute file\" and selecting from some kind of list doesn't sound efficient to me. It certainly hasn't been in the past. Further, in dev I'm often automating things via scripts. Scripts are often just multiple command lines. That is what bash is really. It's a REPL for bash scripts. So, to me, it makes sense that I will need to automate various build steps, I'll do that with some scripting language, I don't see what not having a command line would help here except to make it harder to test small things that I build up my scripts with.\n\nI am bullish on VR or AR changing dev environments. Even if just lots of virtual monitors. But, assuming they figure out finger detection and more, UIs could change a lot. Working though touchpads, mice, and touchsceens is basically like 1.5 fingers in use. With full finger recongnition I can push, pull, twist, stretch, squash, and many other things for which there is no easy analog with current common input devices. Also a 3D workspace that VR\/AR opens gives a lot more room for innovation than our 2D monitors."
