I don't trust it, because it makes mistakes. But when it makes mistakes I can give it the error message and my hunch as to what is going wrong, and it tries again. That, I have found, is more efficient that me making the mistake, and me finding the solution, because ChatGPT's first guess is closer than mine would have been, and it is much better at getting it right on the second or third try.
