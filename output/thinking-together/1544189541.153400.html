Coding tools for the blind. Honestly, I had this idea only because sharp young minds need to keep moving. Sitting and looking at the screen turns some young minds that could think out of the box and be very innovative away from coding just because it is a sitting all day “activity.” Teaching to program very young children has to be through activity. Building blocks the closest thing to it right now. Perhaps there are should be new kind of building blocks for kids that introduce computer languages. Just a thought this morning.
