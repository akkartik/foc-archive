Here is one idea I was thinking of this morning. Maps and GPS. Imagine trying to get somewhere knowing the name of destination but never really see the map that would include your position and position of your destination with things around and between? Imagine only having GPS that can take you point to point. As a human being what would you choose? Computer will be happy with GPS you provide for it. But you as a human being? Difference between human mind and computer “thinking” is ability and need for higher level of abstraction. So would you choose to have a map or having only GPS is fine? The fact that we stopped using maps in our real travel brought us into scenarios where education is more like having GPS without ever seeing a map.  Higher level of abstractions and creation of “bird views” in my personal opinion are really needed. Tools that allow such view, education materials that create such views. Tutorials, books, films, animation, cartoon books, computer games. “Maps” should be created.   Any coding requires  an Overview first, it helps to get the best path ( algorithm). Teaching programming needs to teach an ability for an overview of things by using an overview of things.

There are many of us here that seem to be positive towards the importance of being able to see the data, esp the data as it changes. And also renderings of the data: show GPS as a map, show a contact as a contact card, show some custom visualisation and watch it change live, etc. Would that be the kind of thing you mean?

&gt; Difference between human mind and computer “thinking” is ability and need for higher level of abstraction.<br/><br/>I would call it sense of direction. Human wants to see the route, so he could go back if something went wrong.<br/><br/>Similar thing in computing will be execution timeline, when you could go back in time, unroll execution.

Yes. in programming terms is watching the data transformed. As watching apples transformed in apple pie cooking. So many times when you are watching apples, you are not watching the crust, amount of sugar, temperature, time. In cooking when you see your crust being raw, you know what to fix because you have an overview what ingredients make a pie and what transformation each ingredient has to make. The tool that allows you to have this overview at all time can help  making a good pie. You can go back into time when you were adding sugar to the apples but if it a temperature and time that really mattered - you are not solving a problem. Good tool that keeps an overview of the pie with states of their ingredients can point out to the problem why your pie is not very good to eat. To make that tool one needs to have an overview. For users of such tool educational materials need to teach to recognize the overview. It is difficult to find resources that can give you an overview of things. I am saying form my own experience as a self-taught. I have to buy a few books, few courses on the same subject because  only going through compartmental explanations in each of them I can build some sense of overview on the subject and only then I can feel that I understand what I am coding.

This is an example I wrote after going through long resources on closure explanation. I do not know if my explanation is good but it is what I gathered in overview sense for myself.

coding will be needed not just for specialists and solely educated in computer science. although it is up to specialists to create tools and educational materials. I am not such specialist. Not yet. I am just happy to be a part of the group that thinks about the future and direction and I just want to share my view and opinion ( so far) on what I see is happening and what I feel is needed.

The GPS vs map is a fantastic analogy. Much of learning now are guided tutorials on how to accomplish some incremental goal, but they don't really cover the higher level view. It is exactly like following GPS turn-by-turn directions only and then trying to 'think up' what the map looks like. Unfortunately the amount of manufactured complexity one has to wade through is immense.

I agree. But the only ways I know of  to get any sort of visualization of how a program works are:<br/><br/>1. Read the code and build a diagram yourself with <a href="http://Draw.io">Draw.io</a> or something like that. Ths is a very slow, manual process, but works well.<br/><br/>2. Use a debugger. The Chrome devtools are the best. You can use devtools to debug non-browser-based Javascript as well. Works well for… well, debugging (viewing all the state around a certain line of code).<br/><br/>3. Dumping a bunch of info to log files and reading through those. Lately I’ve been experimenting with a better way of doing this. I just pushed this to GitHub a few minutes ago:  <a href="https://github.com/JesseAldridge/varlog">https://github.com/JesseAldridge/varlog</a> The idea is you add a few print statements to your code, dump the output to a normal-looking log file, and then convert that log file into a spreadsheet which gives you an overview of how variables change over time. My hunch is this project will have a high cost/benefit ratio in terms of development time — it’s pretty easy to implement and seeing a spreadsheet full of variables changing over time is a very powerful way to understand what code is doing.
