<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dustin Getz</span>: re "I think the point of Urbit is that from the Martianâ€™s perspective, it is us javascript plebs who are the nutty ones"  not quite so, I think one of the challenges of discovering what computation is about , remember alan kay says the computer revolution hasn't happend yet, is to explore the relationship between the individual and the group. Terms like "persistence" or "identity" try to negotiate between those. As humans we can not extract ourselves from neither our human history nor our biological history. So we are complex and mostly contradictory beings and we suffer through life. But we create technology and technology gives us mechanisms to reflect about ourselves and simultaneously changes our behavior. Its both a  conscious and unconscious process. So this is Urbit an attempt to collapse layers of technical and maybe historical complexity into something more useful.
