Some random thoughts after reading it once:<br/><br/>1. Weren’t the first computers also more like the Smalltalk system then, when we still set state directly, before being able to read in serialized programs from punch cards, and later (paper or magnetic) tapes? The point being: maybe the serialized aspect isn’t as important as a distinction?<br/><br/>2. I see what you’re doing to prevent premature definitions, but ultimately just “system” feels to unspecific. Everything is a system these days. Are we talking about interactive (non-)deterministic systems here? Do these properties help us to better define what we’re designing? Surely bringing up UI locks you into a more specific type of system. But maybe UI doesn’t have to be involved and are we then talking about a different kind of system?<br/><br/>3. I always felt that there is a step we take when we move from a program that is basically just a more complex function (start-input-calculate-output-done) or collection of computations to something that is based on a core loop, which is sometimes also called a simulation. There is certainly a difference between these and it might or might not be important for what you want to get at.<br/>To me it feels we left “programs” behind a long time ago and misuse the name for things that aren’t really programs anymore, and that’s just confusing everyone.<br/><br/>4. I wholeheartedly agree that this is about “designing systems” and that “programming” as in modifying a serial representation of instructions with symbols is just one way of designing these systems.

Thinking about my point 3 above more I noticed that I used a very imperative way of expressing it with computations and loops, and I was just wondering what a more declarative/functional way of describing that difference between program and system as I defined it (probably wrongly) would be?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Shalabh</span> Altogether I agree with the ideas in your post, but I think it's vague. It's not educational (and I'm not sure if it's supposed to be), because it requires your audience to already share your mindset.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> Also interestingly, functions are easily composable, but we don't really know how to compose reactive programs. That's because composing functions merely gives you another function, but composing reactive programs gives you a concurrent system!

&gt; Along a different direction, we can also consider replacing the write-then-run program idea (this is the ‘submit a paper’ model) with an incremental model where the programmer successively provides more detail about the desired behavior and a constraint solving system refines the behavior (this is the ‘have a conversation’ model).<br/><br/>Also was thinking about this, like very much this idea.<br/><br/>Human manually takes input from certain source. Then manually processes that concrete input (as we often do in repl). Environment records it as a scenario.<br/><br/>Having at least two scenarios environment tries to generalize them and produce a program, which tries to process similar input.<br/><br/>If it derived several ways process some piece of input, it will ask human for assistance. Ask to make a choice of correct one, or solve it manually.<br/><br/>So program becomes just a collection of recorded interactions that were manually conducted by human.

But I have no understanding how hard it would be to produce that kind of generalization of scenarios. Especially if it involves several inputs and outputs.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nick Smith</span> the target is definitely 'future of programming' or broadly 'future of computing'. The purpose is also to refine these ideas by discussion in forums such as this. It's also to state a specific position, e.g. sometimes I encounter the position that 'compile time' is absolutely fundamental to programming ("because a program is a mathematical construct and it deals with concepts like proofs".. hmm perhaps that whole discussion should be a separate post.) See also the 'programmable systems' link at the top.

&gt; We could imagine a system where each object has internal space which holds a cluster of inner objects, and so on. This introduces a recursive aspect in the design.<br/><br/>That right there is my current obsession. In fact, the whole "Axes of Freedom" section is a pretty complete list of the things I'm actively working on — nested structure, interactive refinement, managed time. I enjoyed the post quite a lot. I don't feel there was a lack of clarity around the audience (to me, the audience was clearly <em>you</em> — this was a statement of purpose, not a call to arms). I'm interested in seeing what steps you take to pursue this vision.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> - great points.<br/>&gt;  “system” feels to unspecific. Everything is a system these days.<br/>I agree. Even a program can be thought of as a 'system'.  I struggle with how to phrase this better. I could start with 'just physical hardware' but I do want to include the idea of 'software', even while not adding any notions of what the software looks like.<br/><br/>&gt; I always felt that there is a step we take when we move from a program that is basically just a more complex function (start-input-calculate-output-done) or collection of computations to something that is based on a core loop, which is sometimes also called a simulation.<br/><br/>Interesting.. the later model can simulate any system so it's a virtual system in that sense.<br/><br/>&gt; a more declarative/functional way of describing that difference between program and system as I defined it (probably wrongly) would be?<br/><br/>I struggled with precise definitions too and then gave up because these are all made up categories in the study of artificial machines. To me the system <b>provides</b> the idea of a program. The program is operated on from the 'outside' - you write it, run it etc. so there is other stuff outside of the program that lets you do this - these are parts of the system outside the program.<br/><br/>Instead of definitions, what I'm trying to identify are the typical connotations associated with 'a program' - e.g. the fact that it has two 'views': the static structural internal view in the programming language and the dynamic interactive run time view (in the UI language?). Another one is that whenever you run it, it starts afresh and the internal state is reset. Identifying these might indicate room to explore for whatever other abstractions we design.
