Hi all, very surprised it took me this long to find a group of people interested in this stuff (for a long time I just called it Bret Victor things). Curious and happy that I found this group:slightly_smiling_face:

My main interests are in psychology/introspection/meditation, which if programming=thought, then programming=emotions, programming=pain/pleasure (or to be more precise expressions of emotions, expressions of pain, expressions of any psychic content).<br/><br/>So tools for thought could also be tools for emotions. Emotions are just nonverbal thoughts, anyway. I hope all this progress that we have made with tools where you can see your own ideas =&gt; can be propagated to tools where you can see your own psychological conflicts and problems.<br/><br/>Art has been doing this for millennia (representing our psyche), why can't interactive computing environments do it? Anyhow glad to join
