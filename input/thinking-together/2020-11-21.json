For example:\n\n```The IETF community works mostly online, guided by the informal principle: \"we believe in rough consensus and running code\".\n\nThe IETF's mission is to make the Internet work better by producing high quality, relevant technical documents that influence the way people design, use, and manage the Internet. IETF standards are built on the combined engineering judgement of participants, including individuals from academia and network operators, router vendors and open source projects. Success is measured by the extent that the protocols and practices developed in the IETF is used to make the Internet work better.```",
