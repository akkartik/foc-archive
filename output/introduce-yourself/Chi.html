Hello, I am currently a student at a coding bootcamp in San Francisco. I have been trying to learn on my own but decided it is best to be in a formal class since I tend to  jump around a lot. I am a Smalltalk fan and love reading about the history of the language and have volunteered for the eruopean smalltalk user group last year. My goal is to contribute to Pharo. I currently am reading Mindstorms by Seymour Papert bc I love thinking about how we learn. I hope that I can find some friends/mentors in this community!
