Hey all, I'm Gabriel, and this is my first time sharing Flyde here - a flow-based programming platform I've been working on lately.<br/>I'm a big fan of FBP and am convinced it didn't catch due to 2 factors:<br/>1. previous attempt's had GUIs that weren't good enough. They didn't take complete advantage of the visual layer<br/>2. implementation was hard and integration with existing workflows (ci/cd, version control) was almost impossible<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hdUKGZEYUw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hdUKGZEYUw</a><br/><br/>Feedback is welcome! and looking forward to share more progress in the future :man_dancing:

Looks nice!<br/>It’s cool to see incremental projects that look like they can actually be used in real projects today.<br/><br/>Also, are you in Israel? If we collect several of us then perhaps it’s possible to make a local meetup :)

Yeah, that is very cool. Any thought of going two-directions, so changes in the code result in changes in the flow diagram? Any ideas for how to visualize diffs in the flow interface? Have you considered using zoom to enter into blocks instead of page switching? I feel like zoom has some uncaptured utility for nested structures.

Hey <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jason Morris</span>  sorry missed that completely. Better late than never :blush: <br/>1. I believe that to truly create a new level of abstraction I need to sacrifice such ability, as the code generated will probably  lose the benefits of the visual flow. I'm taking a more code-integrated approach, which I will share here soon! Hope that will make sense<br/>2. Diffs - have it in my mind for sure - side-by-side flows (or overlay), with indications for removed/added/changed. I'm not sure how to do it yet, but I'm sure it's possible<br/>3. Can't agree more! I'm planning on doing something similar to this <a href="http://xai-primer.com/tool/">http://xai-primer.com/tool/</a> for a while. Holding me back from doing it until everything else is done, but it's definitely on my short-term plans!
