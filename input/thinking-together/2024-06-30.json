Means, communities like this are not actually set up or trying to do something [together] about the problem, it just comes together to complain and lament (possibly because everybody has a different conflicting\/competing approach, wasting the time trying to convince everybody else, who have their own therefore won't drop theirs to join someone else's). FoC itself may not have, may not need, to have any projects or work groups of its own, it's just an open conversation space where people can dump\/promote what they're doing on their own. To actually seriously try to work on some better future of coding\/software, this is a rather unlikely place per setup\/goal, and likely a different community with a different setup\/goal should be found or created, if there were a need\/interest + capacity to work on this topic.\n\nI'm puzzled how there can be confusion about Christopher Alexander (CA here). He's an architect. Architects make patterns\/blueprints (templates, class definitions). A builder or fellow architect can use these to produce\/generate houses (object, instance or similar, following the architectural structures). The result is supposed to lead to certain properties and benefits. CA (as others) made a contribution and maintained a claim that his is somewhat more \"healthy\", more beneficial, than other such templates (consider brutalism, Le Corbusier modernism, which is a pattern of industrial mass production while on the other hand helps with hygiene, affordable housing, modularity, etc.). Critiquing CA to be overly dogmatic and insistent, that might not be too different from insisting that everything should be OOP, functional or imperative (be advised these are not architectures), or everything should be microservices (this one may be a single architectural pattern\/style). CA did not do this, but made the case\/point that if a more \"healthy\"\/\"regenerative\"\/nurturing architectural style\/approach is ignored\/rejected, you're stuck with houses that are not produced to be healthy for the human inhabitants (resulting in humans being less healthy, for no particular good reason). In this way, today's industrial production of houses (with no architecture or poor or unhealthy one) is seen as unfortunate, not great that it's dominant for profit reasons (cheap to make, health costs and damages externalized). So CA is about proposing and demonstrating + implementing an alternative model, which avoids and replaces the negative\/unhealthy aspects produced by the majority of today's built environment. \"Healthy\" here not in an abstract sense, but in a very practical sense of un-social setup, leading to depression, discomfort, etc., these being scientifically measurable\/measured. Like, the contrast between Le Corbusier's architecture for the health of the inhabitants and Alexander's is that the former's is mostly hygienic (scientific), while the latter's is \"wholistic\" by taking psychology, natural environment, etc. into account as well. Like, it shouldn't be too hard to see that Le Corbusier's has a certain lack of care for the focus on just the individual dweller(s) within their flat, and while there's shared rooms and public spaces and what not, these are primarily there as an \"operational necessity\" (my phrasing), you nominally give everybody minimal living space and a public shared space, but the actual priority is to industrially build lots of these to house many people, and how these interact together to form an environment is not of much interest, similar to the urban planning. If I'm not mistaken. So these architectures serve rather different purposes\/goals, and therefore per their design generate different outcomes. May not be apparent or visible to regular people who are not architects. Users just suffer the damages and have to pay the price (for the enrichment of the builder), not really understanding why they're miserable, as the environment is seen as inevitable, natural and a given. But architects know it's just made up by someone for some goal, and it can, sometimes, should (ought) to be different. So OK can say it's the capitalist incentive to screw over the inhabitants to rob them for personal profit and the law of the market demands it, but then no need to complain if accepting this to be inevitable or futile to try to change to some better alternatives. Same with software architecture. Then too no coincidence Kay's pyramid vs. gothic cathedral, roman arches, etc.\n\n\"Architect\", in case it remains an unknown notion in software, is an \"arch technician [engineer]\". Not necessarily a master craftsman who is very good at stacking blocks onto each other, but someone who also knows how to use\/apply physics to support structures that are several orders of magnitude more beneficial (both cost-effective and in use like enabling the aqueduct, eventually even trains can go over one). Is occupied with questions of what and how to build, or if at all, vs. what not to, and what impacts and properties the result will generate.",

CA (as others) made a contribution and maintained a claim that his is somewhat more \"healthy\", more beneficial, than other such templates (consider brutalism, Le Corbusier modernism, which is a pattern of industrial mass production while on the other hand helps with hygiene, affordable housing, modularity, etc.). Critiquing CA to be overly dogmatic and insistent, that might not be too different from insisting that everything should be OOP, functional or imperative (be advised these are not architectures), or everything should be microservices (this one may be a single architectural pattern\/style). CA did not do this, but made the case\/point that if a more \"healthy\"\/\"regenerative\"\/nurturing architectural style\/approach is ignored\/rejected, you're stuck with houses that are not produced to be healthy for the human inhabitants (resulting in humans being less healthy, for no particular good reason). In this way, today's industrial production of houses (with no architecture or poor or unhealthy one) is seen as unfortunate, not great that it's dominant for profit reasons (cheap to make, health costs and damages externalized). So CA is about proposing and demonstrating + implementing an alternative model, which avoids and replaces the negative\/unhealthy aspects produced by the majority of today's built environment. \"Healthy\" here not in an abstract sense, but in a very practical sense of un-social setup, leading to depression, discomfort, etc., these being scientifically measurable\/measured. Like, the contrast between Le Corbusier's architecture for the health of the inhabitants and Alexander's is that the former's is mostly hygienic (scientific), while the latter's is \"wholistic\" by taking psychology, natural environment, etc. into account as well. Like, it shouldn't be too hard to see that Le Corbusier's has a certain lack of care for the focus on just the individual dweller(s) within their flat, and while there's shared rooms and public spaces and what not, these are primarily there as an \"operational necessity\" (my phrasing), you nominally give everybody minimal living space and a public shared space, but the actual priority is to industrially build lots of these to house many people, and how these interact together to form an environment is not of much interest, similar to the urban planning. If I'm not mistaken. So these architectures serve rather different purposes\/goals, and therefore per their design generate different outcomes. May not be apparent or visible to regular people who are not architects. Users just suffer the damages and have to pay the price (for the enrichment of the builder), not really understanding why they're miserable, as the environment is seen as inevitable, natural and a given. But architects know it's just made up by someone for some goal, and it can, sometimes, should (ought) to be different. So OK can say it's the capitalist incentive to screw over the inhabitants to rob them for personal profit and the law of the market demands it, but then no need to complain if accepting this to be inevitable or futile to try to change to some better alternatives. Same with software architecture. Then too no coincidence Kay's pyramid vs. gothic cathedral, roman arches, etc.\n\n\"Architect\", in case it remains an unknown notion in software, is an \"arch technician [engineer]\". Not necessarily a master craftsman who is very good at stacking blocks onto each other, but someone who also knows how to use\/apply physics to support structures that are several orders of magnitude more beneficial (both cost-effective and in use like enabling the aqueduct, eventually even trains can go over one). Is occupied with questions of what and how to build, or if at all, vs. what not to, and what impacts and properties the result will generate."
