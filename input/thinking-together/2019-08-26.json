In languages where you don't define the latter, a default mapping is provided for you. Unfortunately this may not always be optimal. To take a simple example, objects are always stored as references in Python so a string attribute is a pointer to a string object. Strings are immutable so I should be able to *easily* say, for this class, store this attribute inline (i.e. embedded). So whenever you assign 'obj.strvalue = something', it would get copied (no refcount update). In Python you can write a custom C extension that does this, but it's too much work and not available within Python itself. C++ has copy constructors but they only work very isolated cases because the machine types (`char *` etc) are exposed and pervasive across APIs.\n\nThe motivation behind this is that I should be able to design with and write 'pure business logic' (for lack of a better word) without consideration of memory layouts and other lower level details, but also be able to specify these details separately. So if I change the memory layout, my business logic code doesn't have to change one bit. The business logic should only be coupled to the business shape. Consider how often in C++ a bunch of code will need to change if I switch from using a pointer to a reference. I also would like to do more advanced things, taking the Python example again, I may want to say that one attribute is always stored in a specific arena in memory. So whenever you assign to this attribute the value gets copied to the arena and aggregate operations on this attr become very fast. This would have to be baked into the language from the start - so `map` etc can be designed to be aware and use the internal structure of things. The ultimate extension of this idea is that you can take the same 'business logic' code and run it in a distributed fashion, but just providing a different implementation mapping.",

Consider how often in C++ a bunch of code will need to change if I switch from using a pointer to a reference. I also would like to do more advanced things, taking the Python example again, I may want to say that one attribute is always stored in a specific arena in memory. So whenever you assign to this attribute the value gets copied to the arena and aggregate operations on this attr become very fast. This would have to be baked into the language from the start - so "
