It also has a lot of examples of teams, leads and engineering managers removing embedded documentation because it doesn't fit standardized process.  I know the \"official\" FoC stance is to not care much about standard practice (hence the focus on hobby projects, non-programmers or \"less serious\" domains like education and games), but this demonstrates pretty clearly how common it is for people to have good ideas and useful tools that work for them, only to have corporate process\\machine cull them.",
