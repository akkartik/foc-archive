Hi everyone, long-time lurker here. I wanted to share a project I worked on for my PhD and hear your thoughts. It is a platform for quickly assembling web apps out of a new kind of software module we call a concept. Concepts are full-stack units of end-user functionality. For example, a comment concept manages the creation and display of comments, and a posting concept lets users create posts.<br/><br/>Each concept exports a set of components, which are similar to components in modern web frameworks like React. A key difference, however, is that concept components have an associated server-side action, which can be synchronized with other actions. In our platform, called Déjà Vu, a developer builds an app by including concepts and synchronizing the server-side actions of components. To assemble apps you only write JSON, HTML, and CSS—no server-side code or client-side JavaScript is required.<br/><br/>Webpage: <a href="https://deja-vu-platform.com">https://deja-vu-platform.com</a><br/>Paper: <a href="https://spderosso.github.io/onward19.pdf">https://spderosso.github.io/onward19.pdf</a><br/>Slides of the most recent talk: <a href="https://spderosso.github.io/slides/thesisdefense20.pdf">https://spderosso.github.io/slides/thesisdefense20.pdf</a><br/>Demo of the graphical environment (developed by Barry, a master student in our group): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10IexBI5v-A&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10IexBI5v-A&amp;feature=youtu.be</a><br/><br/>If you have any feedback, let me know.

An unusual effort. Apparently you created new HTML tags. And they have semantics. What i don't see anywhere which baffles me is your data structuring. Programs = Algorithms + data structures according to Prof. Wirth, and where are the data structures? What are the primitive types of your system? If there are no data structures, then how would you do a tic tac toe game for example, where you track the mutable state of the game as it progresses?  Or do you intend the game to be a custom module. JSON is a highly limiting data storage format, it only has boolean, string, and numeric data, and meta data is quite awkward to embed.<br/><br/>I did like that you had students build little test apps.

if a component acts as a data structure, how would component B access the contents of component A's data structures? If you only have JSON, how does one import a sound or bitmap? are you using explicit RAM pointers like JS? If so how do you then serialize your data for transport over the net? How does one introspect the contents of a component? If you have no meta data structuring, then each component author may adopt a different protocol. The devil is in the details as they say.

It’s not clear to me <b>who</b> this is for and <b>what</b> problem are you solving? You mention concepts like objects, id, inputs, outputs,, events, components, classes, and properties which are pretty strong terms — all requiring explanation of domain and constraints. The foundation of the UX is also quite complex which will turn-away most people.<br/><br/>Additionally, the problem you are solving is not clear. Instead of comparing to other apps (which I think is not a good approach) I rather ask what specific problem this is solving? Internal or external tools? What department?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@magicmouse94937</span>   To answer your question about the tic-tac-toe game, we would expect that to be a separate concept. The goal of Déjà Vu is not to be a general-purpose programming system, and it will not be well-suited for some types of web applications like games. That said, in our HTML extension, you can write expressions for the input/output bindings between components, and we have some concepts like “Property”, which are quite generic and can be configured to support different use cases.

For example, a basic Yelp clone for your community, or a social app for planning events on campus, etc. The audience is people that know HTML/CSS (if they want to use our language and get absolute control of the layout/styling of the page) or people that don’t necessarily know how to code, which is what the graphical environment is for.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Peak</span> to add a bit more on the question about who is this for: today you have many people using CMSs like WordPress/Drupal to build medium-complexity apps that go beyond a regular blog.  You can do a lot with plug-ins in CMSs, but plug-ins lack a generic composition mechanism, so composing them often requires a lot very complicated glue code. In Déjà Vu, our plug-ins (the concepts) can be combined together more easily through the declarative synchronization of the server-side actions of components. Essentially what we did is build a generic composition mechanism for plug-ins.

HTML/CSS is coding though. It may be the basics, but it’s certainly already in the realm of complexity that most people don’t know and may have learned out of necessity. Figma, Notion, Fibery, Airtable, and several other nocode platforms that already exist today feel more appropriate for these types of use cases. They may not fit perfectly, but that is not the point and the user won’t know that until they try various solutions.

&gt; Figma, Notion, Fibery, Airtable, and several other nocode platforms that already exist today feel more appropriate for these types of use cases<br/>You might be able to build some of these apps using no-code tools, but it’s more work than using Déjà Vu. If you use something like Bubble, for example, you have to write all the end-user behavior yourself (when a user clicks on this button, do this, etc) and if you use a plug-in like Discord for comments, you still need to write back-end triggers for things like when a new comment is created, do X, etc, to get the compound behavior you want. In Déjà Vu, you can get compound behavior by synchronizing server-side actions (you only put components inside a &lt;dv.tx&gt; tag).<br/><br/>For more about this, see section 1.2 of the paper:<br/><a href="https://spderosso.github.io/onward19.pdf">https://spderosso.github.io/onward19.pdf</a>

So, the idea is to structure the web application as set of pre-defined concepts?<br/>Then these concepts are composed together declaratively as a html tree data structure (coded by someone or generated by composer UI).<br/>And under the hood, there is something that coordinates the client-server communication (by handling eval/exec), with possible transaction like synchronization for certain events?<br/><br/>I did not fully understood the part about composing concepts.<br/>I think of concept as a "process" (that runs on frontend/backend) with eval and exec operations. So if I have two concepts, how can I combine them?<br/><br/>Will it mean that for combined concept conceptC I will get the conceptA.UI and conceptB.UI somewhere in the UI of combined concept. And both data from conceptA and conceptB will available on eval step (like in a graphql query). And for the exec step — the A.exec and then B.exec will be executed in some order?

i like this. it seems like you might want a fuzzy search over a lot of the lists in the app just as a ux note. but particularly it’s nice to see apps in this space being used relatively rapidly instead of at a snails pace. when i’m using eg airtable i often find myself knocked out of my flow state by like 67 different dialog boxes

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andrew Sernyak</span><br/>&gt; So, the idea is to structure the web application as set of pre-defined concepts?<br/>&gt; Then these concepts are composed together declaratively as a html tree data structure (coded by someone or generated by composer UI).<br/>&gt; And under the hood, there is something that coordinates the client-server communication (by handling eval/exec), with possible transaction like synchronization for certain events?<br/>Yes, that is correct.<br/><br/>&gt; I think of concept as a “process” (that runs on frontend/backend) with eval and exec operations. <br/>Yes, that’s good. Note that a concept can have multiple eval/exec operations (one set of eval/exec per concept component)<br/><br/>&gt; So if I have two concepts, how can I combine them?<br/>For example, let’s say you have a book review app and you’d like to allow your users to input book reviews with a comment and a star rating. So, you create a review component and include the <tt>create-comment</tt> component of the <tt>comment</tt> concept and the <tt>rate-target</tt> component of the <tt>rating</tt> concept:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">...<br/>&lt;comment.create-comment /&gt;<br/>&lt;rating.rate-target /&gt;<br/>...</pre><br/>At this point, your users can create a review comment and a rating separately, but we want to compose them and have the exec run together, so we do two things: (1) we wrap them with a <tt>dv.tx</tt>; and (2) we wire a generated  unique ID to both concept components so that the entities they eventually save (the rating and comment) are linked by the shared ID:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">...<br/>&lt;dv.tx&gt;<br/>  &lt;dv.gen-id /&gt;<br/>  &lt;comment.create-comment id=dv.gen-id.id targetId=$postId /&gt;<br/>  &lt;rating.rate-target targetId=dv.gen-id.id /&gt;<br/>  &lt;dv.button /&gt;<br/>&lt;/dv.tx&gt;<br/>...</pre><br/> When the user clicks on the <tt>dv.button</tt>, both the <tt>exec</tt> of <tt>create-comment</tt>  and the <tt>exec</tt> of <tt>rate-target</tt> run together at the same time.

Much like Edward, I was confused about the data model after seeing the video. There's "objects" and there's "events" and they are tied together... somehow, and in one view a GUID appears but in another it does not appear for some reason. The data schema is important; your thingie is not user-friendly unless users can see data and schema more directly - and do things with it, such as rearrange it to correct mistakes in the schema and data.<br/><br/>Earlier I remember seeing a really nice spreadsheet-like editor for databases, I think it's on this slack somewhere. It wasn't super pretty (because it's designed to look like a boring old spreadsheet) but it supported all of SQL-92 + extras entirely in a visual manner. Users didn't have to construct a user interface, they could just deal with the data (and views and calculated columns) directly. A thing like this for constructing user interfaces could be a great value-add <b>on top of</b> something like that.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Don Abrams</span><br/><br/>&gt; There a another slack community called “no code founders” that this would be a great fit for feedback from. Several platforms have tried similar approaches.<br/>Thanks for the tip, I’ll check it out. However, the plan for the project is not to be a startup. The project is a research project to explore new approaches to building applications. The tool is open-source (MIT license) and I have no plans to develop it commercially.<br/><br/>&gt; I’ve done similar POC work to this, and seen it become equivalent to imperative coding but with one extra layer of indirection<br/>Could you share some links? I’d love to check it out. I should clarify that this is not a UI over standard coding. We created a new type of software module and a new way to put full-stack modules together declaratively. There are more details on the linked paper.<br/><br/>Perhaps sharing the demo video with the graphical environment was a mistake because people just think “oh this is another <a href="http://bubble.io">bubble.io</a>”, but it’s not. The goal is not to build a graphical environment on top of traditional programming, the goal is to build a new style of programming. We just build the graphical environment for people that might not want to use our HTML extension language and to help build apps faster.

A thing like this for constructing user interfaces could be a great value-add <b>on top of</b> something like that.<br/>In our project we assume concepts (our modules) are given and we focused our efforts on figuring out a way to compose concepts together easily.  In our current prototype you implement concepts using standard web programming tools (TypeScript, GraphQL, etc)---we didn’t try to innovate there. I agree that something like what you suggest (a spreadsheet-like editor for databases) would be a good way for people to build concepts, which can then be composed with other concepts in our tool.

Err... re-reading this thread, I think I should make it clear that I was NOT suggesting a spreadsheet-like editor as a way of building concepts. I was saying that the editor presented in the video is confusing, and that a separate, predictable way of visualizing the data store wold help ameliorate that problem. For example, any time the user sees data that looks somehow "wrong", the user needs to be able to figure out whether it is wrong because (A) the data is actually wrong in the database or (B) a concept is misconfigured or something else, like, they're looking at a different record than they thought they were. If the database is invisible, the user will have a harder time understanding what's going on.
