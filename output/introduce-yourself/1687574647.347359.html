Hi all! I'm based in Melbourne and am about a year into being 'proper' software developer and occasional designer. I currently work on an application for making timelines.<br/><br/>Before that, I was an academic developing/teaching CAD tools for landscape architects, where I spent a lot of time in a visual programming environment (Grasshopper) and also explored some tangible-table style tools for landform design/simulation. My doctorate was exploring how to design CAD tools that could model natural systems by privileging change-over-time, rather than geometry, as the means of composing design ideas.<br/><br/>I originally came to the FoC podcast when I was slightly obsessed with Orca, although I've mostly shifted over to Teletype for live-coding music. I enjoy the show's recent focus on key comp sci papers and love its approach to audio editing!
