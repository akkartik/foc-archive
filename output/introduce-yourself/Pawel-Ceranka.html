<b>Hello everyone!</b> :wave:<br/><br/>First let me address the important things in life :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: :<br/>• programming language of choice: <em>Clojure</em><br/>• editor: <em>Emacs</em><br/>Current status:<br/>• co-organising <a href="http://reclojure.org">reclojure.org</a> conference (used to be in London, now on-line, free, and happening next week, everyone’s invited!)<br/>• building <b>Nette: Research OS for the Web</b> (I’m very, very open to a less cheesy tagline)<br/><em><b>Nette</b></em> is something that I’ve always wanted for myself.<br/>Way to gather all kinds of diverse types of media (tweet is a medium) on a visual canvas which is also an information system<br/>-- with each gesture of the UI evolving the system and being remembered.<br/><br/>It’s focused on expressiveness and agency over information. And eventually being collaborative and programmable.<br/>More about powerful ways of seeing/understanding and “doing with information”, rather than producing artifacts.<br/><br/>The only things that’s public atm is this cheeky teaser, doesn’t explain much, but I’m happy to give a demo to anyone who wants to listen and give feedback…<br/><br/> <a href="https://vimeo.com/640304817/13aaa16679">https://vimeo.com/640304817/13aaa16679</a><br/><br/>Looking forward to hanging out more around here. I would really appreciate any feedback whatsoever :heart:<br/>Thanks!
