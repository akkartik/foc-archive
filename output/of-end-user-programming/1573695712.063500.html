one thing i think could be fruitful is to look up a class of products people use spreadsheets for—eg, take personal finance. and then ask “why don’t people do this unless they’re really super comfortable with spreadsheets?” like i really should have a personal budget in an excel document but both the interface and automation seem really lacking. not to say: make mint or truebill, but “if i were to make a flexible, semi-automated mint, what primitives would fall out for data entry, visualization, manipulation” etc
