        "text": "<@UCGAK10LS> right now the focus is on developing appropriate theoretical frameworks for reasoning about representations. This is the main focus for now because the research is (very informally) aiming to help us communicate with each other and ourselves. It aims to assist existing reasoning about digital systems and facilitate cross-domain interoperability. Less knowledge rediscovery, more reuse. By digital system I’m speaking quite generally (Slack, your desktop, filesystems, OSs, drop down menus, network infrastructure. These are all digital systems in this context)\n\nI’m referring to _representation in_ the _knowledge representation_ sense, not the concept in the arts, and also not the way in which someone like Bret Victor uses the term, which is less defined. Unlike most knowledge representation literature I’m coming from a systems science perspective, which quickly leads to a single notion of representation breaking down, and the ‘system’ part becoming more central, so I often use the term ‘representation systems’ to differentiate this systems-based understanding of representations from the KR one.\n\nLots of KR literature comes from logic systems so there’s a lot of work on specific encodings of logic. There’s not as much work on large scale KR systems with many coexisting representations.\n\nExamples of representation systems might include (digital\/plain) text, IPFS addressing, interchange formats, or a programming language. With digital text being nearly omnipresent.\n\nedit: this was still full of jargon, I’ll try and give you a better answer in the future.",

Unlike most knowledge representation literature I’m coming from a systems science perspective, which quickly leads to a single notion of representation breaking down, and the ‘system’ part becoming more central, so I often use the term ‘representation systems’ to differentiate this systems-based understanding of representations from the KR one.\n\nLots of KR literature comes from logic systems so there’s a lot of work on specific encodings of logic. There’s not as much work on large scale KR systems with many coexisting representations.\n\nExamples of representation systems might include (digital\/plain) text, IPFS addressing, interchange formats, or a programming language. With digital text being nearly omnipresent.\n\nedit: this was still full of jargon, I’ll try and give you a better answer in the future."
