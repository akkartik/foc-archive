I'm Josh, a software engineer in Marin (the sleepy, boring part of the Bay Area).\n\nI've worked on a variety of things over my 15ish years, including computer vision and (very early) deep learning, the Go compiler and standard library, and secure networking. One of the few threads running through my career is an abiding interest in how developers work and in building things for developers.\n\nI'm particularly interested in faster feedback loops, better input mechanisms, power tools, version control, and (recently) how this little AI kerfuffle will play out past co-pilots. I really like weird and experimental stuff, and don't get enough of it in my current life.\n\nI'm here courtesy of <@U0602GYQYJW>; his description of the demos at a recent London meetup sounded like just my cup of tea. I'm at a career crossroads, so I'm also secretly hoping for a bit of serendipity or inspiration :shushing_face:.",

I'm Josh, a software engineer in Marin (the sleepy, boring part of the Bay Area).\n\nI've worked on a variety of things over my 15ish years, including computer vision and (very early) deep learning, the Go compiler and standard library, and secure networking. One of the few threads running through my career is an abiding interest in how developers work and in building things for developers.\n\nI'm particularly interested in faster feedback loops, better input mechanisms, power tools, version control, and (recently) how this little AI kerfuffle will play out past co-pilots. I really like weird and experimental stuff, and don't get enough of it in my current life.\n\nI'm here courtesy of "
