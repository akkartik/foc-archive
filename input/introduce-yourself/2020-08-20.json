Years ago, I built this prototype for a live-coding environment. I like what Scratch and Snap! are doing to make programming more accessible. And of course, I dream of futuristic ironman-style coding environments to build systems. My current project is <https:\/\/learnawesome.org> which is an attempt to built Google Maps for learning. Hoping to learn a lot from all of you.",
