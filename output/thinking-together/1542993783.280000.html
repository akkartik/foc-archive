It's hard to not go meta on this… :-)<br/><br/>I wasn’t aware of the term <em>composition</em> used in writing.<br/>Not sure if the analogy is very useful or terribly important to make.<br/><br/>The main question is: What are you optimizing for? <br/>Let's throw yet another analogy in: Are you an architect building a house to serve your client's need for shelter, or are you trying to create a beautiful piece of art that will hopefully become an iconic part of your city's skyline?<br/><br/>You can’t argue that there's no difference between the two. It's important that you know which game you’re playing to have the impact you want.

Thinking about this a little more:<br/><br/>As with all things that come disguised as simple black/white matters (which is just a way for humans to optimize for effective communication), reality is almost always more complex and more like a spectrum.<br/><br/>For all three domains (writing, architecture, and programming) a little knowledge of the other extreme on the spectrum you’re not currently optimizing for can go a long way in helping you achieve a better outcome.

Couple of citations:<br/><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Buildings_Learn">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Buildings_Learn</a> is a thinly veiled case for favoring function over aesthetics.<br/><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_on_the_Synthesis_of_Form">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_on_the_Synthesis_of_Form</a> tries to derive the ideal form given a function. Its key insight is to express the function not as a set of requirements that a building should obey, but as a set of <em>misfits</em> that the building should <em>avoid</em>.<br/><br/>I'm very influenced by these two books, and so I tend to be anti-aesthetic. Until, that is, somebody can tell me the reason for the aesthetic. A <em>concrete</em> reason in the current situation. Over time I have also tended to grow anti-meta and anti-analogy. These two books are all the analogy a programmer needs. They're far better developed than anything we're likely to think up.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> I can totally see your point and value function over form and yet I can’t describe myself as “anti-aesthetic”. Mostly because I believe aesthetic can be a shortcut to describe something (functionally) useful without fully understanding why it is useful. Well, I subscribe to Steve Jobs’ “Design is how it works” definition of design too, so that might be important context. And as far as I can understand, that excludes all the cases where aesthetics don’t serve a higher purpose and have a contribution to form or usefulness.<br/><br/>I guess what I’m saying is that as humans I hope were somehow wired to perceive greatness through aesthetics as a shortcut. But then just looking at the design of many products on the market it’s clearly a skill that is not evenly distributed…

Totally. But it's worth remembering that it's just a heuristic. It's often misleading, particularly when arrived at by analogy with other fields. Worth remembering that there's never been anything quite like programming.<br/><br/>We're often building things for lots of people, that may last a long time. Shortcuts need to be expanded in that situation.

Oh, about the “analogy” part I’d like to recommend the book I’m reading right now: <br/><em>Metaphors We Live By</em> by George Lakoff (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34459.Metaphors_We_Live_By">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34459.Metaphors_We_Live_By</a>)<br/><br/>It makes a (pretty compelling) case that we structure all our thinking by metaphors and basically all understanding is enabled by it.

Oh I have no disagreement there.

<em>/me clones the repo</em><br/><br/>But to finish my comment, even if it's human nature to reason by analogy it's worth asking if programmers should go with or against the flow there.

:slightly_smiling_face: True. I'd like all people programming. It's worth expanding all heuristics in general. But my meta-heuristic is to mistrust aesthetics <em>when programming in particular</em>.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Daniel Garcia</span> to answer your question, I like the analogy in your post. It's kinda similar to (though not subsumed by or isomorphic to) one I've been making for a couple of years:<br/><br/>Programming literacy is about being able to reason critically about an arbitrary program, and about being able to compare and contrast two programs (functions) that do similar things.<br/><br/>This analogy seems to work in a couple of ways:<br/><br/>We often learn to read by practicing writing. But that's just part of the process. <em>What</em> you have written is irrelevant by the time you gain literacy.<br/><br/>I'd like to live in a world where most people are literate by this definition. They can't write an OS (novel), but they do <em>read</em> OSs every once in a while when they need to. (Unfortunately, I think <em>nobody</em> is literate by this definition today. All some of us programmer-priests can do easily is read programs we ourselves wrote. Not too long ago. It's because we're writing in the equivalent of Roman numerals, and then struggling to read it back, tongues sticking out.)<br/><br/>_(This builds on my earlier comment at <a href="https://futureprogramming.slack.com/archives/C5U3SEW6A/p1542223799068500?thread_ts=1542220667.062400.">https://futureprogramming.slack.com/archives/C5U3SEW6A/p1542&hellip;</a>)_

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> One addendum on analogies: analogies are great for quickly painting a picture to someone who's utterly new to something. Giving an analogy for programming to a non-programmer is useful, because it can get a lot communicated very quickly. If it's misleading in a few places that's fine. We can elaborate if we need to.<br/><br/>However, I've found analogies to be poor ways to try to persuade people of something opposite their own beliefs. I've tried to justify the direction I take in my research by making analogies with past historical events, movements, etc. And they've all uniformly bombed.<br/><br/>This may be obvious, but it took me a certain amount of head-butting to realize..
