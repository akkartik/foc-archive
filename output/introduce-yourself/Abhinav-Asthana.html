Hello everyone, I am the founder of Postman (<a href="http://www.getpostman.com">www.getpostman.com</a>). I built Postman as a side-project and thanks to the support of the dev community has grown to become a powerful tool used by more than 5 million people. I am super passionate about development easier, faster, and more accessible to everyone. I came across <a href="http://futureofcoding.org">futureofcoding.org</a> recently and thought itâ€™d be great to join the community and learn more from everyone. We have several challenges in meeting the needs of devs (new and expert) and I am always curious about new ideas!
