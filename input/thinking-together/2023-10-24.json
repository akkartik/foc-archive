                "text": "A Usenet newsgroup is a repository usually within the Usenet system, for messages posted from users in different locations using the Internet. They are discussion groups and are not devoted to publishing news. Newsgroups are technically distinct from, but functionally similar to, discussion forums on the World Wide Web. Newsreader software is used to read the content of newsgroups.\nBefore the adoption of the World Wide Web, Usenet newsgroups were among the most popular Internet services.\nCommunication is facilitated by the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) which allows connection to Usenet servers and data transfer over the internet.  Similar to another early (yet still used) protocol SMTP which is used for email messages, NNTP allows both server-server and client-server communication.  This means that newsgroups can be replicated from server to server which gives the Usenet network the ability to maintain a level of robust data persistence as a result of built-in data redundancy.  However, most users will access using only the client-server commands of NNTP and in almost all cases will use a GUI for browsing as opposed to command line based client-server communication specified in the NNTP protocol.",

Why not bake it into the standard? Why not have a standard for how to implement accessible rendering of an element like they do for browsers, instead most accessibility tech (even the stuff baked into browsers a lot of the time) mostly function as a black box.

Why not bake it into the standard? Why not have a standard for how to implement accessible rendering of an element like they do for browsers, instead most accessibility tech (even the stuff baked into browsers a lot of the time) mostly function as a black box. It is hard to tell what they do and why"

An approach that suits one part of the program, or one time in its development, may be confounding at another, but the user is stuck with both the constructive and obstructive aspects of a tool&amp;rsquo;s chosen paradigm throughout. Much of this difficulty can be removed by enabling the cohabitation of multiple editing paradigms in a single program for the user to choose how to tackle the current point in the process - and change their mind. We present a new data-flow programming environment where the same program, or parts of the same program, can be viewed and edited as linear text, a node-and-wire graph representation, or a two-dimensional grid layout, and the correspondence between these representations is made clear through a continuous visual identity for each part of the program.",

So far it doesn't seem to come up in the discussions on the podcast but I think there is something to be said about the advancement in a11y in computing over the last 25 years and a large part of this is due to a movement away from some of the more creative interface designs (ala Magic Ink). Is there a future of code that is more accessible to people with different abilities?",
