Let me add some nuance so you can see where I'm coming from as well:\n\n&gt; Personally, for my own goal of programming for non-techies,\n\nI have a similar goal, but while I used to be concerned with someone's *first few experiences* of programming, I am now not so worried if they need to spend a reasonable amount of time (similar the amount of time people spend to learn Excel) to get up to speed. I am now more concerned with the problem of *normal people wanting to make small changes to large app that the use in a reasonable amount of time* (which will take longer if they are not yet used to programming at all or in this new system).\n\n&gt; The real world\n\nThe is a common strategy, trying to argue that a language feature or paradigm is \"closer to reality\" somehow. For example, Alan Kay talks about how objects are great because they are like biological cells and cells are able to create great complexity, emerging from simple parts. That convinced me in the past, but I am now skeptical of those claims, because \"like reality\" is not an end in and of itself. The goal, I believe, is the *comprehensibility of large systems* and nature seems to resist comprehension, or at least be quite difficult to comprehend, a la quantum mechanics.\n\n&gt; has state,\n\nThere are a few different ways to handle state in FP. My preferred way is the original FRP, now called DCTP (denotative continuous time programming). I think it's truly beautiful,  but it also took me months to fully grasp, so it's hard to communicate why.\n\nHere's one way to understand it: it's like directly plopping the equations from your physics textbook into your text editor and then you have gravity. It's like math. No IO Monad required.\n\n&gt;  visible everywhere,\n\nFirstly, state in the \"real world\" is not visible everywhere... unless you're some sort of superhero with x-ray vision... if so, that's a different discussion... :wink:\n\nSecondly, *composibiliy* is a really important property, and it's hindered by global state.\n\n&gt; and real \"types\" are in the eye of the beholder.\n\nThis is a fascinating claim. Types are a really difficult thing to pin down and define. In my head, they've always had to do with the *shape* of some data. I have an essay on it, here. <https:\/\/medium.com\/@stevekrouse\/types-are-shapes-d6af1e83192f>\n\nIf we use this metaphor to think through what you said, I think you would be incorrect because shapes are objective in reality. You simply cannot fit a round peg into a square hole.\n\nI guess you could say that \"round\" and \"square\" are human-defined concepts... but if you want different concepts I guess you could make your own types and type classes",

I currently am working on making a Haskell-like language feel very fluid.\n\nHere's the vision: instead of telling you when you're *wrong*, types should be aids that help you \"figure out what's possible*. To get a physical sense of what I mean, imagine a toy kit with toys of different shapes and being able to feel with your hands which toys can go where based on their shapes and how they slide into one and other - or get jammed.\n\n&gt; to the *model* of IO that Haskell makes available.\n\nThe IO monad is not truly Haskell, where I'm defining *true Haskell* to be a \"denotative\" language. Original FRP (DCTP) is. Or at least it's much closer.

I'm up for that challenge!\n\n\n&gt; \"like reality\" is not an end in and of itself.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, \"like reality\" is absolutely what this is about: \"programming is casting spells over reality\", even if that reality is generated by machines. It's about the perception of the person doing the programming being met well enough.\n\n\n&gt; The goal, I believe, is the *comprehensibility of large systems* and nature seems to resist comprehension\n\nWith good structuring, you can comprehend a large system by looking only at a small subsystem. And you only need to comprehend the nature you care about to the degree it's useful.\n\n\n&gt; There are a few different ways to handle state in FP. My preferred way is the original FRP, now called DCTP (denotative continuous time programming). I think it's truly beautiful,  but it also took me months to fully grasp, so it's hard to communicate why.\n\nI think \"in FP\" is the problem: you need to give state a first class status, then add FP! I don't like streams or event streams or anything that forces natural models of reality into a theoretical straitjacket. My mother doesn't see a stream of events around her: she sees changing state!\n\n\n&gt; state in the \"real world\" is not visible everywhere\n\nMy mother would disagree - everywhere she looks and walks is a whole bunch of state that was there yesterday and will probably be there tomorrow, with a few changes perhaps..\n\n\n&gt; It's like math. No IO Monad required.\n\nI agree that \"No IO Monad required\" is an excellent goal! As is being well-ordered like mathematical abstractions.\n\n\n&gt; *composability* is a really important property, and it's hindered by global state.\n\nNot if you structure your global state - the web is composed very well, thanks!\n\n\n\n&gt; Types are a really difficult thing to pin down and define. In my head, they've always had to do with the *shape* of some data. I have an essay on it.. If we use this metaphor to think through what you said, I think you would be incorrect because shapes are objective in reality. You simply cannot fit a round peg into a square hole.  I guess you could say that \"round\" and \"square\" are human-defined concepts... but if you want different concepts I guess you could make your own types and type classes\n\nI'm in the duck typing camp: if you can hit a small glass bottle into the round hole using a square peg as a hammer, you're good to go..\n\nI think shape===type, too, in fact: if I see some data shape as this type and you see that shape as that type, who cares?",

Think about having wikipedia-like editing right within your documentation. Especially if I'm new to a project, I'm always afraid to screw up other people's documentation by writing something stupid. I wonder if knowing that the next regular guy who reads my changes could easily improve or correct them would lower the bar to start collaborating.\nAnother option could be to include comments into each documentation page. People are used to providing feedback if they can, so they would probably point out a lot of issues that could then be used by maintainers to improve documentation.\nUsing current tools (IRC, github issues \/ PRs) all of this is possible already, but I think that making it easier and integrating it better into the documentation itself could make a huge difference.",

Really amazing to finally chat! <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DuMdDXCMDk0>\n\nFor reference on what we talked about, here are the notes I took from the convo:\n```\n* first computer experience when he was 18\n* studying engineering in India in college\n* before he found computers, he was going to do MBA and be business guy\n* UT Austin PhD in computer systems (compiler and micro architecture)\n  * wanted to re-think *all* the assumptions from the ground up based on what we know about compilers\n  * as well as the other direction, redesigning compilers based on ISA architectures\n  * it was all very theoretical because nobody was going to use it, because backwards-compatibility has force. who's going to invest in a new processor?\n  * we're in a x86-mono culture\n* and then Bay area ever since\n* my idea of convervatism is don't change things because we don't know why they work: Chesterton's fence.

It's about the perception of the person doing the programming being met well enough.\n\nIt's a two-sided problem as described in this Bret Victor photo: <http:\/\/worrydream.com\/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign\/Images\/Tool2.png>\n\nI'm arguing that the \"part that fits the person\" doesn't need to be that closely related to the \"part that fits the problem\". We have some flexibility here.\n\n&gt; I don't like streams or event streams or anything that forces natural models of reality into a theoretical straitjacket. My mother doesn't see a stream of events around her: she sees changing state!\n\nYour mother also doesn't see the equations for the laws of physics but they are the best way to *model* reality (that we have discovered so far). They are the best tool for the job for understanding and predicting reality. That's the key -- not to simply defer to what people already have in their brains but to build a powerful tool to extend their capabilities, which will require them to grow what's in their brains to meet the \"tool\" halfway.\n\n&gt;&gt; state in the \"real world\" is not visible everywhere\n\n&gt; My mother would disagree - everywhere she looks and walks is a whole bunch of state that was there yesterday and will probably be there tomorrow, with a few changes perhaps..\n\nThere's a ton of state that is hidden to us all. For example, the other night I felt like I was getting sick. I didn't know. It was all hidden inside me. Turns out it was just a blip. I have no idea why. Reality is quite opaque for a lot of questions. Software has the potential to be *infinitely* understandable and *infinitely* customizable* - why settle for the meagerness of reality?\n\n&gt;&gt; *composability* is a really important property, and it's hindered by global state.\n\n&gt; Not if you structure your global state - the web is composed very well, thanks!\n\nThis is only because the web as global state is just static pages. The web doesn't have dynamic global state, where one web page can modify another page's state. That's maintained by ugly HTTP plumbing code on the side.",
