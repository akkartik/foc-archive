Hi everyone! I am Gleb, by day an engineer at Coda, by night working on my chrome extension <a href="https://ampie.app">ampie.app</a> which shows twitter &amp; HN discussions for the page you are on (written in Clojure and Clojurescript, the extension is <a href="https://github.com/posobin/ampie">open-source</a>). In the past I was pursuing a PhD in theoretical CS at Columbia but dropped out a year ago. In the past couple of months I have been thinking about creating a new programming language together with an environment, but my thoughts on it are very rough and it seems like a daunting project. I have been aware of the FoC community probably for a year or two now, decided to get more involved to see what people are working on and also post my own ideas/explorations at some point. Excited to be here!<br/><br/>Also, you can find me in NYC and on twitter, that's where I usually hang out: <a href="https://twitter.com/posobin">@posobin</a>.
