Hi folks! I wanted to share what I’ve been working on at Airtable  - a new way to build apps! Today, Airtable is kicking off the developer preview of Custom Blocks with a $100,000 developer contest. With Custom Blocks, we’re letting developers increase the power of Airtable by building highly composable components on top of our end-user-friendly real-time database.<br/><br/>Now you can spend 100% of your time focused on what makes your app unique and leave the rest to Airtable. The best part? Custom Blocks are built with Javascript and React. You can leverage npm’s 1,200,000+ modules to build almost anything you can imagine.<br/><br/>Get all the details: <a href="https://airtable.devpost.com">https://airtable.devpost.com</a>

That looks interesting. I hadn't gotten around to checking out Airtable yet, though I have some read-only access to it for my day job. I wonder if you could help me think through some preliminaries.<br/><br/>When I look at <a href="https://airtable.com/pricing">https://airtable.com/pricing</a> it sounds like these custom blocks will after some promotional period slot in at the $20/user/month "Pro" pricing level. Is that accurate? If so, it seems like it's geared towards enterprise usage rather than hobbyists (particularly since a single person may need multiple license 'seats' to collaborate in different spaces with different groups). Am I thinking about this the right way?<br/><br/>I don't intend this as criticism. We've had similar discussions in this group about our usage of Slack, now that we're starting to run up against the restrictions of the free tier. And my lesson from that experience is to be more thoughtful about whether I am in the target market before I adopt a new tool.
