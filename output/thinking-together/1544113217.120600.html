Not really ... I type much faster and much less ambiguously than I speak

Surely speaking is much faster than typing? I can never transcribe talks in real time and am always amazed by stenographers - I believe they even have to use special stenotype keyboards.<br/><br/>The ambiguity aspect is important. I think that depends more on the language design than on the input mechanism (speaking to program doesn't have to use plain English).<br/><br/>I feel exploring this space opens up many other aspects not related to speaking as well. E.g. programming could be more conversational (back and forth) rather than write-everything-up-and-submit dissertation style. Perhaps expressing some ambiguity and then resolving it becomes important.

speaking is faster, but that's because it's typically stream of consciousness instead of deliberate, clear thought. Given that coding currently requires the latter to be of much use, I suspect you'll find that speaking code would be very unnatural without a very different kind of programming system - one that we probably wouldn't even call programming.

I explored a little of this at microsoft, but the tech and theory aren't really there for it yet

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Shalabh</span> Agree on the last paragraph ... programming in dialogue with the system / in the order that's convenient for the programmer not the machine is one of the directions we should be exploring

what about in dialogue with another human? there’s the necessary goal of making a program unambiguous to the computer which is executing it, but peer programming is useful in finding assumptions or idiosyncrasies in code that I would not have thought about without another person. I’m imagining some situation where source code is written as a dialectic text – starting from the abstract, then delving into the specifics and edge cases, asking “why” and “how” against the abstract – questions that I often ask to my computer screen when reading someone else’s code. (then I imagine you’d need to make that unambiguous to a computer. I don’t know what that looks like.)
