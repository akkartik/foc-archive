From 2015 to 2016, Cummings was the  Campaign Director of Vote Leave, an organisation opposed to continued British membership of the European Union that took an active part in the 2016 referendum campaign on that issue. \nIn July 2019, the new Prime Minister Boris Johnson appointed him to the role of Special Adviser to the Prime Minister. As per procedure, Cummings temporarily resigned his role when Parliament dissolved for the election, along with most special advisers, but was briefly reinstated to assist the government during the Yorkshire Floods.",

        "text": "*Is the command line on the decline or rise?* Hear me out. Conventional wisdom is that the command line died when the Mac was introduced in 1984 and Microsoft followed suit shortly after with Windows. And I say that narrative is accurate if you're only looking at a time span of say 1984-1994. But over the course of my programming career, which spans from 2001-2019, over that time the relevance of the command line seems to be *increasing*. I'm guessing this stems from `git`, which was introduced in 2005, and once that was in place it laid the groundwork for package manager usage to explode, especially with `npm` being introduced in 2010. Once package managers were in place, that set the stage for an explosion of new CLI applications, such as linters and style formatters, which laid the foundation for the next generation of text editors to emerge, i.e., VS Code and Atom, some of whose core features are integration with these new CLI utilities. Tack onto that the increasingly sophisticated ways of managing development environments, such as version managers like `nvm`. So what do you think, is the command line on the rise or declining?",

                "text": "On a crisp morning in February 2013, Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings walked into David Cameron’s private office at 10 Downing Street. An anonymous Twitter account, @toryeducation, had been repeatedly attacking the prime minister. Cameron sat in his armchair. Cummings took the chair traditionally reserved for George Osborne, Cameron’s friend and chancellor. Gove sat to the side. The prime minister spoke first. He wasn’t after a confession, but peace. “Right, what’s going on? What’s the problem? Let’s talk.” There was a moment’s silence. Finally, Cummings spoke. “And Cummings the iconoclast, Cummings the guy who portrays himself as the uber-revolutionary, who speaks truth to power wherever he sees it…,” says a No 10 official from the time, “was meek as you can be.” He said very little, but praised Cameron for the great job he was doing and thanked him for the opportunity to work at the Department for Education (DfE). Then he and Gove left, to the bemusement of the prime minister. Cummings had initially been blocked from joining the department by Andy Coulson, Cameron’s head of communications. Coulson correctly believed Cummings would not take orders from N0 10. For the first nine months of the coalition government, Cummings was banished, but remained in Gove’s orbit, periodically coming into the office. Yet with no formal role, and no power to direct anyone, he was deeply frustrated. When the phone hacking scandal forced Coulson, a former editor of the News of the World, out in January 2011, Cummings was saved from political purgatory. He immediately joined the department as Gove’s de facto chief of staff, a role he held for the next three years. When in office, Cummings’s moods were variable. “Sometimes he was like a small kid, overexcited and jumping about, and sometimes he’d just sit in a corner and basically sulk,” says a former colleague. In James Graham’s Channel 4 drama, Brexit: The Uncivil War, Benedict Cumberbatch portrayed Cummings as unwaveringly even-keeled. In reality, “you never knew who you were going to get each day”, says a colleague. A dark cloud might hang over the office, or Cummings could perk up and be “great fun”. Dominic Cummings leaves his home in London on 2 September 2019​. Credit: Getty Gove and Cummings managed to run the DfE as an essentially autonomous wing of the government, much as Gordon Brown and Ed Balls had run an independent Treasury under Tony Blair. Though in charge of the team, Cummings had “no concept of normal working hours whatsoever”, I was told. He would come in whenever he wanted, sauntering in at 2pm without explanation. He would also sometimes stay late. He often worked hard, but on his own timetable. Another member of the office remembers his irascibility. “A lot of the time he would just simmer. You’d tiptoe past, hoping not to wake him. Then he’d get an email and be screaming at the screen, storming out of the office to find someone.” While he worked successfully with the few civil servants whose minds chimed with his, the co-worker thinks that “the atmosphere he created was one of fear”. When one official raised objections to a policy important to Cummings, they were swiftly moved out of the department. Cummings considered himself in a war with officials; he claims on his blog that one told him, “You’re a mutant virus, [and] I’m the immune system.” Steve Hilton, Cameron’s highest-profile adviser from that time, left government in frustration after two years. He tells me: “The attitude of the civil service was to try to exclude Dom and stop him from seeing papers.” Cummings governed through conflict. Chris Lockwood, then of the N0 10 Policy Unit, remembers him as being “awkward, abrupt, arrogant, aggressive, chronically late. He’d change a meeting [time], he wouldn’t turn up.” And yet his position in the department was unassailable, for a simple reason: Gove considered himself to be in Cummings’s lasting debt. “I could never disavow Dominic,” Gove once told a friend, “I owe him everything.” *** Gove and Cummings met 21 years ago, when Gove was a Times journalist and Cummings a young strategist, five years his junior but the more relevant political figure. Cummings, after a peripatetic spell in Russia as an unsuccessful airline entrepreneur, was on the verge of rising to prominence by running Business for Sterling, the campaign that helped dissuade Tony Blair from holding a referendum on Britain joining the single currency. Following this success, in January 2002 Cummings was picked by Iain Duncan Smith, newly elected as Tory leader, to be his director of strategy. He was 30. Within eight months, he was out: Cummings had made too many enemies. But during his brief tenure both he and Gove gave notice of their tactics. When David Davis, a thwarted party leadership rival, went on holiday to Florida in June 2002, Cummings had him fired as party chairman – a move Gove supported in the Times. Duncan Smith’s most important task, Gove wrote, was to “assert his authority over his party”, advising the Tory leader to learn from Al Capone. “Find the toughest guy in the room. Embrace him like a brother. And then slam his head against the wall.” A friend of Gove’s remembers meeting Cummings at the time. He and Gove were out to dinner and Gove spotted Cummings, introducing him as an acquaintance. Cummings was not then, and nor did he become, “one of the 20 or so friends who came to Michael’s birthday dinners”, I was told. The Camerons were part of that group, but Cummings, who was unmarried, was part of Gove’s other circle. “Michael’s world has always been split in two,” says the friend. There is family, and then “a male, policy world”. When Cameron gave Gove the shadow education brief in 2007, and Gove appointed Cummings as his special adviser, those two worlds collided. Two years later, Cummings rewarded the faith placed in him. In May 2009, the MPs’ expenses scandal broke, and nearly claimed Michael Gove. He had claimed on expenses £7,000 for redecorating a house, having spent thousands on high-end interior design. In Gove’s mind, he hung on because of Cummings, “who put together a strategy for him not having to resign”, says someone who knows them. Gove paid back the money, apologised, and survived. A year later Cummings rescued him again. With the coalition government two months old and austerity imminent, Gove’s education department repeatedly published an incorrect list of schools whose building projects would be scrapped. “It was a big issue, and it looked like Michael would have to resign – we were all floundering around hopelessly,” says a member of the department. Cummings, in exile at the time, was parachuted in. He “banged heads together”, produced the right list, and started to play the media more successfully. “He had saved Michael twice in quite short succession,” says the observer. “Michael really trusted his antennae after that.” As another confidant puts it, “At times like that, when the shit hits the fan, you realise who cuts it and who doesn’t.” Another figure from the Cameron era is less impressed by Cummings’s record. “There’s this idea that at the DfE he was great – he wasn’t, he was awful.” Academies and free schools, they say, should have been a flagship policy of the coalition. Yet during Cummings’s combative tenure, “Almost nobody in this country knew what they were.
