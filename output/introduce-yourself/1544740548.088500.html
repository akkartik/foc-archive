I'm a Javascript React frontend dev. Right now I'm trying out ideas on the side in a few areas:<br/>• Coloring interfaces. I'm actively working on an experiment for this. This work might be helpful for future app UI design tools. I'll post links on this soon.<br/>• Responsive components. I want to set breakpoints at the component level, not at the page level.<br/>• Random experiments in hierarchical and composable systems.<br/><br/>The hypothesis is that better primitives can unlock a lot of new possibilities, specifically for programming UIs.<br/><br/>Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> for tweeting a link to this. It's very exciting that there's a community of people who are interested in the future of coding.

Hmm, I've been thinking that the key primitive we need is some form of reliable and performant reactivity, so that we build UIs in a declarative way that flows "magically" from the underlying data (before reactivity became popular, I framed it differently - I thought we needed "propagating variables". Almost the same thing except that I was trying to figure out how to support cyclic dependencies, like in a temperature converter, how to update the "fahrenheit" box when you change the "celcius" box and vice versa. I didn't entirely figure out that part...).<br/><br/>While various other visual aids are useful, reactivity is the big thing in my mind. In this regard I suspect Vue.js is the best the JS world has so far (I have not enough experience to be sure.)

Reactive cyclical dependencies are tricky, but original Conal Elliot FRP figured them out. (You don't have to worry about the detail of how it works, but basically it works the same way recursive functions work - as a fixpoint.) I recently implemented the temperature converter (as part of the 7GUIs examples) with a JS FRP library and made a photo to explain what's going on.<br/><br/>Warning: I expect it'll be quite difficult to understand this stuff if you are new to "original Conal Elliot FRP". It took me ~1 year to fully get it, and still I often get confused.<br/><br/><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/o9p4j4p759">https://codesandbox.io/s/o9p4j4p759</a><br/><br/><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/52425583-9adfe380-2afc-11e9-803c-a3ab4b69f0a4.png">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/52425583-9&hellip;</a>
