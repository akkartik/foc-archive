Hi Future of Coding folk! I am Sam.<br/><br/>I realized I had never introduced myself here even though I have been around for a while.<br/><br/>I am a Software Engineer from Brazil. I have been into programming for the past 10 years. All this time I felt there was something suboptimal with the way we program today, both for fun and for work. That’s what motivated to start the unit project <a href="https://unit.md">https://unit.md</a>.<br/><br/>My initial approach for creating a new visual language was to go reference-less, so I would have to implement it from scratch, based mostly on intuition. I also wanted unit to feel like an “alien tool”, untied from the current state of the art aesthetics and user experience.<br/><br/>I felt we had all these cool Computer Science, Systems Programming and Design concepts, but no readily accessible fully visual system attempting to incorporate them all. My take was that this was a fundamentally a Software Engineering problem; it would likely take years for one to develop something like that.<br/><br/>One day a friend saw the prototype and mentioned Victor Bret. Later I was touched watching “Inventing on Principle”. That was my entrance to this rabbit hole; you know the rest. I can simply hear Allan Kay say something like “Recursive Design” and that is it. That is enough for me to start pursuing an year long new system feature.<br/><br/>I usually come here looking for some inspiration. Maybe some Programming Language concept I haven’t heard of, a fancy Structured Editing demo or some curated paper. It is impossible to compress all the cool stuff!<br/><br/>Finally, I am very thankful for the existence of this community! Good job everyone!
