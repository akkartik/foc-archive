I was rejected after the pair programming interview. \n\nFor now I am doing some part time multiplayer web app contract work while working on my personal projects.

I read the intro and some of the ideas. I have also struggled with reflecting on and sharing my work with others. I have been trying to get better at that. Writing every day has helped with the reflection. I like your idea of making a short video for reflection. I'd like to get to a place where my work is really in the open and people feel included in it and it feels collaborative. Takes work tho!",
