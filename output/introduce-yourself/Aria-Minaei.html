Hey folks, I'm Aria :wave:<br/><br/>Like most people here, I daydream FOC ideas :smile: I'm usually thinking about the gaps that separate groups of people, and how tools and languages can bridge those gaps.<br/><br/>I've been <em>trying</em> to do this as my job since 2014, but only managed to get there three years ago. I've been funding it with consulting, grants, and two very helpful angel investors.<br/><br/>What I'm working on is an authoring environment where developers and designers make things together. I usually describe it as a design tool that "blurs the line between designer/developer, author/consumer, and artist/scientist." If that sounds lofty, it's because it is. Right now it's just a modest animation editor for web apps that can be used by both designers and developers.<br/><br/>Short-term, it scratches an old itch. I always wanted to draw and code the same kind of stuff.<br/><br/>Long-term, I think this kind of environment (one that bridges manual and procedural creation), can be a building block to other FOC applications, like data/interactive journalism, exploratory learning, and trans-disciplinary authoring environments.<br/><br/>Also as a side-project, I'm building a personal memex. (<em>who isn't?</em> :man-shrugging:)<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm always up for a <a href="https://twitter.com/ariaminaei">call</a> to bounce ideas :blush:
