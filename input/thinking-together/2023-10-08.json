Not able to put it into exact words yet, but I have the feeling I'd like the pledge part to be more human and nature centred and less about economics. I do understand 'capitalism' and 'money' were your points of attention. And I'm also very much in favour of moving away from money as a driver for what we do or don't. If we try to move away from  economics (say \"no\" to), what are we actually after (say \"yes\" to), what could we pledge then? Just from the hip: \"I will build things which empower humans (instead of taking away their empowerment\/agency)\", 'I will build things others can build with me (search for co-creation)\", \"I will not build things which are 'over' sufficient (I will not build too much)\", \"I will build things that are durable for the foreseen lifetime\", etc. The last bit being about resource usage which has it marks on our environment(al footprint).\nI'm trying to see if I can come up with a more concise set of pledges the coming weeks. See how well I do on those in my work :wink:.\nKinda reminds me of the Inventing on Principle from Bret (Alex beat me to it, bringing Bret into the discussion :wink:).\n<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EGqwXt90ZqA>",

Not able to put it into exact words yet, but I have the feeling I'd like the pledge part to be more human and nature centred and less about economics. I do understand 'capitalism' and 'money' were your points of attention. And I'm also very much in favour of moving away from money as a driver for what we do or don't. If we try to move away from  economics (say \"no\" to), what are we actually after (say \"yes\" to), what could we pledge then? Just from the hip: \"I will build things which empower humans (instead of taking away their empowerment\/agency)\", 'I will build things others can build with me (search for co-creation)\", \"I will not build things which are 'over' sufficient (I will not build too much)\", \"I will build things that are durable for the foreseen lifetime\", etc. The last bit being about resource usage which has it marks on our environment(al footprint).\nI'm trying to see if I can come up with a more concise set of pledges the coming weeks. See how well I do on those in my work "

        "text": "<@UJBAJNFLK> Agreed! I'd love to see more ideas for a pledge that includes these topics.\n\nOne criterion that seems important to me is objectivity. It should be really obvious to someone juggling a baby whether you're hewing to your pledge or not. A pledge that tries to say more but permits equivocation seems like a net negative to me. Because then you can paper over broken promises with marketing. I.e. by spending money. Which brings us back to the sad situation we're trying to escape.\n\nIf you lived around the era of competing models of the cosmos in the late 1500s after Copernicus, you would be totally correct to expect that a good theory should explain the lack of Coriolis forces on the Earth's surface. But it took 300 years to get a good story here, and in the meantime we went through 3 more models of the heavens that incrementally improved things. So the world doesn't always cooperate with the expectations people have..\n\nAt this point in our history it seems to me that with some of these thorny questions like sustainability or efficiency, a direct approach is unlikely to succeed.

It should be really obvious to someone juggling a baby whether you're hewing to your pledge or not. A pledge that tries to say more but permits equivocation seems like a net negative to me. Because then you can paper over broken promises with marketing. I.e. by spending money. Which brings us back to the sad situation we're trying to escape.\n\nIf you lived around the era of competing models of the cosmos in the late 1500s after Copernicus, you would be totally correct to expect that a good theory should explain the lack of Coriolis forces on the Earth's surface.

Like, you don't even have to listen to my words, just compare what I was working on back in 2018 when I first came on here (e.g. <https:\/\/github.com\/akkartik\/mu\/blob\/main\/subx.md>) with now (e.g. <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/C03RR0W5DGC\/p1695690320693779>). The jury's still out over whether this is an improvement :laughing: But it's definitely a change.\n\nI've definitely also wished there was more coherence to the patterns by which we build on each other's work. The Slack medium _definitely_ doesn't help there. It's too easy for stuff to fall off our collective horizon. I think I'd appreciate a little bit more of the recent past intruding on the present in organic ways. Hopefully Linen will help there.",

I think it does a solid job making explicit some motivations that may otherwise not get engaged with in the open when doing a programming. \n\nThe bit that I’ve realized I found off putting is how neutral it is towards *power* — ideas like capital and gain are often framed in neutral terms, in ways that sort of place them as forces unto themselves.\n\nIn my thinking they’re not neutral and they aren’t things unto themselves. They’re byproducts or a proxy for the consolidation of power. \n\nWealth and capital and all that sorta stuff (see <@U013ZLJARC7>’s desire for more specificity around the term “capitalism”) are proxies for power. \n\nWhat I feel like might be missing is a more direct statement or acknowledgement of what a programs relationship is to power. How does it run up against an existing power, how does it support, complicate, or concentrate power?",

        "text": "Local vs. global is a key element in this, in my opinion. Many schemes work fine in the small, but don't scale up. The reason they work fine in the small is that the consequence of rules and actions are both easier to predict and easier to verify. Correcting mistakes and fixing bugs is easier as well. Promoting something that works in the small to a universally valid, or even morally necessary, principle is a huge paving stone on the road to hell.\n\nThat's also the problem I see with <@UCUSW7WVD>'s focus on objective\/easily verifiable engagement in the pledge. Of course that's a property worth having. But it's local, and doesn't scale up. You can respect your engagements and end up doing harm that way, because you didn't foresee the outcome of your rules, or because the environment changed in unexpected ways. On the other hand, you can announce lofty goals that nobody knows how to achieve, and end up doing harm while pretending to keep your promises.\n\nThere's a reason why nations have a constitution for vague but global goals, in addition to laws for precise but (time-)local rules. For the same reason, scientific research practices (local, rule-based) need philosophy (global, value-based) as a complement. And both need to evolve as history unfolds.",

The reason they work fine in the small is that the consequence of rules and actions are both easier to predict and easier to verify. Correcting mistakes and fixing bugs is easier as well. Promoting something that works in the small to a universally valid, or even morally necessary, principle is a huge paving stone on the road to hell.\n\nThat's also the problem I see with "

You can respect your engagements and end up doing harm that way, because you didn't foresee the outcome of your rules, or because the environment changed in unexpected ways. On the other hand, you can announce lofty goals that nobody knows how to achieve, and end up doing harm while pretending to keep your promises.\n\nThere's a reason why nations have a constitution for vague but global goals, in addition to laws for precise but (time-)local rules. For the same reason, scientific research practices (local, rule-based) need philosophy (global, value-based) as a complement. And both need to evolve as history unfolds."
