These days I do a lot of software development with image processing and computer vision.\n\nI've been working on an image-based personal search engine for about 4 years now. I didn't know at the time I started it, but it's sorta kinda... very much like Vannevar Bush's Memex. It is a commercial project - happy to share it if that's appropriate.\n\nOutside of that, I've been making a lot of tiny programs lately - a webpage that <https:\/\/foxrow.com\/wordle|always shows me yesterday's wordle>, a random-background-wallpaper-grabber (feels like getting a new computer!), putting <https:\/\/simonwillison.net\/2020\/Oct\/9\/git-scraping\/|this data tracking technique> by Simon Willison (of Django fame) into practice.\n\nGlad to be here, and I'm happy to chat if any of that sounds interesting!",
