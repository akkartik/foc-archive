Be you a gamer or a coder. I'm wondering if it would be interesting to try to describe the itch. But in a way that could be discussed with others. What fires me up? What am I passionate about? What do I hate? I'm immediately questioning my own itch. Now I love computers and art and music. And I love creating in all those mediums. But when it comes down to it I love love more than anything else. I realise after 56 years (and counting) I'm using those mediums in service of that love. I want everyone to love themselves and each other. I was writing songs about world peace in my early teens. Sounds sickly, eh? ;-)\n\nI think the \"alive\" property is subjective. It depends on the person's itch. For example, using a DAW immerses us in a live audio environment with properties just like a physical recording studio of old (pre-digital). Is that the itch? But when I'm dreaming of world peace\/love, I take delight in writing a song that'll get the message over or a bit of tech that might lead people to value their own power. I'm driven by the goal. So, it doesn't matter what I'm doing: the goal\/itch provides the context for the medium I'm working in – it provides the \"alive\". Because I'm always imagining what the impact, of what I'm creating, will have on the people who will listen to it or will use it – or maybe I'm just liking how I might feel. And I admit it's total fantasy. But hey! Fantasy is powerful.\n\nWhile we're on it, personally, I'm a little bit _creeped out_ by Dynamicland. I'm not sure I want all pervasive computing environments. I want to be able to switch off. Switch off everything. Detox. For days if necessary. I sometimes want my interface to real life to be just real life and nothing else. So, systems that are capable of being switched off and still allow humans to function as humans is a prerequisite to sane systems AFAIAC. I hope we keep the _steering wheels_ in self driving cars – just in case. There's something about computers that I don't fully feel comfortable with – I think it's related to the fact that most computer systems reduce reality to a binary stream. And no matter the resolution of the AD conversion it leaves a metallic taste in my mouth. I want clear separation between my body and everything else.\n\nI'll take a deeper look into HEST. It may have answer to my desire to create apps just like I create spreadsheets with Excel. Thanks!",
