They wanted to offer an alternative to that\nSo I think in every way, IndieFund is able to offer unique funding and unique perspective.\n\nThe questions I’d have for a FoC fund are:\n\n• What can the community uniquely offer an FoC project? _Can we be the ‘best’ option for this?_\n• What does a FoC style project actually need? _Grants? Reliable funding commitments? Something else?_",
