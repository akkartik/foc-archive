Hi! I'm Spencer. I live in NYC.<br/><br/>I have had crazy ideas about programming languages bouncing around in my head for at least a year now. It seems to me that inadequacies in our programming languages and surrounding tooling are the root cause of most technological troubles.<br/><br/>I've previously worked with computer vision, where I implemented a number of image processing algorithms. The tools we used were grossly insufficient for the task. CUDA was painfully low level, all algorithms became mucked up with performance concerns, code was not portable, build systems were tangled nightmares of dependencies on antiquated software from the 70's... I've been trying to find a better way.<br/><br/>My ideas are still vague and poorly defined but a month ago I started taking these thoughts seriously. I've been learning type theory in an attempt to gain the necessary background to either implement my ideas or determine if they are even feasible. I have a very long way to go to acquire enough background to even understand what I'm getting into... but you have to start somewhere!

Build systems!  When they're good, you don't give them a second thought.  May help prevent their spread.

Parallel/GPU Programming in C++/CUDA/OpenCL was also an initial motivation for me. Spending days working around build system issues and hundreds of lines of cryptic compiler errors and being told that print-statements were state of the art debugging in this area really got me thinking that there must be a better way. Welcome to the group :+1:

Welcome! Yeah those levels of abstraction and indirection add up fast. Mental mapping and decoding of cryptic messages from all across the stack is considered 'state of the art'.

At my current job - which involves some CUDA and nightmarishly tangled unportable code - I've been trying to find some time to look into Halide ( <a href="http://halide-lang.org/">http://halide-lang.org/</a> ) as an alternative to standard CUDA, but other employees don't seem very interested (granted, I don't yet know if Halide is powerful enough for our purposes, but I want to at least find out.)<br/><br/>Anyway, good luck Spencer.
