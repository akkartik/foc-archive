i think this is an excellent talk, even if it deals primarily with c++ (a language i’ve sworn never to work in): <a href="https://youtu.be/W2tWOdzgXHA">https://youtu.be/W2tWOdzgXHA</a> <br/>i know a common and solid, (or to talk like <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span>, steelman) criticism of a language like APL is that it’s great as long as your problem can be elegantly posed as array manipulation. this talk (to be glib) is about how an enormous amount of production c++ code can be reduced to a few library functions (primarily rotate lol). it’s making me think we shouldn’t necessarily evaluate programming languages or libraries by how flexibly they admit extremely divergent domain languages on the immediate syntax level—maybe there’s a test for a language or library’ whose <b>semantics</b> are comfortable with abstracting (with very precise slices or joinery) domain-specific stuff back into the language’s native functions and data types with minimal effort. <br/><br/>feels like an old timey hacker news take but i mean it in a new light, where rather than insisting that everyone’s framework should actually be written in lisp, or c, there may be some abstractions that you can build a language around that map to most of the stuff that people do in the 21st century. something appealingly physical about rotate to me. maybe that’s why i’ve been so into apl (for collections) rebol (for scoping) and forth (for ordering) lately. sorry if basically a diary entry isn’t appropriate for slack. i don’t really know how i’d turn this thought into a blog post lmao

Higher-order functions are imo the best example of a critical-yet-general language feature for concisely expressing domain-specific abstractions. “No raw loops” is another way of saying ” have a proper higher-order API for your collections”.
