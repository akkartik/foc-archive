Hi, I'm Colby, I've been working on the Scratch backend systems since 2015, starting with the MIT Media Lab and we have just moved out of MIT and are officially in our own Scratch Foundation org. My coding history started in 1989 using Borland Turbo Pascal, and has been cross systems/paradigms since that point and in no particular order Perl to Ruby, Python, Java, C, C++, Go, Node, assembly, JavaScript, my own DSLs, and of course Scratch. My current focus is supporting the deluge of Scratch users needs. Long term, I'm hoping to help incorporate Scratch into a cross compiler/cross platform frameworks that allows the ability to use Scratch in much broader contexts. I am based in the Boston MA area. And I was brought here by someone else on the Scratch team!
