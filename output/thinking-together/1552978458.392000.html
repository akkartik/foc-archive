One of the most interesting things on the domain of maths is the fractal-like category boundaries between provable, provably unprovable and the what-the-heck-is-I-don't-even. In computation the design tradeoffs on algorithms and data structures sometimes feel a bit similar... and, well: there's a point in real world applications where one just has to bite the bullet and accept that there's no general clean solution but it's tradeoffs all the way down.<br/><br/>So the best one can do in cases like these is to make sure people have the chance to see the warning signs "Ask an expert once you venture beyond here." on their way.
