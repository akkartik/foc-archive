Now you run it, step through your code, what do you see - _call\/return functions!_ There's an error, what do you get? _Call\/return function stack traces!_ Wait, what happened to the dataflow objects, or other objects of your programming model? They're there, but they don't correspond to the runtime\/debugging\/failure model. The standard answer is 'build extra tooling'. This is the additional overhead, of mapping between architectural model and call\/return. A very common example here is using async handlers - _the call stacks are meaningless because the 'process of interest' is fragmented across multiple stacks and runtime state (the process of execution)._\n\nThe paper gives a few examples where 'call\/return' is not used in defining a system (e.g. constraint connectors and storage combinators). An excerpt from the constraint connectors language on page 12:\n```ivar:f |= (9.0\/5.0) * ivar:c + 32 .```\nThis expression describes the constraint between `f` and `c` and importantly, does not employ call\/return semantics.\n\nThe key point is you can build other models on top of call\/return, so we end up doing it everywhere:\n&gt; While there are few attempts to generalise from call\/return to connectors, there are many, trying to simulate different architectural styles using call\/return style programming is very common.\nThe main thing the paper is arguing for is more research into support for other styles natively, and not simulation by call\/return. Call\/return is a very specific kind of pattern - data in \/ data out - it's a calculator. But where does the data go? And where does it come from? The system is not a call\/return function - but why is all the wiring and ongoing behavior implemented with call\/return calculators?",
