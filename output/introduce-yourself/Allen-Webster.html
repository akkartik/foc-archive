Hi everyone! I am a developer, currently at Epic Games. My interest in development tools started with making 4coder, a text editor (that I still use now!). In the course of that project I realized I couldn't achieve most of the things I would want to because of the limits of the text-file-centric paradigm. Last year I started exploring how to build something outside of that paradigm with a small team and in my research I discovered the FoC community. I've been lurking on the edges since then. I'm interested to see more of what other people out there are doing.
