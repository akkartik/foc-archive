The Loyc structure works okay, but where it will break down in terms of offering language translateability is that the real problem with language conversion is not the operators; those are typically fairly straightforward to parse:  a + b means the + operator with two operands.The killer problem is all the symbol table gyrations that come up, with all the subtle context switches. For example, you have a static global named x, a field in a record named x, a local variable named x, and the compiler is tracking a very complex web of inheritance chains to figure out which x you mean at any one time. Your conversion program would need to disambiguate the names. In my current work more than 50% of the total effort of the compiler is tracking all the symbol information. In inferred type languages, where the programmer doesn't have to specify explicitly the type, but it is inferred through various means, it gets extremely difficult to nail down the type, but one must of course do this to remap the code. So although the goal of your project is laudable, i believe it will become impossible, else you would be implementing a compiler for each language, just to map it to another. If two languages are similar enough the mapping can go one way pretty easily but to go bidirectionally between a wide variety of languages would be a massive and quite difficult task.

I was asking about LES/LTs specifically, but you're welcome to discuss broader goals. May I ask what your current work is about?

As a facilitator, i am trying to bring all the next-gen general purpose language designers into some form of communication and/or cooperation. Inertia being the most powerful force in the universe, the real competitors are not so much other language projects, but the entrenched languages and their many supporters. Language designers are a prickly bunch because they all fall in love with the creations which are like a baby. I have a general purpose language project Beads which is a fusion of a declarative/deductive type of language bundled with a graphical/event model and a graph database.<br/><br/>One of things i have been building are specifications and working examples for a series of reference programs so that potential users can better evaluate which language they want to invest their time learning in detail. We only have so many hours to spend learning new tools vs. using the tools, and one of the things that makes it so hard is that the exact same program is not often implemented across multiple languages. The TodoMVC app for example is one of the worst examples possible, because it relies on text entry fields as the primary data being manipulated, and the text entry field is really the domain of the operating system, as there are at a  million lines of code underlying text input with all the tricky aspects of font rendering, input method control, etc. The reason modern graphical operating systems are so few in number is that when you say "i would like to have Asian language support", that blows up into a monster project. The majority of people on this earth don't use the Roman alphabet, and just Japanese by itself is mind-bogglingly difficult to handle. So i am concentrating on things like a clock, wristwatch, tic-tac-toe, snake, chess, and will be adding some engineering and finance examples. If you can't make a stock portfolio report easily your language will never make it in finance for example.

In Academia for example they used to Towers of Hanoi examples and things like that which are intrinsically recursive in their solution. the problem with those types of examples is they are purely terminal based. We are not in the 70's any more, and a language which is terminal-only has zero chance in today's reality.  Graphics really raises the bar for a language trying to gain adoption IMHO.

This is one of the big things holding back Erlang/Elixir, they were designed assuming an external link to a graphical model, so then none of the language features support drawing.  Drawing code is a sizable fraction of every modern graphical interactive product, if you start counting source code tokens as a percentage. All of the older languages predate graphical interfaces and have not aged well as a consequence. I am sure many people wish we could go back to Commodore/Apple 2 days where the screen was character based, and the 80 x 24 matrix was a dream to work with; so easy, so concrete.
