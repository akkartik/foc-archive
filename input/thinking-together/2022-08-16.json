        "text": "Hi <@U013ZLJARC7> , apologies if I came across as flippant; not my intention. I merely wanted to suggest that speed of execution might be faster if you use the tools you know best. I've found that, while fun to try different languages, there is a knowledge wall which eventually inhibits progress. Sonic Pi comes to mind. I've been a core contributor to that for a while. It is implemented in no less than 4 languages; C++, Elixir, Ruby &amp; Erlang; with significant code in each one.  While a great project, progress is inevitably slow because Sam is really the only one that comes close to understanding how everything works. One thing I've heard Sam say is that ‘Elixir gives me this nice real time scheduling which is great for music’. My personal opinion is that you can achieve that just as easily with most languages. They are all just deep stacks sitting on your CPU.  The down side of the approach is, as I say, speed of implementation. The barrier to entry for Sonic Pi development is huge; it requires technical abilities in many areas to make significant contributions.",

I merely wanted to suggest that speed of execution might be faster if you use the tools you know best. I've found that, while fun to try different languages, there is a knowledge wall which eventually inhibits progress. Sonic Pi comes to mind. I've been a core contributor to that for a while. It is implemented in no less than 4 languages; C++, Elixir, Ruby & Erlang; with significant code in each one.  While a great project, progress is inevitably slow because Sam is really the only one that comes close to understanding how everything works. One thing I've heard Sam say is that ‘Elixir gives me this nice real time scheduling which is great for music’. My personal opinion is that you can achieve that just as easily with most languages. They are all just deep stacks sitting on your CPU.  The down side of the approach is, as I say, speed of implementation. The barrier to entry for Sonic Pi development is huge; it requires technical abilities in many areas to make significant contributions."

        "text": "I think the way people kinda want all this live stuff to work is like the diversion of the flow of water.\n\nBits are flowing from `main()` to some unknown `end()` call. There are tributaries and side branches and loops in the river, but it flows in one direction. People want to be able to stick a hypothetical dam and controls in any spot of the river, and watch the changes occur. The analogy fails because water is slow, and bits are fast. But it’s the _immediacy_ that matters - the instantaneous physics of the interaction.\n\nNote, you can actually break the river permanently if you dam up the right spots.. `e.g.`, break the running state of the application, `e.g. x 2`,  <@UA14TGLTC>;s comment above. And that’s where all the “live state saving” stuff kicks in. If you dam the wrong outlet and blow something on the other side of the lake, you can press and button and *poof* your back in time.\n\nI see this best day to day, honestly, really well in SwiftUI. You write a line of code, it takes a second to recompile it, and displays the result in a virtual preview. Did you write a line that doesn’t compile and can’t produce a preview? No problem - the “magic state” is the IDE, and all you have to do is modify the code. That should evolve to the rest of the system, and it sort of does. If I tickle some part of the model in a layer elsewhere, the act of recompiling will produce the new preview. It’s implicit, but it happens.",

If I tickle some part of the model in a layer elsewhere, the act of recompiling will produce the new preview. It’s implicit, but it happens."
