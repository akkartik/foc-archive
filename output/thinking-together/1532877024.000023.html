Unrelated to what I wrote above: Would it be useful to create a #europe channel for those of us living here? I would love to get some discussion going about a more personal meeting in that part of the world, but can't really tell if we have enough people here. I'd be happy to set up a physical meet-up in London, UK, but it looks like that would be a rather small one.
