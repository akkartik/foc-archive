It comes very close to what you are describing. Each \"function\" is available at the \"shell\" (they call it something else, I think \"listener\"?). When you invoke a function from the listener, it does have autocomplete. E.g. if it accepts a file, all the filenames on the screen will \"light up\" and become clickable. This works because fundamentally it is not dumping streams of text on a tty, but _attaching presentation objects on the screen_ - so each visible presentation is linked to the backing object and its type is available to the system. There are some details in this short demo: <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=o4-YnLpLgtk>.\n\nYou can also introspect and jump to source from the listener.
