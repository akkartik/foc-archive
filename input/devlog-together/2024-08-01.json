I think all 3 are achievable, and are already sufficiently achieved for the immediate needs of this project. The parsing worries expressed in this thread are missing the point of markdown. (For those who know their markdown history — I side solidly with Gruber, and solidly against Atwood.)\n\nI'm going to go ahead and ship what I've got. That's the spirit I'd like to engender with this project — just get something out there, it doesn't have to be perfect. If people try to use it and find that something about the setup impedes their desire or ability to contribute to the wiki, we can work on that concrete problem. I don't expect that what I have will work perfectly, especially not at first. That's a non-goal. The goal is to get people writing wiki entries.\n\n(And because I love a framing, even one I disagree with: 3, … … … … … … …  1, 2)",

I think all 3 are achievable, and are already sufficiently achieved for the immediate needs of this project. The parsing worries expressed in this thread are missing the point of markdown. (For those who know their markdown history — I side solidly with Gruber, and solidly against Atwood.)\n\nI'm going to go ahead and ship what I've got. That's the spirit I'd like to engender with this project — just get something out there, it doesn't have to be perfect. If people try to use it and find that something about the setup impedes their desire or ability to contribute to the wiki, we can work on that concrete problem. I don't expect that what I have will work perfectly, especially not at first. That's a non-goal. The goal is to get people writing wiki entries.\n\n(And because I love a framing, even one I disagree with: 3, … … … … … … …  1, 2)"
