<em>(frantically throws together some kind of intro before heading to meet everyone at Dynamicland)</em><br/><br/>Hello there! I’m Yoz, a short bald Brit who lives in Oakland and works in SF. I’ve been lurking on this Slack for a while after enjoying a few episodes of Steve’s podcast. Some relevant bits of history:<br/>1. Ever since I first logged onto <b>LambdaMOO</b> in 1993, I’ve been obsessed with the potential for <b>shared programmable worlds</b>. This led me to 5 years working at <b>Linden Lab</b>, the creators/maintainers of <b>Second Life</b>, Blocksworld and Sansar, all of which are shared programmable worlds like MOO. It taught me a huge amount about the underestimated benefits and problems of these systems.<br/>2. I spent 4 years at <b>18F</b>, a consultancy within the US Government. It teaches departments about agile development &amp; procurement, user-centered design and open source, all with the aim of serving citizens better. Most of my time was spent both programming new systems and learning about legacy ones. <b>It convinced me that most of our software development was inherently a bad idea</b>, and that it would be better to build on no-code/low-code systems, and to focus on empowering staffers rather than automating their jobs away.<br/>3. I’m fascinated by debugging, with existing and new tools. I’ve given talks on debugging (see thread) and played around with creating new debugging tools.<br/>4. These days I’m something of a software pessimist, to the point where I’m not sure that we should be teaching kids to code at all - at least, not until we are able to sufficiently manage the complexity we create.<br/>5. I love amazing bug stories - see the thread for a couple, and also for my favourite computing paper.<br/><br/>Looking forward to meeting and chatting with folks!
