So in summary, I'd measure the complexity of a program as the product of the complexities of the top-level behaviours exposed by the program. The complexity of an individual behaviour is similar to the aforementioned "parameter space" concept, but the parameters themselves are abstractions (objects / data types). For OOP programs, the complexities of behaviours are usually high because the complexities of the abstractions they accept (mutable objects) are high. For functional programs the complexities of behaviours are usually low because the complexities of the abstractions they accept (immutable data) are low.
