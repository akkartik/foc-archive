What I had in <https:\/\/github.com\/akkartik\/mu> (really <https:\/\/github.com\/akkartik\/mu1>) was quite hokey.\n\nI believe trusted components basically work by preventing automation and hindering discoverability. Is that accurate?\n\nOne thing I care about is being able to continue using an app without granting all requested privileges. For example, easily creating a fake file system with honeypot data. That feels orthogonal to capabilities. They don't preclude it, but they also don't make it easy by themselves.\n\nSo I feel like there are some trade-offs to weigh here. But maybe I'm wrong and it's all a solved problem. Pointers most appreciated.",

Is that accurate?\n\nOne thing I care about is being able to continue using an app without granting all requested privileges. For example, easily creating a fake file system with honeypot data. That feels orthogonal to capabilities. They don't preclude it, but they also don't make it easy by themselves.\n\nSo I feel like there are some trade-offs to weigh here. But maybe I'm wrong and it's all a solved problem. Pointers most appreciated."
