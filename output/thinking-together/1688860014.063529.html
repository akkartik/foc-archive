Another thing. My wife worked at a legal research company for a while and she kept pausing the podcast (I subjected her to) to comment on the legal side of things. One thing she pointed out is that civil law is about codifying and interpreting laws to judge situations, but <em>common law</em> is basically a series of precedents. You try a case, if it's novel you invent a judgment. If it's similar to a previous case you adopt/adapt the previous judgment and it becomes a new more refined precedent for future situations.<br/><br/>Not sure the mapping here. I'm imagining when Ivan puts in his address to buy a ticket, instead of "invalid address" and end of story, the software responds, "this format of address is new to us, please await trial" and forwards it to the Airline Judge who renders judgment that is then encoded as precedent in the software itself.

I mean, I have every unhandled exception on my SaaS app fire an email to me.<br/><br/>Some days, I wake up with 2000 emails.<br/><br/>But most days, if there's any error email at all, it's a good "huh â€” didn't know <em>that</em> was a thing that could happen. Let me go fix that!"<br/><br/>So I think yours is a good idea.

Maybe my first takeaway is, I would totally alarm on 500s, but the address thing would be codified as a 400. I wonder if there is a scalable model of validation that doesn't rely on the certainty of "not recognized = invalid" and puts you in the loop. Or an LLM in the loop, maybe (although that just seems to pass the buck a bit).
