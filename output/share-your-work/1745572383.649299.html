Hey all,<br/><br/>I've built a plugin for Figma that allows designers to do more with data visualisation, inspired by the 'Drawing Dynamic Visualisations' but than building on top of the already existing experience and knowledge of designers in Figma. It is using the Figma API to adjust instances of components to represent types of data.<br/><br/>I made two versions for now, one that is build with Monaco to allow the designers to use text to couple data from JSON into a Figma Frame (which was originally a tool I needed myself) and one that is having UI where users can couple data to properties of the elements (which I'm happy to get feedback on this concept; and if there is cool examples in this space let me know).<br/><br/>If you want to read more on the process or want to check it out; see the Medium Article: <a href="https://medium.com/@geert.roumen/figmata-a76bf9008806">https://medium.com/@geert.roumen/figmata-a76bf9008806</a>
