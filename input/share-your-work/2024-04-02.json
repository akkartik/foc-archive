The fact that character mapped to `Shift-'\/'` does not equal the character mapped to `Meta-Shift-'\/'` is not a mistake and needs not be corrected. As soon as you add another modifier, you're in a different and unrelated group in the keyboard layout, and you can't assume that the `Meta-Shift` group equals the `Shift` group.\n\nThere's really no such thing as `Control-'?'`. When I see such a key binding, it confuses me, and I think it was made by some American who has a question mark key on their keyboard, and I assume it's not accessible to me. The key binding is really `Control-Shift-'\/'`, regardless of whether `Shift-'\/'` happens to type a question mark.\n\nKeyboard layouts vary in what modifiers need to be pressed. Imagine you have the key binding `Shift-'1'`, and then someone comes with a Czech keyboard, which requires holding `Shift` to type digits, and then the key binding becomes the nonsensical `Shift-Shift-'+'`.\n\nHere's an excerpt from a handbook I'm writing in text editor design:\n\n&gt; Key bindings should be the actual keys on the keyboard, not the characters the keys type after applying a keyboard layout that may change due to locale and user preference. _Control-z_ should be the same place on the keyboard regardless of whether the keyboard layout causes the _z_ key to type the character _z_ (English), _y_ (German), _w_ (French), _–Ø_ (Russian) or _;_ (Dvorak).",
