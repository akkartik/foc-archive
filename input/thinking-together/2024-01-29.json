I think many of these could be actually tackled with clear marketing, good documentation, integrating into existing ecosystems, custom LLM:s for learning, etc.\n\n1. Selecting a new platform takes a lot of time and it is difficult to compare platforms without trying each one of them out. There should be more articles that compare dev platforms, libraries, boilerplates etc.\n2. It is not clear to me if the dev tools are actually solving any of the problems I have\n    a. Fast creation of storage, backends, payments, auth\n    b. Transparent easy-to-understand architecture\n    c. Limited boilerplate, little code, easy to debug\n3. The benefits are not large enough in comparison to the effort of switching and risk.\n    a. Time to learn a new programming toolset or paradigm is quite large compared to accumulated knowledge from 10-20 years. Time I can spend on learning is very limited. :confused:\n    b. Lack of supported tooling \/ libraries \/ Stack Overflow responses for new platforms\n4. Not clear if the tools can be used to build \"real\" products, such as iOS apps, commercial web apps, etc\nThe benefits need to be huge for users to switch to a new product, see \"9x effect\":\n<https:\/\/elezea.com\/2013\/07\/9x-effect\/>\n\nOriginally stumbled upon the concept here:\n<https:\/\/www.intercom.com\/resources\/books\/intercom-jobs-to-be-done>",
