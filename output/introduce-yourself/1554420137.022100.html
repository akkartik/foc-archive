I'm excited to meet someone who worked at Intentional Software! I've watched videos of Charles Simonyi talk about links in code being stored as strong references, and about generative programming. I don't think think those concepts are foreign to this community, but I was very excited to see a real company (Intentional) formed around doing programming that way. I look forward to whatever insights you can find and provide in this community.

I really hope that someday some artifact of all that work makes it out of Microsoft! It's very frustrating to me that it's never been made available to the public at all.

The main project while I was there was a general-purpose structured editor called the Intentional Domain Workbench. You defined a schema for your language, we gave you an IDE, which you could progressively enhance with custom notations and functionality.<br/><em>Everything</em> in the system was built around tree transformations - the entire editor was a series of compiler passes from domain code to an editor language to a layout language to a graphics language - and all transformations had rich mappings between their input and output, so you could connect a pixel on the screen back to its source. <br/>I spent most of my time working on persistence and version control - merging of trees based on full edit history, unobtrusively modelling conflicts, etc. <br/>We had a couple of pilot customers that we built workbenches for, to prove out the approach - iirc we demoed one based around administrating pensions a few times. There are screenshots for sure, not sure if there's video.

It sounds similar to Jetbrains MPS. If you are familiar with it, can you explain how it's the same or different?

Version control (and merging and comparing) of trees (versus pain text) would be invaluable to what many of us are trying to do. I'd be interested in learning more about that. Is that something that might ever become available? (As a separate tool, or as part of IDW?)

Yes, MPS is the closest thing I'm aware of that's actually available. Unfortunately I haven't spent much time actually using it, so I can't really comment on specific differences except very superficially, ie. Intentional's tooling was based on C#/.NET instead of Java. <br/>The one time I tried it was many years ago, iirc the only thing I tried was to rename a thing and see if the references updated, which iirc they didn't. I don't know if I misunderstood something, am misremembering, or if they've fixed that since, but such an edit would have impossible with Intentional's representation; names were a property of the thing, not references to the thing. This was core; you could have any number of names assigned to something - i18n for your variables, both short and long names, etc. At one point we added "friendly" names to some of our core language features, which were originally named with Hungarian notation :)

Intentional's product strategy is something I can't speculate on; they started staffing up significantly around the time I left, but I honestly don't know what all those developers were doing. I know they were purchased by Microsoft a couple of years ago now; whether that means we'll see the public release of development tools or some other application of the tech, I don't know.

At a very high level, every edit in the tool appended to a changelog that described the edits in enough detail that it could be played back to reproduce the document, or undone. Every node in the source tree had a unique identity, so we could directly tell the difference between "delete/insert" and "move". If we couldn't apply a change cleanly, we'd insert information about the conflict into the document. (The "conflict" domain was simply another language that could be freely intermixed into any document due to the flexibility of our tree representation.) Charles patented this as "Perfect Source Control".

I find the whole conversation about changelogs, and fancy source control to be depressing. If Tolstoy who wrote War &amp; Peace, one of the greatest books ever written entirely in longhand, can create a complex, threaded story, without worrying about backtracking, why is it that people are so interested in what the code used to be? That isn't productivity, source control is about damage control from people breaking stuff who can't understand the implications of the changes they are making, because stuff is too tightly interconnected. In my system i am striving for super-compartmentalization, so that changes don't ripple throughout the system, and have unseen, unpredictable consequences. CSS is my poster child for unpredictable results from small changes. I think CSS is the most devilish thing ever devised in computers, one of the primary motivations for my development efforts is my extreme distaste for CSS.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you can author sequentially, and the computer turns it into recursion, and depth-first/breadth-first searches, and automatic sorting, with no joins or tricky concepts, it should be possible for individuals to write large products with no stress.<br/><br/>I always found that programs with no branches and a straight down flow were easy to program. So the goal is to have zero IF statements, and linear flow. Let the computer do the tricky bit of  re-sequencing. That is the goal.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@magicmouse94937</span> In practice for real world projects history of the code is crucially important. If I release a new version of my product and a customer experiences a bug that didn’t exist in the previous version, the first thing I’d go for is bisecting on when was it introduced and what change made it appear. One may argue that by definition there are no bugs in War &amp; Peace,, only features. Well maybe War is a bug :wink:
