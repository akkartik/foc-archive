Here's the current state of people's reactions to each other's problem statements. If you haven't added your reactions yet, please consider doing so! If you haven't written a problem statement yet, please do so before reacting to those of others. I know it's a non-trivial bit of work. I tend to open Slack on two windows somehow to jump between <a href="1722547627.788149.html">the problem statement thread</a> and <a href="1722660123.009799.html">the problem reaction thread</a> :face_palm::skin-tone-3: But it does seem like something promising to think about.<br/><br/>I've also included a very rough, very preliminary, very incomplete stab at visualizing clusters of people's problem statements. There's no reason to think this "space" is Euclidean or 2D, so take it with a huge bucket of salt.<br/><br/>The visualization is in no way mapping status relationships. The intent is not to exclude anyone, but a very narrow instrumental purpose of finding opportunities to collaborate. If you need an analogy, a better one might be a star chart. It seems safe to assume we're all light years apart given our track record of collaborating :smile: This picture is an initial attempt at making a map based on imprecise measurements from a single point. If you spend any time thinking about the map, try to build your own from the raw data to avoid my inevitable biases.<br/><br/>I started out with <tt>Kartik</tt> at the origin (no objectivity here!) and positioned first my 1s, then my 2s, then 3s and so on all the way to 6s. Then I tried to go through others similarly and resolve tensions in a very rough, very manual way. I might do this a few times to try to get better at it.<br/><br/>Even though this "data set" is almost certainly high-dimensional, a few 1-D relationships popped out at me:<br/>• <tt>Kartik -&gt; Tom</tt> + <tt>Tom -&gt; Paul</tt> = <tt>Kartik -&gt; Paul</tt><br/>• <tt>Kartik -&gt; Tom</tt> + <tt>Tom -&gt; Nilesh</tt> = <tt>Kartik -&gt; Nilesh</tt><br/>I responded by putting the 4 of us on a straight line. There may be a spectrum here that bridges the incomprehension between the ends.<br/><br/>This sort of bridging of incomprehension is a common pattern. I initially had <tt>Ivan</tt> as far away from <tt>Kartik</tt> as <tt>Paul</tt>. But several connections drew the <tt>Ivan</tt>/<tt>Eli</tt> cluster closer. <tt>Dany</tt> too might be as far from me as <tt>Paul</tt>, but is just 1 away from <tt>Jimmy</tt>. <tt>Guyren</tt> too, but is close to <tt>Tom</tt> and <tt>Dany</tt>. So some of these edges have more "tension" than others, and I haven't come up with a way yet to show that.<br/><br/>(I'm currently showing edges labeled 1-3. If we get more data I might need to prune that further. The edges are directional but unfortunately <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/snap.love">my tool</a> doesn't have arrows.)<br/><br/>Anyways. Add your problem statements and reactions!

Just waiting for data atm. It's only been a day and it seems like that's shorter than your time between checks of the Slack? There are probably others like that.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Paul Tarvydas</span>, have you thought about plotting the distances as a graph on Kinopio like I do here? I'm very curious what something like that might look like. Probably a better experience than my janky app.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> Not yet. My knee-jerk reaction is to think in terms of line-thickness, colour, transparency, size, off-page linking. I haven't played with the data yet - still procrastinating. After watching Orion's use of tldraw, I wonder if assigning different values of -ve gravity might result in interesting results? (but, Kinopio doesn't do that kind of thing). Or, maybe Obsidian's "graph view" would (finally) come in handy?

That was a fun experiment, I hope people don't put too much weight into the numbers, the problem statements were often just too short / vague.<br/>Maybe a more comprehensive survey would lead to better numbers?

I'm building up to a retrospective thread for people to leave comments, ask for clarification, etc. And then maybe a synchronous conversation?!
