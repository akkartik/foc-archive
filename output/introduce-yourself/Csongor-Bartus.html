Hello, I have a degree in Computer Science, and I live in Romania, EU.<br/><br/>I do mostly research & development and occasionally I take on commercial projects for revenue.<br/>My focus is web design & front-end development. Yes, I'm a self-taught designer with works featured in online galleries.<br/><br/>My current research is provably correct, likely correct software + rapid iterations. My previous research was on design systems.<br/><br/>I'm reading the FoC newsletter since ~2021 -- and now it became the most important source of inspiration. I'm waiting every Monday morning !!<br/>It's the first time I'm having something to add, so I'm joining the community.<br/><br/>Thank you for all, and keep up! :slightly_smiling_face:
