Hey, all! I'm Declan, I develop calculang, a language for calculations (<a href="http://calculang.dev">calculang.dev</a> @calculang on twitter/fosstodon). I've been lurking in the group for some weeks now and look forward to sharing a new gallery/playground and other bits about calculang soon and hearing your feedback!<br/>calculang is about a bunch of things, but fundamentally about separating numbers from programming so they can be visualized, followed, communicated and things that are relatively hard when mixed with general programming.<br/>By itself it fits in the FP space too: everything is a pure function, and "input inference" is intended to make the functions (or 'formulas') flexible by removing the tedious threading of arguments. This is the only really technical thing and it's &lt;100 LOC and something I found really interesting to play with.<br/>Since I only care about pure numbers calculang should integrate with other programming languages to 'do things': mainly Javascript now (calculang transpiles into JS). + I'm beginning to do some things with Python maybe Julia.<br/>My examples focus a lot on visualization and interactivity with numbers/their models, which JS is well primed for, but needs to generalize better also like spreadsheets do.<br/>I look forward to sharing progress and to learning from the community! :grinning:
