Ethereum Name Service is probably the most useful applications of blockchains I have seen so far. Filecoin is another interesting use of blockchains: a cryptocurrency used for paying for data storage, with verifiable storage replacing the \"proof of work\" of bitcoin.\nAs for hash collisions, you never seem to find another reply than the theoretical estimations of their very low probability. I doubt anyone knows how likely they are in practice for real data, but IPFS is a real-life experiment to find out. I also wonder about the possibility of hash-collision-based DOS attacks, such a massively injecting random data into IPFS. For now I am looking at IPFS merely out of curiosity, so it's not a reason to worry.\nOne advantage of IPFS is that its hash algorithm is not baked in. If SHA256 turns out to be insufficient, they can switch to something else without abandoning existing data.",

Ethereum Name Service is probably the most useful applications of blockchains I have seen so far. Filecoin is another interesting use of blockchains: a cryptocurrency used for paying for data storage, with verifiable storage replacing the \"proof of work\" of bitcoin.\nAs for hash collisions, you never seem to find another reply than the theoretical estimations of their very low probability. I doubt anyone knows how likely they are in practice for real data, but IPFS is a real-life experiment to find out. I also wonder about the possibility of hash-collision-based DOS attacks, such a massively injecting random data into IPFS. For now I am looking at IPFS merely out of curiosity, so it's not a reason to worry.\nOne advantage of IPFS is that its hash algorithm is not baked in. If SHA256 turns out to be insufficient, they can switch to something else without abandoning existing data."
