I post the whole text here to read: “The modern operating system only implemented 2 metaphors for builders to extend: the file and the application. <br/>What if they also implemented “event”, “place”, “person”, “feed” abstractly: letting tools that the user invites into their life collaboratively extend those core connected metaphors as well? <br/>My operating system should understand that “Messenger” is a medium by which I “send” “messages” to “people” and that would allow it to join messages to a person across all mediums. <br/>Instead every “application” reinvents the same metaphors over and over in incompatible ways. The user doesn’t want applications, they want extensions. <br/>An “application” invents metaphors to manipulate, whereas an “extension” extends them. 9/10 apps I use should be extensions to metaphors the operating system provides. <br/><br/> <br/>Maybe builders and tools should be able to present extendable metaphors to the operating system. This is an interesting idea Web3 is doing. NFTs are not in the ethereum spec, they were implemented later by people but then shared — the ERC721 token standard is a “metaphor”. <br/>But honestly, I’m not as interested in this yet. Common, open, shared metaphors for “person”, “place”, “event”, “message”, and “relationship” would move us so far forward before even considering the long tail of remaining metaphors. <br/>I’d love to see @Apple and @Microsoft build these metaphors into their products. Consider iOS 15’s focus modes, it’s great I can own &amp; control my digital experience by writing rules about who can reach me when I’m in “work mode”, but those rules don’t work. <br/>They don’t work because the iPhone, the smartest device in the world, doesn’t comprehend that a phone number and a SnapChat account could possibly represent the same person. Contacts isn’t an application, it’s a metaphor that other tools and services need to extend. <br/>The water is muddy with Apple because they will always want their first party experiences to perform better than third party ones because that’s how they sell devices. That’s sad. <br/>Your operating system should be incentivized to be the layer of metaphors, and then apps and extensions arrive to make those metaphors useful and bring them to life. <br/>I mentioned Web3 earlier, that’s not the solution here. Web3 implements some fascinating metaphors around identity, governance, and currency; but, the solutions here need to be faster, more private, and be more customizable. <br/><br/> <br/>Or maybe Web3 is a movement that encompasses building common metaphors regardless of implementation — and blockchain is just the first platform of many that will be used to that end. That’s a fascinating prospect. <br/>In the end, though, the point I want to convey is that applications should collaboratively extend common metaphors to enrich my life, not incompatibly recreate the wheel over and over and over. “ <a href="https://twitter.com/adamtowerz/status/1443505907208392707">https://twitter.com/adamtowerz/status/1443505907208392707</a>

Twitters take at web3 or these metaphors is blue sky and Kei kreutler has this nice piece about “inventories not identities” <a href="https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1443894493057519628?s=21">https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1443894493057519628?s=21</a>

Modern OSes like Android and iOS do that, no? Contacts, events, messages, phone call, location and much more are OS level concepts, or am I misunderstanding?

Hi :wave: <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Denny Vrandečić</span>  cleaning up misunderstandings is not that simple on that level.  For some context did you read kei piece on : inventories not identities?

I had read it a few months ago, and now looked through it again, yes.

Now that you mention it there seems to be a kind of  grumpy critique about how certain tech companies handle/use their monopiies in this" The water is muddy with Apple because they will always want their first party experiences to perform better than third party ones because that’s how they sell devices. That’s sad.<br/>Your operating system should be incentivized to be the layer of metaphors, and then apps and extensions arrive to make those metaphors useful and bring them to life." would you agree?

yes, agree with that. Modern OSes should be that, in addition to their traditional task
