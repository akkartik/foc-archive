        "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nMy name is Miguel Rochefort. I'm a software developer from Montr√©al, Canada. I've been traveling around Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Bali) for the past 6 months out of my 21-liter backpack.\n\nI initially got into programming at age 10, when I built my first websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). At 12, I started played with Python and C++. At 16, it was Visual Basic and PHP. At 18, I started learning C#, which has been my main language for the past 10 years. I then discovered Haskell, Prolog, Lisp, Smalltalk, ML, Agda, Idris, Coq, Mercury, Eve, etc. That's when I got hooked on programming language design.\n\nMy main influences are Bret Victor, Alan Kay, Douglas Engelbart, Chris Granger, Ted Nelson, Tim Berners Lee, Jef Raskin, Steve Jobs, Stephen Wolfram, Charles Simonyi, David Allen, Mathias Duarte, etc. If I could travel back in time, I would go to Xerox PARC.\n\nThe current state of software is a mess. The incidental complexity is unbelievable. Nothing changed in the past 40 years. We must have reached a local maxima.\n\nHere are some of my heuristics for the future of programming:\n\n- Using software and creating software should feel the same.\n- 80% of people should be able to program without any formal training.\n- You should be productive when programming on a 5\" phone (but the optimal interface should be VR or R).\n- Programming should not involve text files and syntax.\n- Programming by example (with direct manipulation) should be the dominant paradigm (WYSIWYG, TDD, ML dataset, Excel's Flash Fill).\n- The distinction between natural language, programming language and graphical user interface should disappear.\n- Programming is mainly a modeling problem.\n- Designing and implementing GUI by hand doesn't scale (especially once responsive design considers all of a user's preferences) and should be automated (e.g., Naked Objects).\n- The code to invoke a user (GUI) and the code to invoke a machine (API) should be identical.\n- Every function\/predicate\/model ever created should be instantly available to everyone.\n- Mechnical turks and AI functions should be as easy to call as a local function.\n- Fuzzy\/bayesian values (e.g., \"integer between 0 and 18\") should be first class citizens, and automatically turn any deterministic functions into a fuzzy\/probabilistic functions.\n- Strings should be avoided, and semantically richer types\/ontologies (Email, PhoneNumber, Password, Country) should be used instead.\n\nRight now, I'm experimenting with Quantified Self. I'm trying to collect as much information about my life as I can. This starts with IoT devices, wearables, NFC tags, QR codes, cameras, audio recorders, GPS trackers, keyloggers, IFTTT, manual input, etc. Then I have to manually\/automatically classify\/quantify the collected data, to extract computable meaning\/semantics. Ultimately, I can visualize the data, query it, infer new knowledge, make lifestyle changes to affect the output, etc. The idea is that the more we know about a user, the less we need to ask it for input (\"don't make me click\") and the less assumptions about it we need to hard code in our code base. I believe this is the first step to make coding against a user as easy as coding against an API or a database.\n\nI'm looking forward to some great discussions!",

I've been traveling around Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Bali) for the past 6 months out of my 21-liter backpack.\n\nI initially got into programming at age 10, when I built my first websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). At 12, I started played with Python and C++. At 16, it was Visual Basic and PHP. At 18, I started learning C#, which has been my main language for the past 10 years. I then discovered Haskell, Prolog, Lisp, Smalltalk, ML, Agda, Idris, Coq, Mercury, Eve, etc. That's when I got hooked on programming language design.\n\nMy main influences are Bret Victor, Alan Kay, Douglas Engelbart, Chris Granger, Ted Nelson, Tim Berners Lee, Jef Raskin, Steve Jobs, Stephen Wolfram, Charles Simonyi, David Allen, Mathias Duarte, etc. If I could travel back in time, I would go to Xerox PARC.\n\nThe current state of software is a mess. The incidental complexity is unbelievable. Nothing changed in the past 40 years. We must have reached a local maxima.\n\nHere are some of my heuristics for the future of programming:\n\n- Using software and creating software should feel the same.\n- 80% of people should be able to program without any formal training.\n- You should be productive when programming on a 5\" phone (but the optimal interface should be VR or R).\n- Programming should not involve text files and syntax.\n- Programming by example (with direct manipulation) should be the dominant paradigm (WYSIWYG, TDD, ML dataset, Excel's Flash Fill).\n- The distinction between natural language, programming language and graphical user interface should disappear.\n- Programming is mainly a modeling problem.\n- Designing and implementing GUI by hand doesn't scale (especially once responsive design considers all of a user's preferences) and should be automated (e.g., Naked Objects).\n- The code to invoke a user (GUI) and the code to invoke a machine (API) should be identical.\n- Every function\/predicate\/model ever created should be instantly available to everyone.\n- Mechnical turks and AI functions should be as easy to call as a local function.\n- Fuzzy\/bayesian values (e.g., \"integer between 0 and 18\") should be first class citizens, and automatically turn any deterministic functions into a fuzzy\/probabilistic functions.\n- Strings should be avoided, and semantically richer types\/ontologies (Email, PhoneNumber, Password, Country) should be used instead.\n\nRight now, I'm experimenting with Quantified Self. I'm trying to collect as much information about my life as I can. This starts with IoT devices, wearables, NFC tags, QR codes, cameras, audio recorders, GPS trackers, keyloggers, IFTTT, manual input, etc. Then I have to manually\/automatically classify\/quantify the collected data, to extract computable meaning\/semantics. Ultimately, I can visualize the data, query it, infer new knowledge, make lifestyle changes to affect the output, etc. The idea is that the more we know about a user, the less we need to ask it for input (\"don't make me click\") and the less assumptions about it we need to hard code in our code base. I believe this is the first step to make coding against a user as easy as coding against an API or a database.\n\nI'm looking forward to some great discussions!"
