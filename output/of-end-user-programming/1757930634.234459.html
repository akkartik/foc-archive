<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4129683">EUDability: a new construct at the intersection of end-user &hellip;</a><br/>[I don't know why it was so hard for me to wade through this paper, despite being squarely in my interests.<br/>I feel the academic format is a poor match for the content which could be a good blog post?]<br/><br/>The goal is extending "usability" so "use" includes end-user programming.<br/>... They observe that "computational thinking" skills become a "literacy" when practiced, including the experience of when to apply which skill.  [by that stage the paper still feels like a lot of word shuffling]...<br/>The real stuff only comes in pp. 25–27 where they identify qualities ("dimensions") by which the software can <em>help users apply those computational skills</em>:<br/>• <em>Concreteness</em>: this dimension refers to the capability of a EUD environment of presenting concepts and requests in a concrete way, without requiring the user highly-developed abstraction skills;<br/>• <em>Modularity</em>: this dimension regards the availability in a EUD environment of different elements, blocks, modules or similar things, which help end-user developers decompose a problem and identify the pieces that may compose its solution;<br/>• <em>Structuredness</em>: when a EUD environment supports the structuring of a solution in a step-by-step process and facilitates the connections between the input and output of the different steps, it can be considered as having the structuredness property;<br/>• <em>Reusability</em>: when the outcome of a EUD activity can be reused in other situations and possibly shared among different end-user developers, the EUD environment possesses the reusability property;<br/>• <em>Testability</em>: this dimension refers to the capability of testing the outcome of the EUD activity within the EUD environment.<br/>and the payoff is this diagram where everything falls neatly in place:
