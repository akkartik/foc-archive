The \"pre-1996\" list includes LISP - a language from 1958! If we are allowed to reach 40 odd years in the past, then a lot of the 1996 list can be included in a 2020 list. It also oddly _excludes_ C++ from the description; _\"useful incremental improvements on top of the foundational technologies that came before\"_, despite it's name being a literal pun on incrementally improving C.\n\nThe second article, I don't really follow what type of organisation is expected to be producing groundbreaking research. Small software houses making UI widgets? From my understanding, most significant steps forward have come from monopolies, academia, or military. (this is where most of the 1996 list items came out of). He says research can't be done at a startup, so what research is actually being hindered by OSS?\n\nI read a lot of what <@U6KQ2S410> writes, but I can't follow a coherent line of reasoning here.

For example, the term \"Open Source ideology\" only applies to a small fundamentlist group of people, best exemplified by Richard Stallman, who however would loudly protest against the use of the term \"Open Source\" rather than \"Free software\".\n\nThere are various arguments for Open Source, and all of them are valid in some context, but don't adapt well to others. In my own domain, computational science, Open Source is increasingly seen as well aligned with how publicy funded research works, or should work. But that argument doesn't cover Linux, Firefox, or VSCode, to name a few well-known projects with very different social structures behind them.\n\nI see two important aspects in the Open vs. Closed Source debate. <@U6KQ2S410> addresses one of them: lack of incentives for significant innovation.

For example, the term \"Open Source ideology\" only applies to a small fundamentlist group of people, best exemplified by Richard Stallman, who however would loudly protest against the use of the term \"Open Source\" rather than \"Free software\".\n\nThere are various arguments for Open Source, and all of them are valid in some context, but don't adapt well to others. In my own domain, computational science, Open Source is increasingly seen as well aligned with how publicy funded research works, or should work.
