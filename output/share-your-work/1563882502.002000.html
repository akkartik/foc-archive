Hi guys, we are proud to reveal <a href="http://nodes.io">http://nodes.io</a> - a new way to create with code. We have been working together with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nick Nikolov</span> on Nodes at Variable (<a href="http://variable.io">http://variable.io</a>) since 2017. We use it to create interactive installations, visualise data, experiment with generative algorithms, build custom design tools and more. We are currently looking for feedback here, or drop us a line at <a href="mailto:hello@nodes.io">hello@nodes.io</a> if you want to know more. You can read more about the underlying tech and our journey at <a href="http://nodes.io/story/">http://nodes.io/story/</a>

There is no easy way to share it publicly yet as quite a bit of setup is required. This release is a big milestone for us,  allowing us to stop, think and then more forward instead of working on it forever. We have some ideas on what’s next but we want to make that decision based on initial response. How do you see yourself using it?

Excited to see this! This is very close to something that I've been working on in my spare time. I'd be very curious to hear how this handles interactive input, as well as how it handles infinite timelines (ie. how do you use the time node under the hood).<br/><br/>Is it like dataflow (rerender all dependent nodes when you change the inputs), or something else?

I added Nodes to my codex (<a href="https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex">https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex</a>). Upon doing so, I realized that you guys... are like a band from 2009 (eg: Grizzly Bear, Panda Bear, Ponytail, Pens, Braids, Chairs, Cousins, Cub, and of course.. Free Nude Celebs) in your love of totally un-Google-able names (eg: Nodes, Variable). Kudos.

The <a href="http://nodes.io">nodes.io</a> project has achieved a huge amount in just 2 years, and for that you are to be commended. However, the choice of JS as the user language is regrettable, because JS is one of the objectively hardest languages to program in, as it full of traps for the unwary.  I realize that given your ambitious goals and short time window it wasn't possible to consider a different language, but writing and debugging JS is not an easy thing.

I also find JS lacking. I don't like how function dispatch works — it's generally too static, too strict. So I wrote my own JS module system that does function dispatch entirely with string names, and soft-fails silently, so I can be a little more dynamic than JS normally allows. It's very, very good. :wink:

As for nodes, I think the choice of JS is perfect — you're sitting on top of the web platform, and JS is the lingua franca of the web. If someone wants to write in a transpiled language, the "we speak npm" approach to integration should work pretty nicely (albeit missing a bit of liveness, perhaps).<br/><br/>Whereas if they chose any other language, they'd still be generating JS code at the end of the day, but forcing people to understand a bigger surface area — Nodes, the web stack, JS, plus whatever language they chose.

never confuse popularity with merit. COBOL was the #1 language for decades and it was really crappy. Java is the COBOL of our time and similarly lousy. The fact that web browser companies agreed upon JS as the main language doomed the world to billions of lines of flaky code, and gigantic web pages that even today's supercomputers struggle to render quickly. IMHO any next generation system that dumps you back 25 years into JS is not of the future, but something with one foot planted firmly in the past.

JS isn't the language they chose for Nodes. They chose the web platform. JS just happens to be the language you need to sit atop if you're going to target the web. ClojureScript and PureScript and Elm and whatever other "better" web language might be an option for them... still needs to sit atop JS. Even something targeting WASM still needs to speak JS. They could hide the JS from the user of Nodes, but why? That doesn't fit at all with their stated goals.

Also, your critique isn't a critique of Nodes so much as a critique of the web platform. I don't think this is the thread for that conversation. I'd be happy to meet you in #thinking-together for that.

There was never a moment of choice. JS is our everyday language ever since I started variable in 2012. After years of Java/Processing and C++/OpenGL the speed of iteration that WebGL gave me in 2010 (<a href="http://marcinignac.com/projects/nine-point-five/">http://marcinignac.com/projects/nine-point-five/</a>) made me never look back. Tools like <a href="http://www.plask.org">http://www.plask.org</a> and later Electron only accelerated that by covering “desktop app” use cases.<br/><br/>So when we started Nodes it was very much extension of the whole baggage of libraries for data viz (d3.js), 3d graphics (pex) and functional programming / data processing (ramda, <a href="http://thi.ng/umbrella">thi.ng/umbrella</a>) we already used. They all still work in Nodes, something you can’t say about other attempts that tried to reinvent the thing from scratch.<br/><br/>That comes with downsides of course, like the mentioned debugging. Some things like the cable soup problem we managed to mitigate e.g. with react/redux style of state management mixed with more port-to-port data flow. We are planning on writing separate articles on that journey.

JS is an intrinsically fragile language. It is incompatible with all the known research on proving programs correct, which is going on in Academia. I don't mind if it is JS under the hood in order to run in the browser; that is a current requirement (which may be relaxed in the future as WebASM evolves). The two main things that will distinguish the next generation of programming languages is 1) creating an ecosystem of interchangeable parts, and 2) drastically reducing the chance for error by the human programmer, which means both on the front side, by having the compiler make it very difficult to make an error, and also when an error does happen make it trivial to fix it.<br/><br/>If your code doesn't work, it doesn't matter how pretty/fun it was to make. If nobody can understand your work, or you can't easily share it, then the world will continue to accumulate billions of lines of code. There is so much code today, yet it is very hard to use. So many dependencies crop up, that the final size of projects that one would think would be modest can be staggering.<br/><br/>In the regard of interchangeable parts, the software field is way behind the hardware guys. They put in chips all the time that have clear specifications on how they are to be wired up, and they have delivered more than a million to 1 price/performance improvement over the last 25 years. Can software even claim 10:1  improvement over the last 25 years?

<a href="http://nodes.io">nodes.io</a> has done a fantastic job of integrating many underlying technologies into a graphical format. This is to be greatly commended. Compared to another language like Maraca, which cannot do 12 / -3 without getting a compiler error (an indication of its very early stage of completion), <a href="http://nodes.io">nodes.io</a> has been used to make things for paying clients, which is a trial by fire that is a sign of maturity and good coverage. My criticism of using JS as its user facing language is specific to <a href="http://nodes.io">nodes.io</a>, and not a general condemnation of JS. JS is mandatory in 99% of web work, and everyone is either using it directly or transpiling to it. That is the commercial reality of 2019. In coming years that may change of course.  I think the <a href="http://nodes.io">nodes.io</a> product needs a better user facing language else the project will be very blunted in its success. If you put a whole ton of frameworks and graphical aids on top of JS, are you really fixing much? You will be pinned down by the OOP model that is intrinsic to JS. People are using closures constantly in JS nowadays, how on earth are you going to represent that in the data model? Closures are deadly for data flow work because now you have code that has a bundled of data specific to it, and the whole closure is on object on the heap, which is neither code nor data but some fusion. The more fancy concepts you use from an OOP language, the harder it gets to represent it graphically, because the purity of your data / code separation is being muddled. And i haven't mentioned dynamic code which some people like to do, where you build a string of JS and then execute it... there are a lot of people advocating using JS as if it was LISP.  I would say the only major flaw in Filemaker Pro is its lousy user facing language, which is archaic and very clumsy, almost back to HyperTalk in age. The rest of filemaker is fantastic. So the scripting language one picks is incredibly important. Syntax does matter.

One of the things, coming from the Houdini side, is that for anything particularly non-trivial you start to want a faster language for implementing nodes. ie. You can write Houdini nodes in Python, but it's just not fast enough for crunching large amounts of data in a 3d pipeline. Houdini actually has their own vector language called VEX, but it's poorly documented (even if it is fast).<br/><br/>The awesome thing about Node languages is that since the boundaries are clearly defined (inputs and outputs), you could write a node in any language as long as it follows the standard. Think of it like the C calling convention.

Dear Marcin, how about taking these very simple program specs, and trying to implement them in <a href="http://nodes.io">nodes.io</a>; the programs are 1-pagers (i.e. final code would be 150 to 200 words), about as short as an interactive program can be and still do something, and then a comparison can be done apples to apples.<br/><br/>the specs are here:<br/><br/><a href="https://github.com/magicmouse/beads-examples">https://github.com/magicmouse/beads-examples</a>
