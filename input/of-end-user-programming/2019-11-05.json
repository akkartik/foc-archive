This made me ask a different set of questions: 1) What characteristics of spreadsheets are believed to directly contribute to the success of spreadsheets as an end-user programming tool? 2) Has anyone attempted to design a non-spreadsheet-based programming tool by using these characteristics as a roadmap? Regarding question #1, I found this excellent paper at <https:\/\/www.miramontes.com\/writing\/spreadsheet-eup\/>. I haven't found anything else quite like it and was wondering whether anyone here knows of more research like it (I plan to write the authors as well). Regarding question #2, I found lots of projects that explore the programmability of spreadsheet tools, but that's not what I had in mind. Thoughts?",
