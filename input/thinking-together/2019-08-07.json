        "text": "&gt; You see lots of charts showing performance of various benchmarks, which is an obsession about run speed. Given how cheap and omnipresent computers are, the cost of the software development typically dwarfs any cost of execution.\n\nThe suggestion here seems to be that developers are optimizing without reason. Which might be the case or it might not. But in cases where you need to, its often the source of bugs, not *just* because of the programming language, but because optimizations depend on a stronger depth of knowledge concerning the platform. I imagine we have more papers on speed benchmarks because they approach being verifiable, as where studies on human productivity are probably a lot harder to compare.\n\nOn studies though, those that i have read have ranked Clojure very high. Higher then haskell in terms of having less bugs. As it's a lisp, i'm curious if you have any insight into how its doing so well given what i interpret as a somewhat bleak outlook on the LISP family.\n\n&gt; The large pool of people using a language is frankly of very little value much of the time for repair and improvement of a codebase. What help are outside people in updating some complex thing?\n\nThe community produces libraries that general have more well thought out and understandable abstractions. Being able to leverage those libraries and community experience is very valuable too me.",

Higher then haskell in terms of having less bugs. As it's a lisp, i'm curious if you have any insight into how its doing so well given what i interpret as a somewhat bleak outlook on the LISP family.\n\n"
