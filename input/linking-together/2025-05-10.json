Distinct Unix processes can hold references and pass messages to individual objects within each other's memory. They even maintain proper reference counts for GC. And each app's state is fully serializable. Then there is Java's hot reload for live app updates. Users don't have access to those mechanisms only because nobody bothered to build a UI yet. But the smalltalk-style OO\/Unix OS not only already exists but is the most popular one out there."
