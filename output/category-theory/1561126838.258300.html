<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Alan Johnson</span> Good list.<br/><br/>– There may even be an arrow A → C, that isn't the composition of an arrow A → B with an arrow B → C.  These sorts of qualities are what give a category its categorical structure.  Given an arrow like with and an arrow like that, does there exist an arrow that relates to them in some special way?<br/><br/>– Yes, many arrows on a single object.  When monoids and groups are treated as categories, they have <b>one</b> categorical object with each element of the group being a morphism, the identity element as the identity morphism, and the binary operator as composition.  And yes, identities end up being unique.  <a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Identity_Morphism_is_Unique">https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Identity_Morphism_is_Unique</a>  I misspoke earlier.<br/><br/>– id ∘ id = id.
