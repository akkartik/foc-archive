What do you guys think of VR ? I think VR will kill web in the next 20 years. Social networks and forums will be replaced by something like Mozilla Hub. Blogs and e-commerce would be replaced by virtual shops and pamphlets. On the developer’s end Visual programming and design could be more intuitive in VR <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rwYiINE9RE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rwYiINE9RE</a>

VR is exciting in many ways but my personal feeling is that it’s not happening any time soon (minus some specific use cases like entertainment, video games, etc). The 2 main barriers IMO are interfaces and hardware.<br/><br/><b>Interfaces</b><br/>Most apps don’t even use most of the power of current PC computing super well. The common pattern seems to be to use ~500MB to show lists of data. But outside of games and some creative tools, most apps don’t even use 2D / 3D space that well. VR is even harder to design for (we’re still in the phase of people designing mice / keyboard in VR environment, similar to how film started out as just recordings of plays).<br/><br/><b>Hardware</b><br/>The hardware is still super clunky (my bias!) and hard to use, even for a gaming enthusiast / nerd like me! I think ultimately the general culture is also slowly starting to get skeptical of the idea of further escaping into cyber space instead of embracing ‘the real world’. Hence why I think AR may be more attainable than VR, but that’s also very challenging for many reasons (both hardware + interfaces).<br/><br/>I think as it stands, VR to me hasn’t provided enough compelling examples of what it’s doing better than traditional desktop / laptop interfaces. Most of the demos I’ve seen are still just scaled up versions of desktop apps.<br/><br/>But maybe if someone created a non-textual, spatial, audio interface for some important ‘jobs to be done’ in VR … that could at least rely on the interface ship to compel people to deal with the hardware issues / limitations!

I feel there are insurmountable problems with current VR tech for many users (puking, basically). My friends who run a successful studio working on VR experiences have to take Dramamine to avoid motion sickness at the office, for example.<br/><br/>AR, though, looks to me like a very ripe area for research in collaborative tools!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Srini K</span> My biggest gripe with the current hardware is cost and setup. I just want a 50$ VR headgear to work as an alternate to my monitor by plugging it into the usb jack. The kernel should directly send the monitor data to VR. I  want to use my existing keypad and mouse as is.

thats another thing that irks me, every new hardware platform is sooo attached to existing stuff. VR headsets are still very PC dependent (I know you can now use them standalone but still its in a more limited standalone way AFAIK)

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@xyzzy</span> well if you have $500 then Oculus Quest 2 with (Air)Link works like that (when it works). You can stream your desktop or jump to any WebXR project running on your PC. I'm using my own <a href="http://Nodes.io">Nodes.io</a> for development so i was able to modify and recompile parts of app live without taking the headset off. ..and then i never did it again due to connection issues, browser wanting to upgrade, blind keyboard typing being hard etc.<br/><br/>The cool thing is Pass Through support for apps is apparently coming to Oculus so you will be able to see your room (and keyboard). So while AR being 80% real and 20% virtual (full of tracking alignment problems), having VR+camera at 20% real and 80% virtual might be sweet spot!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Marcin Ignac</span> The streaming quality is very poor at the moment, not to mention slow. Thats why I want it to work in the kernel directly as a display driver. I think gloves with finger sensors and some sorta key sensors can fix the keyboard location problem. I love the VR interface for movie watching but  desktop streaming doesn’t cut it for everyday  use. We should have had this by now!

There should be a niche product that addresses this market... But your request for having it be $50 means maybe there shouldn't be because there is no way it can be profitable. Like can you buy a new 24" LCD for $50 even, lol

And the compositor living in the OS which, although it unfortunate VR devices are tied to game stores on PC, I don't think would actually make a huge difference. I'm not sure if WMR runs in kernel space. Probably unlikely because Windows runs graphics drivers (in general) in user space

Too many messages :slightly_smiling_face: I just saw a video of facebook’s scripting language. It seems to be a scratch derivate. Neat. Checkout the video posted by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@J. Ryan Stinnett</span> .. thats exactly what I want with plug and play, just like monitors. From the youtube comments you can see that plenty of people want the exact same thing. One a side note I don’t like notion that everything has to be fit into the mass market. I would be perfectly happy with the initial cardboard model where people were building their own vr headgear.

I think that CLI is the future, and I'm only half-joking.<br/><br/>I tend to think that, as people get more accustomed to computing, they will be increasingly find spatial/graphical interfaces cumbersome and start preferring more abstract interfaces, just like programmers. Today's average PC users are already familiar with abstract notions like file formats, cookies or 2FA. I think this tendency will accelerate and CLI-like interface will come back as a dominant style in future.

But more seriously, VR actually connects use more closely with our bodies than any other form of computing. There is a reason why fitness is one of the larger growth areas in VR. This comment seems guided by an idea of VR rather than the reality of current hardware. Arguably VR does heavily disconnect you from the world but it doesn't have to. That might start to get into XR spectrum, where does VR end and AR begin, etc debates though

I understand it's not a standard approach, so it appears complicated. But in order to use my monitor effectively I still have to install GPU drivers (I understand that depending on your use case that might not be true). People often use coded language with VR to describe one thing, when they actually mean something else. So "not plug in play" could actually mean setup is easy, but the existing UX for interacting with traditional 2D applications is insufficient (which I agree with). This was my point that it's not just a monitor. In that sense even a monitor isn't just a monitor. You're working with decades of UX designed to make the monitor work and input systems designed to work with it. VR does have decades of research behind it, but modern consumer VR is only 5 years old...

Facebook is not relevant anymore. I think Snapchat, VRChat, Twitch, Discord are the new “cool” places to be. One unique advantage of VR could be a less crowded social network, where you presumably can punch people too.  Facebook was already dead the moment they were no longer trying to do anything innovative but just trying to be relevant by mergers and acquisition like WhatsApp, Instagram and  Oculus and fake expansion into other countries just to increase vanity metrics. When a company starts copying its competitors, you know that mbas have taken over the management.

WMR is probably closest to fitting your criteria. Realistically you probably need Steam or MS Store to actually get apps, but I guess you could side load everything and have no explicit launcher or new store login. You can side load though. <br/><br/><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/set-up-windows-mixed-reality">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/enthu&hellip;</a><br/><br/>Wayland has a XR compositor called WXRC.

Checking in after being preoccupied... two thoughts:<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Scott Anderson</span> is spot on with "VR device being just a monitor" being a bad idea.  I really, really hope that medium appropriate spacial affordances are developed before the hardware becomes good enough to easily read small text.  Nothing will disappoint me more than us settling for the projection of innumerable 80x24 terminal windows.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jack Rusher</span> makes a good point with "insurmountable problems with current VR tech ... motion sickness."  Despite strongly preferring VR to AR, I can wear a HoloLens comfortably for a lot longer than a Quest.  Long term, I would feel better about an operating system that guarantees frame rate rather than relying on experience** developers.<br/><br/><b></b> Can't bring myself to use the word "app."
