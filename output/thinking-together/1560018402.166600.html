on the topic of visual programming languages: can we just acknowledge for a minute that even textual programming languages ARE extremely visual? whether it's sticking things inside parentheses, function arguments, indentation, the glyph % for modulus, or using the same syntax for structuring/destructuring data by switching the right hand side to the left hand side, programming languages use visual thinking all the time—they're just using a pretty impoverished medium<br/><br/> it might even be true that visual/positional reasoning is necessary in any formal language since the rules for what terms can follow or include each other require positional rules, not just grammatical ones<br/><br/>I think there's a pretty fruitful zone of research on more compact visual representations that look more like glyphs and less like diagrams—since diagrams are usually used for conceptual overviews rather than the nitty-gritty of how stuff gets done. something along the lines of sparkcharts or the variety of icons used in games (whether mana symbols in magic the gathering, HUDs in first person shooters for stuff like ammo and energy, or resource count icons in real-time strategy games.
