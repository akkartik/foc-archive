Pictured: the equivalent of this WebPPL model<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">var clamp = function(num) {<br/>  return num > 2 ? 2 : num<br/>}<br/>clamp(sum(repeat(3, function() {<br/>  return flip()<br/>})))</pre><br/><b>What's new this time? User-defined functions!</b> There's one anonymous, single-use function at the top (the one that's passed to <tt>repeat()</tt>), and a function named <tt>clamp</tt> below that's written to be reused. <b>Functions = Boxes.</b> Lu took lines, but I think boxes are still available.<br/><br/><b>The writeup is here: <a href="http://alltom.com/pages/ppl-lab-notebook/005.html">http://alltom.com/pages/ppl-lab-notebook/005.html</a></b> If you want to know the whys and the hows, it's for you. I <em>love</em> how the lab notebook / experiment writeup format gives me places to hang all the random things I'd like to write about. Design vicariously with me. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>(Even if you don't have the time to read the writeup, I want you to know that I <em>do not like</em> how the clamp function's source code looks. I'm not done. But I decided a few entries back that I was going to dump all the LEGO bricks onto the floor where I could see them before I started picking the ones I wanted in my spaceship.)
