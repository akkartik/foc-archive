Hello people,<br/>I found this community while searching for people who are into Flow-Based Programming projects. I am working on a DSL to build up my own FBP over Kotlin. One of the main problems with FBP I faced so far is "Performance Issues". Since you are dealing with some way of communication among the blocks of codes (typically a protocol over socket). I wonder how others see FBP as a general purpose way of coding  while dealing with it's disadvantages like performance issues.
