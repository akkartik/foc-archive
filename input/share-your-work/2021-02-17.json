I'm imagining a layer of code which has API\/TUI entry points and that the GUI is built on top of. Then everything below the GUI is easily composable with other programs (esp testing), and the GUI happens to be a nice way to make it easy to interact with the program.\n\nI'm not sure why it matters if there are exceptions to the rule. If you're going to hold a simple rule, it's better to err on the side of silence than on the side of noise. Should you hold a simple rule?

The Art Of Unix Programming completely changed my view of eng design.\n\nI'm imagining an architecture where the GUI can be modularized out. It doesn't need to be a separate process or anything. I'm imagining a layer of code which has API\/TUI entry points and that the GUI is built on top of. Then everything below the GUI is easily composable with other programs (esp testing), and the GUI happens to be a nice way to make it easy to interact with the program.\n\nI'm not sure why it matters if there are exceptions to the rule. If you're going to hold a simple rule, it's better to err on the side of silence than on the side of noise. Should you hold a simple rule? I believe so because I've found there's bigger fish to fry."
