I'd love to hear what you and others think of it. This was a summary and conclusion to a series of my posts here in #devlog-together.

Yes some parts resonated with me. It reminded me of my own notes which I kept private. Looking forward to find a opportunity to exchange on these ideas.

Interesting notes!<br/><br/>First reaction: the title says "how" but not "what". I think the two go together by necessity. If you first decide, in the abstract, <em>how</em> you want to program, you end up constraining <em>what</em> you can program. Which is fine, of course, if you are aware of it and give priority to methodology. And I like reading about such approaches because my own is almost the opposite: start from <em>what</em> and then figuring out <em>how</em>.<br/><br/>Another surprise for me is the focus on "a program", meaning a relatively autonomous unit of software. In the context of situated software, which I am also a big fan of, this looks like an unwelcome constraint. My own tendency at the moment is the opposite: build extensions/plugins to frameworks such as Glamorous Toolkit (or my own Common Lisp inspector framework) to profit from their affordances and keep the problem-specific code small. But then, this means accepting large dependencies. In terms of durability, a "program" is probably the better bet.<br/><br/>The nine-point synthesis is very interesting. Points 1-3 agree with my own experience. Also 5 and 6. Point 4 is one reason why I like building on a framework: it makes experimentation cheaper (see point 7!). At the cost of durability. Tough trade-off.<br/><br/>Point 9 reminds me of Gilbert Simondon's "The mode of existence of technical objects". He considers a technical object mature when it no longer resembles independent parts bolted together. A single design taking into account everything all at once.
