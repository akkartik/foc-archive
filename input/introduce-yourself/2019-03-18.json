But I can try to give a quick summary here.\n\nFor the cellular boundary formula its not much. I'm essentially identifying a (conceptually) useful abstraction for this one proof and visually implementing that abstraction. That abstraction is grouping together a set of isomorphic objects for each natural number n and keeping track of the isomorphisms between them. The implementation consists of forming a new commutative diagram whose vertices\/objects are now these systems of isomorphic objects and whose morphisms are now identified by specifying a particular morphism from one object of the domain system to an object of the codomain system. So now the commutative diagram reads: the map whose degree we want to take is the inclusion into the relative homology, followed by the boundary homomorphism followed by the projection onto the factor we want. This is roughly how we would understand the birds eye view of the original proof but neither this nor all the details are directly visible in the original.\n\nFor spectral sequences the representation is only a bit more substantial but the math is more difficult. For the spectral sequence of a filtered complex (of vector spaces) every vector space we will consider is uniquely isomorphic to a sub quotient of the original complex, that is, a quotient of a subspace. The relevant subspaces that we take and quotient by are linearly ordered so they can be placed on a line and then each sub quotient corresponds to a unique sub length of this line. For example if we have a filtered complex like 0=K_0 \\subset K_1 \\subset K_2 \\subset K_3= *full complex* we can put K_0 on the line at 0, K_1 on the line at 1, K_2 on the line at 2 and K_3 at the line at three (and just have the line go from 0 to 3). Then the sub quotient K_2\/K_1 would correspond to the length of line going from 1 to 2 and H_*(K_2\/K_1), being a sub quotient of K_2\/K_1, would be signified by a smaller length line, say from 1.2 to 1.7, for a concrete mental image (although there really isn't any basis for those or any specific numbers aside from being between 1 and 2). Also in practice I would use the span from 1 to 2 for H_*(K_2\/K_1) because I would rarely consider K_2\/K_1 in and of itself. This is essentially what is depicted in the first picture although we are looking at H_* of a subquotient further down, namely E_{p,q}^{r-1}. Most of the sub quotients we consider are triply indexed so its a daunting task to follow the logic for the proofs of the main theorems in a single presentation let alone get a birds eye view of it all. Its the common canvas that every development of spectral sequences paints over so I can naturally compare and contrast different approaches; I can see every development occurring simultaneously\/in the same visual space. Its a really cool thing! In the second picture we see two more of the same “canvases” where the small horizontal lines indicate the subquotients we are looking at and the arrows are the morphisms in the long exact sequences relating each of the subquotients.\n\nAs I'm working to extend these techniques to representing the computation of the homology of RP^2 I'm more inspired by Bret's BART Widget than any one thing in Kill Math, since Kill Math is mostly about quantitative stuff and the widget is about this complicated highly relational thing.

Its just people personally reporting how they think right? Its definitely not an either-or thing for me and I'd have a hard time even saying if I favor one way of thinking over another. It depends so much on the subject and how familiar I am with the material. I think most people are guided by the visual\/kinesthetic channels for thinking but need the symbolic channels for doing rigorous math. Math is at its best imo when the symbolic and visual forms are in harmony - when the visual forms guide symbolic thinking and the symbolic forms clarify our mental images. Some parts of math are visually impoverished so to make the most out of the little visualization there is, we have to pay closer attention to the symbolic forms.\n\nI guess thats really where my thinking is at, the parts of math that are nearly impenetrable to visual understanding, and how can you make the best of that situation. I believe things can be vastly improved here but I probably shouldn't begin that rant now.",

Its just people personally reporting how they think right? Its definitely not an either-or thing for me and I'd have a hard time even saying if I favor one way of thinking over another. It depends so much on the subject and how familiar I am with the material. I think most people are guided by the visual\/kinesthetic channels for thinking but need the symbolic channels for doing rigorous math. Math is at its best imo when the symbolic and visual forms are in harmony - when the visual forms guide symbolic thinking and the symbolic forms clarify our mental images. Some parts of math are visually impoverished so to make the most out of the little visualization there is, we have to pay closer attention to the symbolic forms.\n\nI guess thats really where my thinking is at, the parts of math that are nearly impenetrable to visual understanding, and how can you make the best of that situation. I believe things can be vastly improved here but I probably shouldn't begin that rant now."
