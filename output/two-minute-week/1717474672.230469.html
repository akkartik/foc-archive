I made a project to have lots of concepts explained in Gleam tours. Gleam runs in the browser and server so I think that this might be a good platform to explain a lot of things. I've been showing Gleam to non programmers and they mostly "get it" as long as there is no installation, editor setup, deployment to worry about. My current though for the future of code is that no-code might be less important that no-ops.<br/><a href="https://vimeo.com/953263666?share=copy">https://vimeo.com/953263666?share=copy</a>
