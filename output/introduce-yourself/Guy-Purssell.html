Hi! I'm Guy, a software engineer from and based in London. I'm interested in expressive and joyful applications of software directed at making music, algorithmic poetry and other creative forms. In my day job I work on interactive music learning sites - I can share links if there's interest (am mindful that the guidelines suggest to not talk too much about the company you're working for), and have in the past worked in data vis and creative technologist roles. On the side I enjoy using tools like Max MSP to explore ideas in the interests I mentioned above. I appreciated the sound of this community - the ethos really resonated with me and am curious to dig in!
