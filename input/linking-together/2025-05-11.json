Please @bonfire@indieweb.social, tell me if this explanation is correct or not. Also, @jerrej@mastodon.social and @ghosttie@mastodon.gamedev.place, please tell me if it made it clearer to you what Bonfire is.\n\n“Bonfire Apps is a suite of community building apps that connect with the wider fediverse. One of the apps is Bonfire Social, a microblogging software much like Mastodon. Another one is Bonfire Community, which lets communities discuss in groups and topics. The apps are all open source and lets users host their own instance or join an existing one. \n\nThe Bonfire Apps are built by the online collective Bonfire Networks. To sustain development they offer Mosaic, a service that sets up tailored digital spaces.\n\nLastly, Bonfire is also a flexible framework for building fully custom community tools.”\n\nHere is a demo instance of Bonfire Social:\n<https:\/\/campground.bonfire.cafe\/>\n\nRead more about the rest of the apps here:\n<https:\/\/bonfirenetworks.org\/apps\/>\n\n@jaz@mastodon.iftas.org @ghosttie@mastodon.gamedev.place",
