Hey folks, great to be here - it’s a joy to find such a forward thinking, open-minded community. Looking forward to taking a bit more of an active part.<br/><br/>I’ve been working with Clojure, and especially Datomic where I can, for the last few years, with small forays into iOS and (slightly larger excursions) web applications. FP, structural editing and s-expressions are my happy place, mashed up with abusing browsers and CSS to do occasionally surprising things. I amuse myself with generative art pieces when I have time, using quil and trying to keep up with some of <a href="https://www.tylerxhobbs.com/">Tyler Hobbs</a>’ excellent examples. <a href="https://www.owenschuh.com/">Owen Schuh</a> is another favourite - really love his work. Suggestions for more brain food are always welcome!
