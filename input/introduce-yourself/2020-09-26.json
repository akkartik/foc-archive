So:\n&gt; tell us about your background\nOriginally I got into coding through film. I was preparing for auditions for my first feature. Upon posting a casting notice online I got over 4000 submissions. I had hardly any $$ so I couldn’t hire casting agents or assistants. At that time I started to dabble in coding, mostly making small games like battleship. I realized I could use google sheets + gscript (JS-like scripting around gsuite products) to send emails. I exported all actors data into a CSV, imported it into sheets, rated actors based on their video reels and fit for the role.\nThen wrote a 80 line script that sent them personalized emails in which, if their rating was high, they’d be invited to a scheduled audition and when low to an open call. The emails were signed by a made up person “Janina Kebera - Production Office Assistant.” I hacked on the script for 3 days, then pressed a button and it sent 4000+ emails in less than a second.\nI got 20 responses in 2 minutes, 40 in 5. I ended up doing the auditions but never the movie. My experience with it was so impactful, I decided to pursue coding instead.\nSince then I made <https:\/\/hackernoon.com\/a-learnable-world-20ee8da4690a|Vimsical>, <https:\/\/github.com\/den1k\/root|root>, genetic algorithms for CSS, trading algorithms, <https:\/\/theshopgrid.com\/|GRID> and a <https:\/\/roamresearch.com\/#\/app\/dennis\/page\/oq8QVA0Sq|few other projects>.\n\n&gt; what your interests are\nWhile learning about genetic algorithms I stumbled upon the concept of fitness functions and made my own. It’s _“have fun and be curious.”_ This gets me around.\n\n&gt; how you got into computer futurism\nI don’t know if I have. I think we got ahead of ourselves. The future lies in the past.\n\nhow you found the Slack\n&gt; I got introduced to Steve Krouse in the early days of FoC\ninteresting hobbies\n&gt; only code makes it online :wink: so here’s my <https:\/\/github.com\/den1k|github>\nReally love skimming through the posts here. People are up to amazing stuff! Feedback is constructive, people help providing context through links etc. Thanks everyone and especially <@UC2A2ARPT> for all your hard work on FoC.",
