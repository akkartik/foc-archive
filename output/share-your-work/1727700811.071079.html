Hi everyone! I just made <a href="../introduce-yourself/1727700801.324929.html">my introduction</a> and promised a glimpse of our work. We (the <a href="https://www.kendra.io">Kendraio</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kendraio_kendraio-kendraioapp-interoperability-activity-7199366975783858177-3vKL">team</a>) are currently experimenting with no-code, local-first and malleable-software isms.<br/><br/>We want to create a local environment where it is really easy for end-users and non-developers to build workflows and manage their own data, whilst also being able to plug into the services (apps and websites) that they currently use and build their own user-interfaces for those services. It's a big dream and we've started small.<br/><br/>A few years ago during the pandemic we built a <a href="https://app.kendra.io/kendraio/coronavirus">dashboard for COVID-19 data</a>. Our Flow plugged into various APIs and then visualised the received data on one page â€“ so a good demonstration of one aspect of our dream. The dashboard still exists but shows historical data. We wrote an <a href="https://medium.com/kendraio/covid-19-kendraio-creates-coronavirus-dashboard-within-kendraio-app-a0185e526b25">article</a> about the dashboard which also has an accompanying <a href="https://youtu.be/OD_SN99Sy8Q">video</a> explaining how it works and how you can edit the Flow while it's running.<br/><br/>Enjoy! Look forward to any comments or questions. Cheers!
