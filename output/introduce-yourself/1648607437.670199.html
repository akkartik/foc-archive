Greetings, ah, Earthlings<br/><br/>My name is Ryan, I caught on to this community via the podcast episode with Ella Hoeppner, the generative art in particular caught my attention.<br/><br/>My background is in astronomy, I previously worked at the VLA and on JWST (glad THAT one went well). These days I do a lot of software development with image processing and computer vision.<br/><br/>I've been working on an image-based personal search engine for about 4 years now. I didn't know at the time I started it, but it's sorta kinda... very much like Vannevar Bush's Memex. It is a commercial project - happy to share it if that's appropriate.<br/><br/>Outside of that, I've been making a lot of tiny programs lately - a webpage that <a href="https://foxrow.com/wordle">always shows me yesterday's wordle</a>, a random-background-wallpaper-grabber (feels like getting a new computer!), putting <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">this data tracking technique</a> by Simon Willison (of Django fame) into practice.<br/><br/>Glad to be here, and I'm happy to chat if any of that sounds interesting!
