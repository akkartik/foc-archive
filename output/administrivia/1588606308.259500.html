o I'm not interested in solutions aimed at techies, which is most of the content here<br/>o Fewer channels definitely, yes<br/>o For that reason, amongst others<br/>o And that<br/>o don't think that's an issue - it's kinda obvs that an EUP channel will have that strong bias so "contradict and expect some pushback"<br/>o Luv me a flame war :smile: but I think most people respect each other's position and don't want to waste time and energy on that, just want to get on with doing their thing<br/>o #thinking-together would do that, and is indeed <em>great</em>
