Hi all, I'm Nodar. I've been generally aware of the future of code (now feeling of computing) for a couple of years now but only just now got around to joining the Slack. My first coding experience was in HyperCard in the late 90s. Now days for development and personal work I'm terminal/keyboard focused over GUIs (or at least point &amp; click, mouse-oriented input), but still develop GUIs for end users, and for myself I still carry a deep interest in better interfaces, and their ability to reduce the friction and bandwidth between thought and computation.<br/><br/>Particularly interested in the evolution of ideas around literate programming, and also ways of extending the computational notebook paradigm.
