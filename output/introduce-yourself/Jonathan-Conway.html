Hello all! I’ve been hanging around this community since I attended the first London meetup, so it’s probably about time I introduced myself. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>I’m an Australian software developer currently working as a contractor in London and looking forward to working in other global cities in the future. Was fortunate enough to discover computers around age 12, got my first paid development job at 15 (couldn’t believe that I could get paid to do something I already enjoy!) and never looked back. Worked with various languages, projects and stacks. These days it’s Typescript, Javascript, Rx and C#. Maybe (hopefully!) Scala in the near future.<br/><br/>My formal education is a bit scant, but I’ve reading up and doing courses here and there. Some books I really enjoyed were ‘A Philosophy of Software Design’ (Outsterhout), ‘Code Complete’ (McConnel) and ‘Design Patterns’ (GOF). And this community has also been a fount of resources.<br/><br/>I constantly feel like a beginner with software, and maybe it’ll be that way for life, but I still want to advance my knowledge.<br/><br/>I’m especially interested in the craft of coding, the construction of software and systems and the intersection of design and programming. My biggest weakness is fear &amp; ignorance of math, but I’m slowly chipping away at that.<br/><br/>I’m very fond of certain kinds of music that have a systematic and/or cyclic element to them. I especially love the symphonies of Anton Bruckner, which seem to have an organic complexity and depth that I get totally lost in.<br/><br/>Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> &amp; <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> and all of you. Let’s get it started in here! B-)
