It’s easy to be distracted by the possibilities of AR and VR in “true” 3D, although there is still so much more to explore in 2D (2.5D?) space.\n\nZooming is one of those interactions deeply rooted in the way we think. It has an embodied physicality to it, which provides a powerful metaphor that most people understand intuitively. This is why the touch gestures for it (pinch to zoom) are so easily remembered. \n\nI’m sure there are many more ways for us to build upon the patterns (kinesthetic image schemas) that provide the underpinnings for most of our linguistic reasoning and build interfaces with them that can truly be “intuitive”.",

        "text": "Warning: shower thoughts lie ahead.\n\nI've been struck with the nagging thought that maybe \"FoC\" general-purpose languages (targeting extreme accessibility) have to be designed in such a way that they can run on (modern) GPUs rather than just CPUs. Even integrated GPUs nowadays have a minimum of 200-400 general purpose cores (albeit with a slant towards certain operations). We don't really know how to use those cores effectively for general purpose tasks because we're normally trying to program them using a C dialect (e.g. via CUDA, OpenCL, GLSL...). It's the same problem we have with multicore CPUs: writing massively-parallelizable code in an imperative language is (too) challenging, and we've known for decades that we'll need to solve the problem eventually, since parallelization is the only way to scale computation once we're building circuits out of individual atoms.\n\nOnly languages based on constructs that are implicitly parallelizable are going to be able to target GPUs effectively whilst remaining highly accessible. The alternative is to ask the user to explicitly divide their computation up into parallelizable work units (threads\/actors), which is an immediate complexity trap. Programmer-led task division doesn't scale, and it's a deep rabbit hole that can require a PhD to be done effectively.\n\nSome people might argue that parallelization is a performance optimization and that most end-user apps don't need it, but I think there are many occasions where the ceiling of what's possible is just too low to offer a bright future. There are always occasions where someone comes up with a need like \"I want to process this entire spreadsheet \/ note collection \/ webpage\" or \"I want to make a picture\" or \"I want to do a simulation \/ animation of my idea\", and they want that processing to be interactive (implying instantaneous), at which point most serial languages can't handle what's being asked for.\n\nSo, must a new generation of accessible programming languages be based on implicitly parallelizable constructs and 400 cores? The hardware APIs we need (Vulkan, WebGPU...) are finally becoming available. We just need to utilize them half-decently.",

Even integrated GPUs nowadays have a minimum of 200-400 general purpose cores (albeit with a slant towards certain operations). We don't really know how to use those cores effectively for general purpose tasks because we're normally trying to program them using a C dialect (e.g. via CUDA, OpenCL, GLSL...). It's the same problem we have with multicore CPUs: writing massively-parallelizable code in an imperative language is (too) challenging, and we've known for decades that we'll need to solve the problem eventually, since parallelization is the only way to scale computation once we're building circuits out of individual atoms.\n\nOnly languages based on constructs that are implicitly parallelizable are going to be able to target GPUs effectively whilst remaining highly accessible. The alternative is to ask the user to explicitly divide their computation up into parallelizable work units (threads\/actors), which is an immediate complexity trap. Programmer-led task division doesn't scale, and it's a deep rabbit hole that can require a PhD to be done effectively.\n\nSome people might argue that parallelization is a performance optimization and that most end-user apps don't need it, but I think there are many occasions where the ceiling of what's possible is just too low to offer a bright future. There are always occasions where someone comes up with a need like \"I want to process this entire spreadsheet \/ note collection \/ webpage\" or \"I want to make a picture\" or \"I want to do a simulation \/ animation of my idea\", and they want that processing to be interactive (implying instantaneous), at which point most serial languages can't handle what's being asked for.\n\nSo, must a new generation of accessible programming languages be based on implicitly parallelizable constructs and 400 cores? The hardware APIs we need (Vulkan, WebGPU...) are finally becoming available. We just need to utilize them half-decently."

Most of us aren't aiming for portable assembly, rather something confluent with people's ways of thinking about problems.  Many things we want to express are non-strict: you want the computer to help you figure out something, but you don't care the order it computes things in so long as it remains responsive while working."
