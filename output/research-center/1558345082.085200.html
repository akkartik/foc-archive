Well, going back to the example of the UI, Englebart's system was designed to support collaboration between adult knowledge workers, and was intended to make experts more productive. Kay's system was aimed at a single user personal computer suitable for children. When Apple refined the GUI for the Macintosh project, Steve Jobs wanted a single user system, a non-programmable, easy-to-use consumer appliance, the personal computer as toaster. And that became the model for today's graphical user interface.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what modern graphical user interfaces would have looked like if Englebart's vision had dominated, but I use still primarily use the Unix derived CLI, despite how obviously primitive it is visually compared to the GUI, because it's more productive, and because it supports abstraction and automation in ways that Mac-inspired GUIs cannot. The Unix CLI is based on fixed width, mostly ASCII text, and so are the syntaxes of all of the popular programming languages, and that might be related to why I find the CLI indispensable. Englebart's system was based on tree-structured, addressable data structures, and a tiling window manager. There was a conventional keyboard, but you also used a mouse in one hand and a chord keyboard in the other hand for most interaction with the system, when not entering text. The UI was nothing like a Mac-style GUI. And collaboration with remote users was baked in at a fundamental level. I wonder what a programming environment would feel like based on these lost paradigms.
