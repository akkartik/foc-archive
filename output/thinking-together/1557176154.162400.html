whoa wtf, "Yarvin's opinions have been described as racist, with his writings interpreted as supportive of slavery, including the belief that whites have higher IQs than blacks for genetic reasons. Yarvin himself maintains that he is a racist because he doubts that "all races are equally smart," and supports the notion "that people who score higher on IQ tests are in some sense superior human beings". He also describes himself as being an "outspoken advocate for slavery",[8][22] and has argued that some races are more suited to slavery than others.[23]"  That's a level past standard alt-right racism.  Return to slavery justified by IQ tests?

The slavery stuff is more concerning on a practical level, but it doesn’t even fully capture how extreme their beliefs are given that people have expressed the same position in  mainstream (regional?) politics relatively recently in history. My mind was blown when I realized they’re straight up <em>monarchists</em>. I haven’t looked into it but I haven’t heard of Americans advocating for having a king rule the country since right after the revolution. (Yes, a king specifically.)
