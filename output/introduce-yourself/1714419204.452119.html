Hello from Stockholm, Sweden (although I'm originally American). I'm a software engineer / startup founder and I've worked in both big tech and startups/scale-ups, most recently in IoT and cloud backend, but want to get back to sort of my "roots": as a kid, I read about Englebart/Kay/Macintosh team and I fell in love with the vision of <em>personal</em> computing and the belief in the potential of software as a new medium for human thought and expression.  I was one of the first members of Brad Myers' Natural Programming project at CMU HCII as an undergrad, and I worked at Apple as an engineer on the Mac OS X user experience team during the wondrous Steve Jobs era (I worked on every release from Public Beta to 10.6 Snow Leopard).<br/><br/>I loved HyperCard back in the day and I'm interested in anything along that vein, i.e. end-user programming for the masses. I'm also interested in the problem of funding and commercializing work in this space of "future of coding". I want to see more innovation make its way to the real world, not just remain interesting research projects that languish. Currently I'm participating in a global startup incubator program (Antler.co) and open to starting something new.

No, I have not. Thanks for the tip. I'm aware of a few other HyperCard reincarnations, though they also tend to be quite literal in copying HyperCard's look and feel.

Welcome, I'm also in Stockholm (originally British) currently about to start a 6 month break to start working on some tools I've always wanted to exist in this space. Good to have you here
