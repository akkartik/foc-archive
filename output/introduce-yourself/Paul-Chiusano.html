Hi everyone! I'm Paul, one of the creators of the Unison language (<a href="https://unisonweb.org">https://unisonweb.org</a>). Happy to be here!<br/><br/>A while ago I did experimentation with a structured editor for Unison where syntax and even type errors were ruled out by construction. It was neat but it raised a lot of questions about how to make the experience nice enough to actually use for real editing. For Unison, we came up with a very nice way to make codebase-level edits and refactoring without ever going through broken states, but for editing or writing individual definitions, I think it's harder to displace text editing (even though the benefits to doing so are huge).<br/><br/>I've enjoyed following along over the years with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Cyrus Omar</span> work on Hazel and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Eyal Lotem</span>'s work on Lamdu, among others, and glad to see people making more progress on this stuff. The Unison team is looking to pick up this topic of structured editing again soon now that Unison's core language is getting more settled (we're working on getting a non-alpha release of Unison soon). So maybe there will be opportunities to collaborate with folks here. :slightly_smiling_face:
