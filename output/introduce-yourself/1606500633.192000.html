Hi everyone, my name is Fred, I'm 24 and live in the uk.<br/><br/>I've spent the last year obsessively thinking about some crazy idea I had, of representing an application as a graph data structure, in which everything (ui, logic, state, assets, everything) can be boiled down to edges and vertices. I thought this was the basis to do so many interesting things like code generators, low-code type tool, and even the theory behind it. <br/><br/>I never knew that there was a whole active community behind a lot of the ideas I've been thinking about. This has blown me away, made my entire day, even. I've never spoken about this type of stuff to anyone because I never thought anyone would even care, but to see that I was completely wrong is awesome!<br/><br/>Honestly, I haven't worked on my project for ages, after being busied by personal issues, but the past few days going through all the work and information from this community really revitalised something. All of a sudden, it's all I can think about again.<br/><br/>I don't have anything to show yet, but hopefully I'll share progress with you guys soon. I don't really know what else to say in this post, so I'll leave it at that :woman-shrugging:<br/><br/>Good day

I know exactly what you mean by that feeling. That's something a lot of folks feel before they discover that, yes, there are other people out there like them.<br/><br/>I'd love to know — how did you find out about us?

I initially found it months ago, but only looked at it briefly, saved it, then completely forgot about it until I found it again recently.<br/><br/>I did a lot of research on drag n drop editors, graph data structures, code generators, any limited literature I could find (I didn't even know what to search to find current literature) and things of the sort. This lead me here.<br/><br/>To be precise: r/nocode subreddit thread lead me to an interesting post by a user. Clicked on his profile and found another interesting post by him, one of the comments on that post linked to this community.

Neat! I always enjoy hearing about the forking garden paths that lead folks here.
