I think simple chaining comes out quite nicely (e.g. `[1, 2, 3].[v=&gt;&gt; v? + 1].[v=&gt;&gt; v? * 2]`), but yes in your example the nested function calls get somewhat cluttered. I guess this is partly from choosing to prioritise strings as values rather than variables, and hence needing lots of ?s. Do you have a good example from another language that handles nested function calls really nicely? Just to help me think about it.\n2. Yep agree completely, just haven’t worked on it yet!\n3.
