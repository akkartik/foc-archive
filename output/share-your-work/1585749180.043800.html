Hi!<br/>Today we launched Fibery. It is a connected workspace for teams. In a nutshell, you can build your internal tools in Fibery with no-code. It would be great to have a feedback of this super wise community :slightly_smiling_face: <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/fibery-3">https://www.producthunt.com/posts/fibery-3</a>

Do you have a link to a technical writeup or blog post about the making of this tool?

If you mean high level vision, here is it <a href="https://medium.com/fibery/fibery-getting-started-64bd0839c85a">https://medium.com/fibery/fibery-getting-started-64bd0839c85a</a><br/><br/>If you mean technologies behind, then we don’t have it so far. In short it was built on Clojure (core for flexible domain) + Javascript for quite many side services + Postgres (works surprisingly well for flexible domain, we selected it instead of graph database).

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Michael Dubakov</span> Cool stuff! I reviewed your videos and content. Great messaging too! Your videos are hilarious, great work, they feel really inclusive. I got the impression this was an alternative to perhaps Notion, Airtable, Asana, Jira or Basecamp. Focused mostly on CRM and knowledge. The disconnect for me was the no-code aspects, the concepts of “installing” templates felt strange (why not just “use” or “add”?) and the general positioning of the product feels at the crossroads of many tools that already exist in the market today. I empathize with the “all-in-one” approach however, the more and more you get all-in-one the more opinions start to form and the more rigid the product gets. I’m currently using Asana (IMO Jira is far to cumbersome) and Asana is really user freindly with a crazy amount of features,  I tried to keep an open mind yet at the same time I was thinking what really differentiates Fibrery to Asana? In my mind, this all circles back to it’s a project management tool. I would love to hear your reaction to this and see if you can help me fill in the gaps. Overall, I’m impressed and interested. I’m mostly curious as to what the largest customer/use case you have.
