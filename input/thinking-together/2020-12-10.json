        "text": "*Larry Tesler and NOMODES*\n\n&gt; During Larry's time in Xerox PARC there really wasn't such a thing as personal computers. At the time, software interfaces were designed around modes. In a text editor you couldn't just start typing and have words appear on the screen.. Larry pioneered the concept of software user studies, and found that many people would fail to get comfortable with the computer even after many weeks of use. And he believed that these modes were to blame, and they represented a threat to the dream of what personal computing could be.\n&gt; \n&gt; So Larry made it his personal mission to eliminate modes from software. And he formed a principle. No person should ever be trapped in a mode. His slogan that he'd go around saying is, \"don't mode me in.\" And his website is called: <http:\/\/nomodes.com|nomodes.com>.\n-- Bret Victor, 2012 (<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PUv66718DII>)\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot for a few weeks as I take my first hesitant steps into UI design and find myself immediately creating modal dialogs. What are people's opinions on the priority of modelessness relative to the other considerations we often discuss here? For example, my UI tries to follow a couple of other principles Bret Victor likes. It minimizes interaction and always shows the complete state at a glance (<http:\/\/worrydream.com\/MagicInk>), and it tries to reduce the need for the human to \"play computer\". Following Christopher Alexander, it tries to keep the display fairly stable and slow-changing. But. It has modal dialogs. 3 so far and counting. Once you bring one up, it's like a database transaction and you have to either commit or roll back.\n\nMy current thinking: it's ok if the time spent in a mode is short. A word seems short. It's not a huge hardship if you have to retype a word. Most of the time, words you type appear on screen. But I also notice that browsers used to bring up modal dialogs for say searching for a word on a page, and now they do so in a non-modal way where the panel pops up above or below the page while allowing you to interact with the page. I'm in text mode, so there's a fundamental limitation of only ever being able to interact where the cursor is. Perhaps that's the fundamental 'modefulness' here? I'm curious to hear what others think, and what stories people have about their experiences trying to avoid modes.",

What are people's opinions on the priority of modelessness relative to the other considerations we often discuss here? For example, my UI tries to follow a couple of other principles Bret Victor likes. It minimizes interaction and always shows the complete state at a glance ("
                            },
                            {

                                "text": "), and it tries to reduce the need for the human to \"play computer\". Following Christopher Alexander, it tries to keep the display fairly stable and slow-changing. But. It has modal dialogs. 3 so far and counting. Once you bring one up, it's like a database transaction and you have to either commit or roll back.\n\nMy current thinking: it's ok if the time spent in a mode is short. A word seems short. It's not a huge hardship if you have to retype a word. Most of the time, words you type appear on screen. But I also notice that browsers used to bring up modal dialogs for say searching for a word on a page, and now they do so in a non-modal way where the panel pops up above or below the page while allowing you to interact with the page. I'm in text mode, so there's a fundamental limitation of only ever being able to interact where the cursor is. Perhaps that's the fundamental 'modefulness' here? I'm curious to hear what others think, and what stories people have about their experiences trying to avoid modes."

        "text": "&gt; Was religion in a more enlightened form before print culture?\nIt’s complicated, but kind of, because religion is primarily about explaining the spiritual. Religion sometimes explains the material (though most frequently when the material is inexplicable), like the creation of the Earth, and stuff. It also occasionally focuses on the logical…\n\nBut religion is primarily there to explain that which is immaterial — the connection between this and that. The connection between your soul and your body, between a mother and a child, between our past self and our future self, between love and creation, etc.\n\nMost of what religion tries to discuss can’t be easily reasoned about, or represented symbolically. It is mostly _felt_ or _experienced._ Hence, *religion can’t be put into print.* Sure, stories can, traditions can, beliefs can. But _the stories, traditions, and beliefs aren’t the religion._ They’re merely pointers, trying to reference different aspects of the religion, which is not itself something that can be put into words.\n\nAs an increasing amount of our thought was offloaded from feelings to textual analysis, we started thinking like readers. And readers think in a different way from non-readers. Just like speakers think in a different way from non-speakers (see <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monastic_silence|monastic silence>)",
