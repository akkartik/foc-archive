Hi everyone! :grin: I am Josh. (PullJosh on the internet)<br/><br/>I am a college student now, planning to become a high school math &amp; computer science teacher.<br/><br/>As a kid, I spent almost all my time on Scratch, where I found a community of like-minded kids who loved to code.<br/><br/>Nowadays, I’m mostly doing web development. I love it, but I haven't found the same community as I had on Scratch.<br/><br/>To that end, I am trying to build a visual web coding tool that serves much the same purpose as Scratch did for me. It should be a gentle on-ramp to web development that encourages expressing yourself, building &amp; hacking together, and sharing your work.<br/><br/>Hopefully it can happen. :crossed_fingers:

Welcome Josh!<br/>I don't have any experience with Scratch, I'm curious to hear what are your favorite points of the Scratch community?

Meanwhile some of us have been using Scratch since it was called Squeak Etoys.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Daniel Garcia</span> Three things I liked about the Scratch community:<br/>1. It was very easy to share projects and get feedback, and that feedback was overwhelmingly positive. It's <b>very</b> motivating for your work to be seen.<br/>2. The <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/31/">Scratch forums</a> were brimming with extremely talented kids (and adults) who pushed the boundaries of what could be done with Scratch. People were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121020224254/https://scratch.mit.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?id=58790">modifying Scratch</a>, compiling <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/50212/">other languages into Scratch blocks</a>, creating <a href="https://tosh.blob.codes/">alternative Scratch project editors</a>, and much more. Being surrounded by so much raw talent as a kid showed me what was possible and made me want to prove myself, both of which were inspirational. (Nowadays, I often see old Scratch friends popping up in unexpected places. <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/">Alyssa Rosenweig</a> was one of us and is now a Hacker News super star.)<br/>3. Scratch provided a very friendly on-ramp to programming, both technically and in its community.<br/>    ◦ Technically: A palette of all your commands, no such thing as a syntax error, built-in image/sound editing, etc<br/>    ◦ Community: Strict kid-friendly moderation that was hell-bent on keeping the site positive, an extreme focus on "remixing" the work of others, etc.<br/>

Hello Josh!<br/>  Welcome! I think you might enjoy this talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U6MkU5fLJw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U6MkU5fLJw</a><br/><br/>you’ll find a clear influence of Kay’s as well as Papert’s (Mindstorms) lingering under the hood.

Hey, Josh. I spend my time building something that is basically scratch for law. :) Very interested to see your stuff.
