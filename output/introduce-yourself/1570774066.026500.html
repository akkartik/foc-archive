<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dan Cook</span> Yes, the eventual goal is for Glance to become a code editor/debugger for Haskell or other languages. Currently, Glance drawings don't scale well to large and/or complicated functions, so I have been thinking about how to improve that recently. I think adding a more structured and linearized node layout (in addition to the current layout) with lines/wires routed in a more organized fashion might work. Right now I'm attempting to prototype the new layout by taking textual Haskell code and adding ASCII art lines to it.
