Hi! My name is Rae and I just graduated from Columbia University with a CS degree. I think I landed here based on a podcast and came down a rabbit hole finding myself agreeing with this thought “why haven’t we thought about the future of programming more?” I’m currently doing a lot of software engineering interviews atm and a project on tagging patient stories and medical terms (think webMD but like chatbot style almost) - a NLP model is already well trained for this, I’m just building an interface on top of it.
