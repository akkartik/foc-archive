It took a couple of days but I've now completely rewritten <a href="1727029942.017819.html">my parser</a> so it can serve both for display and computation duties. Displaying requires keeping track of spaces. Computation requires detecting invalid statements.<br/><br/>Now <a href="1726630509.724069.html">the notebook</a> can perform computations in (indented) code lines.<br/><br/>Still missing: synchronization between code lines and prose lines. The screenshot for example shows me redundantly defining <tt>ice_kg = 2</tt> to provide it to code lines. Also, <tt>heat_flux</tt> is computed in code, but not yet filled in the blank space in prose.<br/><br/>I'm continuing to accumulate design principles:<br/>• (generalizing from <a href="1726811395.937989.html">before</a>) Everything is visible and easy to discover, whether it's the formula for a blank or the syntax to define a new blank or how to change colors. Any pattern you see on screen is easy to copy with the keyboard. (The one exception right now is the use of <tt>|</tt> characters in blanks and <tt>/</tt> in code. Both turn into horizontal lines.)<br/>• What you typed in is saved in the document -- except what you put into blanks in prose. Blanks are not saved, but can override default values defined in code.
