<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nick Smith</span> The AR/VR/MR space has a certain UI possibility excitement that I haven't felt since being a kid in the 80s.  (Online in the 90s and mobile were smaller blips.)  I take the variety of dubious, beautifully awful VR experiences as a great sign.  I'm sure we'll figure out how to "ruin" it, but the potential here?  It's exciting and surprising.

It’s definitely exciting. My own theory is that AR glasses will end up being the dominant thing (rather than VR) because they let you still do your work in a physical workspace and let you easily transition between (and cross-contaminate) the physical and the digital. VR seems like it will end up being better for “immersive” experiences rather than day-to-day work.

Yes, I don’t think we’ll distinguish between AR and VR much at a not so distant time in the future, and your AR glasses will allow you to basically move continuously between minimal augmentation and maximal immersion depending on what you want.

A better question is what will we be getting done with these glasses.  I'm reminded of the James Cameron quote from last year was it?  Got a good day of retweeting, "VR is a yawn ... what most people are calling VR right now is not VR ... several generations of technology away," somehow missing a few moments later, "I work in a VR environment all day everyday ... if I wasn't making the Avatar films I would be experimenting around in VR."  It's a really weird space right now.
