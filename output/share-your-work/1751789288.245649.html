Finished my live, navigable and interactive visualization of the Observable runtime graph. Works on both Observable and Lopecode.<br/><br/>• live: if you add/remove a cell the visualisation update.<br/>• navigable: if you click a cell you are taken to the cell source (on observable this opens a new tab and scrolls to the cell)<br/>• interactive: as you scroll though birds eye view the detailed visualization expands the dependancies of the focused cell. You can click to pin the current cell.<br/>The overall point of this notebook is to provoke the reader into understanding the programming model and ask questions like "what is a viewof" when they try to understand the dependancy graph. Its also useful for authors to find stray dependancies and plan refactors on complex notebook networks.<br/><a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/cell-map">https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/cell-map</a>
