We're opening a new channel: #reading-together<br/><br/>This channel will be host to in-depth discussions of FoC-relevant academic papers and other long, substantial, or deep materials that deserve thorough consideration and reflection. It'll also be a place to request these sorts of materials — if you're looking for papers on a specific topic, post a request in this channel and the audience there might be able to help you find some.<br/><br/>Here's how it fits in with our existing channels:<br/><br/>#thinking-together — Deep, substantial discussions emerging from your own thoughts on the future of programming.<br/>#reading-together — Deep, substantial discussions emerging from FoC-related books or academic papers, and requests for such.<br/>#share-your-work — Links to FoC-related materials that you created, with the discussion focused on positive critique and encouraging feedback.<br/>#linking-together — Links to FoC-related materials that you didn't create, shared for general/casual interest.<br/>#present-company — All other discussions/links that might be of interest to the community, even if not directly pertinent to the future of programming.<br/><br/>Why are the channels divided in this way? To help <em>the audience</em> find something interesting to read or discuss. Each channel has a different tenor—a different kind of signal/noise—and when they're mixed together they tend to drown each other out. This plurality of channels places a bit of additional burden on those who post — you need to make sure you're posting to a channel that is compatible with what you're posting. When in doubt, just give it your best guess — though you can always DM me to ask, too.<br/><br/>Finally, this seems like a great time to plug the <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/member-handbook">Member Handbook</a>.<br/><br/>As I always say... <em>keep it futuristic</em> :amiga-tick:
