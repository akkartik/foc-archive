        "text": "TLDR: to me this is a pretty simple cost-benefit tradeoff. The reduction in regressions\/confused users is rarely worth the cost (imo).\n\n(Others have covered some of the points I make here as I wrote this, so apologies if I’m repeating anything)\n\nFor context, I cut my teeth in the bad old days of on-premise enterprise software. Our software was mission-critical, and it was incredibly difficult to entice customers to upgrade to new versions. For any given customer, the upgrade process could take a year or longer to work itself out. We probably had at least a half-dozen officially supported versions, and a handful of customer-specific releases on top. The decision-making process for determining what changes went where was a nightmare, to say nothing of the actual implementation. Our release manager was super-human. I never want to go back to that world again :)\n\nVersion compatibility is a pretty well understood problem, but supporting multiple versions simultaneously carries some pretty significant engineering and operational overhead. Running multiple versions of application logic is pretty straightforward, but there’s added complexity in request routing.\n\nTechnically, it _shouldn’t_ require more compute capacity to support multiple versions of a service, since each user can presumably only use one version at a time, but in practice redundancy means you’re going to need more infrastructure to support multiple versions for the same user base. So that adds more cost.\n\nEach live version of the code adds operational complexity of monitoring and diagnosing issues. Two or three versions might be manageable. Ten? Impossible (imo). Each live version increases complexity linearly if not exponentially. Continuous deployment means you’re pushing dozens of versions each week. There’s no way a team could stand up separate instances of each of these and maintain their sanity. Although the canary process does resemble this motion, it’s only managing two versions at a time, and for a limited time frame.\n\nThe temptation then would be to only stand up new instances for “breaking” changes. But it can be devilishly difficult to decide what a breaking change even is. For example, consider an enumerated data type. Simply adding a value to an enum is technically a breaking change, because existing clients can’t be guaranteed to know what to do with it. And that’s just on the API interface side. At least there you can do static analysis to detect breaking changes, although the tooling needed to do this adds its own overhead. Many breaking changes manifest in behavior or semantics, which are impossible to detect statically, and can be very difficult to detect with testing or human reasoning. So, the decision of whether a given release warrants a separate instance becomes a risk management exercise, which can be costly in its own right.\n\nPlanning gets more painful too with each live version. Security or critical bug discovered? Get ready for a lot of painful overhead and difficult conversations deciding to which versions the fix should be backported. Depending on how much drift there is in the code from one version to the next, it’s often not even obvious _how_ to backport a fix.\n\nFinally, these challenges often come to a head at the data layer. What happens when a new feature or bugfix requires a data migration? Unless you’re willing to maintain separate databases as well, it’s often practically impossible to support multiple versions, and even when it is, it adds yet more developer overhead.\n\nThere are solutions to all of these problems, but in my experience (over 20 years, for what that’s worth), it has never been worth the effort. While not exactly easy, it’s generally much more practical to adopt a posture of runtime compatibility with all live clients, with a multi-phase rollout process in the rare case where a breaking change is unavoidable. If you have a good client upgrade pipeline (browser-based client or app-store) this is pretty manageable.\n\nNote: <@UC2A2ARPT> makes a great point re: Datomic\/versioned data. Everything I said is based on the typical “mutation-friendly” architecture. It is probably possible to architect a service to accommodate many live versions practically, but this would have to be a fundamental design goal from the beginning. I’m not convinced there’s away to completely avoid at least some of the costs, however, so imo there’d better be a pretty good business reason to adopt this goal.\n\nAs we move forward and more of the software-using public becomes accustomed to and expects their software to keep improving, I’m not convinced there will ever be more than a sliver of the user base that wants to stay on older versions. The question is: how much is supporting this minority of users worth to you?",
