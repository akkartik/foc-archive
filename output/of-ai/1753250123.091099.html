That's an interesting way of framing AI usage. I'm not sure I like "authentic." I think there is a sort of expertise or craftsmanship or fluency that grows over time, but I don't know that it's ever inauthentic. I also think authenticity doesn't really explore whether you are upgrading existing systems, designing new systems for current tasks, or making new kinds of work possible. I think AI has unrecognized potential in that last category.
