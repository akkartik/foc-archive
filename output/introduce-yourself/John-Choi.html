Hi all!<br/><br/>I'm John, a backend software engineer in Seoul, specializing in AI with a personal interest in visualization and media-related programming.<br/><br/>I discovered this community by chance. While organizing my podcast subscriptions. I noticed episodes from FoC featuring Bret Victor and Miller Puckette, and had to listen! In addition to the subject matter, the style of discussion—tendency toward metaphors, mapping out conceptual spaces by considering their logical extremes, attention to useful details for generalization/abstraction—really resonated with me. When I found there was an entire community dedicated to this spirit, I had to join and say hi.<br/><br/>Currently, I'm particularly interested in flowcharts and diagrams-as-code. I'm working on a toy project called <a href="https://isnbh0.github.io/mermazing">mermazing</a>, which aims to add interactivity to mermaid.js graphs. To start with, I've added a feature where hovering over a node in the graph highlights all upstream and downstream nodes. This proved immensely useful for me personally when navigating complex mermaid graphs.<br/>(Small tip: if you work in <a href="https://mermaid.live/">mermaid.live</a>, add <tt>z</tt> to the URL hostname (making it <tt>mermaidz.live</tt>) and you can see my project's version of your mermaid graph!)<br/><br/>I'm excited to be here and look forward to exchanging resources and insights with everyone. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>tl;dr<br/>• <b>Name &amp; Profession &amp; Location</b><br/>    ◦ John, backend software engineer, Seoul<br/>• <b>Discovery</b><br/>    ◦ Found community via FoC podcast episodes (Bret Victor, Miller Puckette)<br/>• <b>Current Interests</b><br/>    ◦ flowcharts, diagrams-as-code<br/>• <b>Projects</b><br/>    ◦ <a href="https://isnbh0.github.io/mermazing/">mermazing</a> — adding interactivity to mermaid.js graphs<br/>        ▪︎ highlights upstream and downstream nodes on hover
