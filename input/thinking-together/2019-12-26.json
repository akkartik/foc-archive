This must succeed or fail as a single transaction\".\n\nOnly when there is a mismatch between the user mental model and the programmer's mental model, does software do things you don't expect and perhaps cannot understand (talking about designed behavior, not bugs and technical limitations). Ever find yourself having to figure out what the heck the program is thinking, because it's obviously not what you are thinking?
