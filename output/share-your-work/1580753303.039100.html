I've written some posts about "Observable for Jupyter Users," wondering if people find them useful.<br/>• Differences between Jupyter and Observable <a href="https://observablehq.com/d/b00406054cfb4875">https://observablehq.com/d/b00406054cfb4875</a><br/>• Visualize a data frame with Observable <a href="https://observablehq.com/d/eceaa744227c4fea">https://observablehq.com/d/eceaa744227c4fea</a><br/>• Interactivity in Observable <a href="https://observablehq.com/d/c4e1459a8a99cdaf">https://observablehq.com/d/c4e1459a8a99cdaf</a><br/>• Bonus: JavaScript for Python Programmers: <a href="https://observablehq.com/d/5e82392bae5fb729">https://observablehq.com/d/5e82392bae5fb729</a><br/>I'd be particularly interested in whether you think I'm identifying the differences in workflow in a digestible way. The goal is that these are tutorials, not marketing documents, if there's a difference. I guess they're marketing documents for programmers, not CEOs.

No worries about the disclosure! There's a solid contingent of people here who are being paid to work on their projects, and are facing very interesting and challenging issues. This is a space where people are encouraged share those sorts of projects and issues. Sure, excessive self-promotion is bad, but you have to go pretty far before running into that line. Please, feel free to post much more about your work on Observable.

Hey Thomas. We chatted briefly about FoC and notebooks at the December Observable meetup.  I've been using the platform more since then and having a ton of fun!  Buncha random notes on the top "Differences" notebook:<br/><br/>1. It's definitely a tough challenge to balance the tutorial aspect with the marketing aspect, but I think you should be a little more market-y, at least at the beginning of the first notebook. If you're imagining this as an entry point to Observable for a whole class of users, you should include a little more sizzle, and a clearer value proposition.<br/>1. I think you ought to list all the major differences after the first paragraph. Like literally: "The 3 Big Differences are..."<br/>1. You don't make it explicit, but it feels like the differences map well to abstraction level:<br/>  1. Code in a cell: Everything is (more or less) client-side Javascript<br/>  1. Cells in a notebook: Reactive Topological Execution<br/>  1. Notebooks in an ecosystem: Forking, Sharing, Imports...Users, Likes, Collections, Teams don't get mentioned, but the allure of the community features is a big selling point to me.<br/>1. The important little differences are still important. If you're coming from Jupyter, you want to know the keyboard shotcut to execute code is not the same. But I think you might want to given the "new web superpowers" more promience than the need to put parens around object literals.<br/>1. For explaining the reactive nature of notebooks, I find the DAG visualizations in @observablehq/how-observable-runs to be really helpful.  More broadly, It'd be great to see some visualization in this introduction to a visualization platform.<br/>1. I trust a product more when it's up front about what it can't do well.  Other than the challenge of learning the new model, I'd be interested to hear what a Jupyter user might actually miss, or work for which Observable might be a worse option.<br/>1. On the flip side of that, if you believe have good answers, it might be useful to reference the paper from this thread <a href="../thinking-together/1580337617.251900.html">../thinking-together/1580337617.251900.html</a> and talk about the "The Problems with Notebooks" that aren't problems for Observable.<br/>1. This sentence at the end is actually a great succint sales pitch.  Maybe lead with it: "The combination of living on the web, reactive coding, and cell imports makes Observable a uniquely dynamic community of collaborative creative coders."

Thanks Alex! Real helpful to hear.<br/>• I'm not imagining this is the initial entry point to Observable, but I should think about that use case because it's possible.<br/>• I like this three levels breakdown a lot.<br/>• The next notebook in the series is about data and visualization, but if it keeps people reading to sprinkle some of this in here maybe I should do that.

I like it. Just had a quick play with it, is easy to use and understand.<br/><br/>Looks like a reporting tool. I say reporting tool, because I don't see how data input would work. How do you add things to the database? ...<br/><br/>Would be good to have a seamless way of adding user input to the database, and also pulling the data back into the UI widgets <a href="https://observablehq.com/@bartok32/diy-inputs">https://observablehq.com/@bartok32/diy-inputs</a> ... I find a big chunk of development time is taken up by shunting data back and forth between the UI and Database.

oh storing data, sorry - yes absolutely. The DB api could be used to INSERT data but if it's public facing you can't give it db access, and you're stuck doing something like the Lambda that Chris hooked up for <a href="https://observablehq.com/@chriszs/point-to-ukraine-on-a-map">https://observablehq.com/@chriszs/point-to-ukraine-on-a-map</a>

Thanks. I found it in handleClick. uses a POST to send the data back. ...<br/><br/>Thoughts for you ... Browsers come with a Database built in, so I think direct access to the database in a non-issue these days.  It is more a matter of how much browser data can be backed up on a central server and how to share data with others.

Yeah, sorry for criticizing it for not being something it wasn't intended to be...I've also read through the Wrangling/Viz notebook. My notes mostly focus on wrangling, although I get that's not really the most important part of the notebook.<br/><br/><li> Maybe worth emphasizing in the d3.csv() section that D3 has a lot of functionality outside of rendering visual elements. I think coming from data work in R or Python, people associate D3 with viz, so they expect its API to map to what viz libraries do in those languages. (I say "people", but mean "me".)<br/><li> A minor point: I'm not sure about Pandas, but a tidy dataframe in R is a technically a list of column variables, not a list of row observations like the typical data array in js, although in practice you don't really ever think about it.<br/><li> I really like the comparison between map/filter and list comprehensions. The 1-1 translations are always great (I know you have a whole other notebook full of them). Consider including the Altair code that produces the equivalent of the vega-lite scatterplot.<br/><li> Just an aside, as I've tried to do a little wrangling in js recently, this pattern has been useful: <tt>data.map(x =&gt; ({...x, newVar: expr}))</tt><br/><li> Dataforge (haven't used it) might be worth mentioning as the most Pandas-like option. <a href="http://js4ds.org/#s:dataforge">http://js4ds.org/#s:dataforge</a><br/><li> I think the tutorial would flow better if the first chart you plot uses transformed data, rather than just the csv. Taking grouped counts and sums is a good realistic wrangling task.<br/><li> Not sure it fits here, but I could see Math.sum(1,2,3) in js being confusing coming from python's sum([1,2,3]).<br/><li> The part about getting Observable charts back into Pythonland is great. Definitely mention at the beginning that's where the tutorial is going.<br/><li> And I saved my lamest gripe for last: iris is a boring dataset.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Thomas Ballinger</span> .. Do your customers want to do more than reports? So to make it easy to store and update  information as well as create reports, you could add something like  <a href="https://pouchdb.com/">https://pouchdb.com/</a><br/><br/>Then things like this would work:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">localStorage.setItem('name','Chris');</pre><br/>let myName = localStorage.getItem('name');<br/><br/>No need for POST statements. No need for custom server side code.  For the end user, this would be a simpler solution.<br/><br/>This also opens up the option of people working off line, and the data syncing after they are back online.

Got it, that's a neat thought! I might try it in a notebook. There's no good integrated persistent state solution yet, similar to Jupyter notebook users have to choose their own. This would be a cool one to use, but as you say it would be slicker if we provided the backend.

I had a quick look at the first two parts. The first one is a good overview of the differences between Jupyter and Observable. The second one is a nice example for data analysis/visualization.<br/>If the goal is to get Python/Jupyter users interested in Observable, I'd say the big missing part is helping people with finding their way around the JavaScript ecosystem. Your second notebook does that in a way, but only for a very narrow application range.<br/><br/>Example: this morning I did a quick data analysis in Python/Jupyter: 1. read two datasets from an HDF5 file 2. perform a Fourier transform. 3. plot the Fourier transform. If I wanted to do that in Observable, I'd spend a lot more time figuring out how to read HDF5 files and how to do Fourier transforms in JavaScript than getting used to Observable. From that point of view, your tutorials are nice but only a small first step on the learning curve.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span> helpful to hear. Based on what you've read so far, is there something you can imagine trying to do in Observable alongside Jupyter? For your example say, is there a portion of the HDF5 to FT plot that you'd consider doing with Observable?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Thomas Ballinger</span> I’d try all of if it were straightforward. I don’t like Jupyter that much, so I am always watching out for alternatives. But it looks like HDF5 is a show-stopper. Some people report success compiling it with emscripten, but it’s a pain to compile and even more of a pain to use.

(I'm wondering if I should emphasize more the path of doing analysis in Jupyter then visualization in Observable)

from the product perspective, I don't JavaScript is going to replicate the scientific programming ecosystem anytime soon, or for this generation if tools, ever. So the use case of Observable now would likely be something besides a full replacement of Jupyter, rather a way to make a Jupyter notebook more interactive or a way to present results better

The data comes from experiments and keeps changing. I definitely don’t want a complex multi-tool setup fir processing it. Updates must be quick and not error-prone.

an approach I'd like to flesh out a tutorial for is building a custom visualization in Observable and embedding it in Jupyter, so using Observable as a widget development environment but keeping the existing workflow in Jupyter
