Sure you can turn off fancy shadows in some games to help keep the frame rates up, but it is pure torture for game companies when hardware firms come out with some unique-to-them feature set that is only useful in rare conditions.  The fact that XBOX and PS are so close in hardware technologies makes their life so much easier.\n\nAnother example is the instruction sets of the various intel processors. There is such a random assortment of availability of instructions, most programs don't even bother using the fancy new instructions, because it is less code overall just to go with software implementations of those functions, because your going to need to test the software version anyway.

They have no great semiconductor physicist staff, so they will remain dependent on their foundry (TSMC), and of course ARM to continue to improve the core designs.  Given that their mobile devices outsell the desktop machines by somewhere between 50 and 100:1 in unit volume, using the same chips for desktop is a logical cost saving measure.
