Hello, everybody.<br/>My name is <a href="https://turkmenson.com/">Medet Ahmetson</a> and I am launching a new social network where people create a community to work on the project together. The long term vision of the social network is a program synthesis, when a computer can fulfil the user's intention. But counter intuitively as most people try to solve it by improving AI, innovating on end user programming, I decided its better to make a place on internet when a non-technical people and programmers collaborate together.<br/><br/>Innovating the way how we use computers, decentralization is one of the dreams that I had since my teenage years. I formed it from old and mostly classic books in Computer Science. I am from Turkmenistan, a landlocked country in the Central Asia. In technology wise Turkmenistan stays behind than most of the countries. As such in late 2000s the Internet was quite expensive. Therefore, I could learn programming, understand how computers work only through a tiny budget, that allowed me to have a 5/25 megabytes per week limit. This allowed me to download, books the smallest in the size, dense in the coverage. As such those books were from the 80s, 70s. Rarely was something that was from late 2000s.<br/><br/>Despite learning the new technology, not different than todays tech stack, I was trained and got the knowledge from the pre-Linux/pre-Windows, immersed in the golden era of the hackers, stories of OS wars, how programming languages evolved. And telnet jokes.<br/><br/>On my free time, all these years I tried to achieve the program synthesis through various spectrums, following OS tutorials to create my own. Or writing my own programming languages from scratch. And also going into different programming language techniques such as Logic, Symbolic programming.<br/><br/>Here, I would like to find a like minded people who would be with me in a team to work on the social network. Or I hope I can get a support here. And that you guys will build your innovative stuff on the social network too.
