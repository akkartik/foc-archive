i remember asking my math professor, who was the chairman of the dept., and an absolute genius, about what did eigenvectors mean, and he was unable to explain it physically, yet the 3BlueBrown guy on the youtube did a lecture on it and really pushed it towards understandability. Really it is a skill beyond most teachers to know the more arcane subjects so well, and be able to explain it.  Some things like imaginary exponents are really just conventions, and don't have a physical reality; you draw the symbols a certain way to mean an operation, but to have an intuitive grasp of e to the i power, that is sometimes just not available. Mathematicians are very good at accepting very arbitrary rules, as a kind of game.  There is an awful lot of mathematics to know now, and it would take a lifetime to learn it, even with the best explanations. Mathematics is unlike any other science; it is purely additive, not subject to revision. Calculus didn't invalidate 2+2, unlike physics for example which when i was a kid said that the proton and neutron were indivisible, now they say they are both made up of 3 quarks, but that begs the question what is a quark made of? Hah.
