I really enjoyed the first Milewski video! I too don't want to get bogged down in philosophy but it's fun so I'll put some comments to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Daniel Hines</span>'s point in a thread to this post

I also watched some other videos related yesterday (Wadler's Propositions as Types <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU</a> from <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andreas S.</span> and the Erik Meijer video from <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Garth Goldwater</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMP6gI5mLHc)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMP6gI5mLHc)</a> and they both were pushing the opposite idea: the fact that category theory has exposed these deep relationships between diverse fields <b>is itself evidence</b> of <b>discovery of facts about the universe</b>. So I think he was responding to that point of view, and trying to explain the mystery of "why do all these things connect?" with a different philosophical bent.<br/><br/>And I happen to have a very similar point of view to him. I too think all these things connect because they are all formalisms made by humans -- as opposed to thinking they have existed in a platonic ideal and we somehow plucked them out. (I know that was a bit of a strawman, so help me out with the alternative perspective: what does it mean to discover something?) I am definitely an amateur philosopher, so feel free to school me, but my thought is that all we can ever do is touch reality indirectly (we can never have true knowledge of the world because where would it come from?), so we can never discover anything, we can only invent hypothesis or maps about what is there, and over time improve our maps bit by bit, but never perfecting them.<br/><br/>Mathematics is a very strange system of "maps" because it keeps new creating maps to talk about existing maps. And category theory is a very high-level map that can fit a a lot of other maps on it.<br/><br/>I don't think it's a self-contradiction to say that category theory is the most powerful tool humans have invented to think about compositionality... and compositionality is the most powerful tools humans have to think about complex problems. Thus, why we study category theory. Maps are designed to correspond to the world (including other maps, which exist in the world) -- but they aren't the world. They were <b>invented</b> by humans doing their best to model the world.

hmm... I think I agree with the premise (we're all trapped inside some kind of language-ish thing and relate to it rather than the world directly) but I think that also means we can't even relate to language directly—we have language about language and are always one step distanced from it. so we invent a new concept ("red", or "morphisms") but certainly don't know all the possible uses of those concepts. so we kind of smash them together and find out new things about our inventions, which feels like discovery. but to your point the discovery is about the capabilities of our invented constructs rather than the universe directly

there's almost a macro-style quoting issue here: we discover facts about "the world" rather than the actual world, but doesn't the argument bottom out here? we never interact with the actual world, just our linguistic perception of it

I'm with you. The distinction I'd make is that "finding new things out about our inventions" is itself invention.

If we’re saying that our minds, language, and the world have a mysterious, strange-loopy correspondence/relationship with each other, I’m totally into it. But if we’re saying we can only have knowledge of our own minds, I must vehemently disagree. I can’t offer any proofs to the contrary - how do you prove to someone they are or are not trapped in the Matrix or Plato’s Cave? I happen to believe you can prove this, and that DesCartes did prove this, but I’m not an expert in that and won’t get into it here. What I can much more readily point out is the deleterious effects of this kind of radical idealism on human health and happiness, which, though not rigorous, may still be convincing. Consider what we mean when we say of a person “She’s lost touch with reality”, or, “He’s trapped inside his own head”. If all our knowledge is invention, if the only thing we discover is the convolutions of our own mind, the world grows both very small and very boring. A view of the most picturesque and expansive landscape is still just a view of the back of your eyeballs. Even the most stimulating conversations are only conversations with yourself.

And why is it <em>necessary</em> that the world be nothing like our perceptions of it? What if there really are maps and sets and categories? Is that so impossible a notion? Does any of current knowledge demand the contrary?

&gt;Does any of current knowledge demand the contrary?<br/><br/>Yes. If you're looking for another rabbit hole to climb into, I can recommend George Lakoff's <em>Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things</em>. <br/><br/>It just occurred to me, that a third of the book, part 2, is titled “Philosophical Implications” and might be relevant for this discussion (not so much for learning category theory ;-). <br/><br/>It’s hard to summarize in a few sentences, but Lakoff presents a lot of evidence, both empirical as well as logical proof that Objectivist metaphysics and cognition (super-oversimplified: the notion that there is an external, independent reality/truth we are merely experiencing and modeling with thought and language) are not sufficient to create a theory of meaning.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Lakoff also goes into great depth that the usual reaction of people presented with that conclusion is to swing the pendulum too far to the other side, only accepting total Relativism then (similarly oversimplified: no objective, universal truth; everybody makes up their own) and then goes on to present an alternative model, Experientialism, which is what the book is about and super interesting, if you wonder how we can find a middle ground that gives us consistency to be able to communicate using consistent concepts, and yet still takes into account the fact that we are limited by our perception in physical, biological, environmental, sociological, and cultural ways.<br/><br/>I doubt that Milewski was alluding to any of that though and I feel like we definitely got on quite a tangent here.

To be clear <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Daniel Hines</span>, I'm not saying that our maps don't model reality well. To the contrary, I think e=mc2 and Newton's map before it were great maps. But neither existed independently and we're discovered. The fact that Lebniz and Newton invented them at the same time can be explained by the fact that there were likely similar ideas in the air that set the stage for that invention. Just because all our experience takes place in the brain doesn't mean we cant have meaningful experiences. The brain is a wonderfully powerful virtual reality machine, combing all sorts of senses of the world into a cohesive experience that's pretty accurate for most things that are about our size, speed, and mass

Back from Xiamen, I'll exercise some restraint only to suggest humility (and fun speculation) is the bast way to approach metaphysics these days.  By way of analogy, consider how Aristotle's elements (earth, air, fire, water) of combinations of qualities experiential qualities (hot, cold, wet, dry) eventually gave way to a regular periodic table and subatomic particles.  Likewise, I feel that Cartesian meditation gives us some insight into the quality of being a thinking thing, but not so much what underlies it.
