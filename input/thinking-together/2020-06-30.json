Instead of a webcam in the lower left corner, he had the pointcloud data of his face from a Microsoft Kinect rendered B&amp;W with a slowly orbiting camera. When he needs to step away from the computer, he runs a generative video experiment of mutated VHS footage as an interstitial. His game looks like ghosts coming out of TV static. He plays music that would fit right in with (and is often made by) the people behind <http:\/\/musicforprogramming.net|musicforprogramming>. His streams are both a thing you can watch with full attention, and something to put on in the background while you work to feel like you're in the most Lynchian\/Gibsonian coworking space. He's put a lot of thought and effort into the look and feel of his streams, his game, etc.\n\nHe also codes slowly, and mostly does print debugging, and struggles with dumb bugs. I think that's just... programming, today.",
