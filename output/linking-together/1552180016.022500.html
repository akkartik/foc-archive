well, in today's world, the HR dept has instructed people never to tell people who are being fired why they were fired, for fear it could backfire in some lawsuit. I find it very lamentable, because it deprives the person being fired of getting very important feedback. I prefer although it is completely out of style, to tell the person to their face exactly why they are so disagreeable or their work habits so objectionable that they must be sacked. Being fired has catapulted many people into fantastic success, as it is such a shock to the system that you can suddenly reinvent yourself. As my father Hamilton used to say, you never know where your help is coming from Of the three guys who used to do the Top Gear show, one of them James May had been fired from a series of jobs. He is now one of the most famous, and beloved, TV personalities in the world. I suspect if you ask a co-worker over a glass of beer they might tell you the real reason. People who row too fast in the boat definitely can cause fear for the slower-rowing people, so maybe you just picked too mediocre a company, and need to find one of the places where people can really throw themselves into their job and do great things.
