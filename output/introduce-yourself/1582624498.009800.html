Hi all, Martin here :slightly_smiling_face:!<br/>During college I competed in algorithms, did internships in Google &amp; Palantir and did my Master's thesis (MCS) in the field of bioinformatics (on the algorithmic side). After that I did a startup and worked on different projects, latest worked as a lead engineer for London-based bioinformatics startup (developing a web app/platform).<br/>I am excited about open source, computer science, functional programming, emacs, startups.<br/>Right now I am working with my twin brother on a programming language of our own that is specialized for developing web apps (I will write more about the language in the #share-your-work channel).<br/>I found out about this community through google search, and I am really excited that I will be able to learn from (and hopefully also help) so many experienced people working on similar problems!
