Am conducting a survey about a syntax preference. Option A is to make line comments use the C convention double slash (//). Option B is to make line comments use the '#' character. It is less characters, but a harder character to type. What is the opinion of this group?

I prefer <tt>#</tt> lately just because more languages use it. Seems useful to share linguistic conventions up and down the stack. Hadn't really considered the difficulty of typing; probably still shouldn't consider it. Emphasize reading over writing, and all that.

I agree. Only a small percent of programming is actually spent typing; most of it is spent reading and navigating the code. But even if that weren't the case, for something so small as 1 or 2 characters, I think it's purely just a choice of style

It really doesn't matter, but <tt>//</tt> looks visually a lot more dynamic and feels better. <tt>#</tt> is a bulky and messy character. So purely aesthetic choice for me. :slightly_smiling_face:

One thing to note is that on a Finnish keyboard, both “/” and “#” are equally difficult to type. Probably true for other non-English keyboards as well.

On the german keyboard, <tt>#</tt> is actually easier to type than <tt>/</tt> IMO. Apart from that, I find multi-line comments <tt>/*</tt> and <tt>*/</tt> convenient. I don't know a lot of languages that use <tt>#</tt>, but how do they handle multi-line comments? Python's approach of using multi-line strings <tt>'''</tt> doesn't seem right...

I agree with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> that consistency is probably the most important aspect. When using a keyboard shortcut for toggling comments, entering comments becomes consistent among many languages (just tried it with Rust, Python and TS in vscode, works out of the box). Additionally, syntax highlighting makes it easy to recognize comments and differentiate them from other code. I'd argue that when using an editor that provides both, the actual PL's choice of comment syntax doesn't matter. You could probably show Python code using C-style comments to me and as long as the comment would still be highlighted as comments, I wouldn't even recognize the difference.

If the choice is strictly between <tt>//</tt> and <tt>#</tt>, then minor preference for <tt>#</tt>.<br/><br/>If you gotta block-comment larger sections using random/sucky/unfamiliar editor then <tt>//</tt> is annoying: repeat sequence <tt>shift-7-7 down left left</tt> means non-trivial number of keystrokes per finger.

There's no obvious winner as both comment types are very popular. +1 Ivan, it depends on other factors - for instance in my LES language I used <tt>//</tt> because (1) it's styled after the C family of languages and (2) for unusual reasons specific to LES, it was useful to treat <tt>#</tt> as an identifier character (similar to underscore).

Hmm, at least I do think it's a bad idea to rely on assumptions about the editing environment. I think that's a significant part of language design, actually - otherwise it's about designing the editor, not the language. Of course, the issue is not black&amp;white. But I mean, if I could make assumptions about the editor, I could do things like define something horrid like <tt>{type: def: Contsruction{/- -/}}</tt> (or god forbid, xml :stuck_out_tongue: ) as the enclosure for some thing, and just leave it for the editor to display it with nice iconography and whatnot.<br/><br/>That said, I'm not a language designer, and will readily admit others are likely to be more informed about this than me.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> depends on the numbers, of course. Lemme define:<br/><tt>random</tt> = user is using an editor in random context (like a web editor)<br/><tt>unfamiliar</tt> = user has chosen an editor but has not become an expert and is unaware of functionality<br/><tt>sucky</tt> = user has chosen editor which outright doesn't implement the functionality<br/><br/>Let's look at mass-indent-macro which has a de facto implementation of (&lt;shift&gt;-)&lt;tab&gt; and the feature penetration is high.<br/>Here there are very few sucky editors, users become familiar with the editors quickly, and as a result, expect even random editors to support the functionality. So a language designer in this case could very well rely on such a macro.<br/><br/>But auto-block-comment-macro (which I was somewhat obscurely referring to here) does not have a de-facto implementation (or at least I don't know of one. Maybe I learn more today? :D)<br/>So for this situation all three groups are considerably larger and language designers... 'can' be justified in taking even such minor details into account.<br/><br/>I'm not proposing this as even the most important of the minor details of course, just brought it up as something that came to mind...

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ilari Kajaste</span> It's not cut and dried. I think certain things should be in the 'jurisdiction' of the tools rather than the language. Block commenting several lines at once feels like such a thing (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/4ootmz/what_is_your_little_known_secret_vim_shortcut_or/d4ehmql">https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/4ootmz/what_is_your_li&hellip;</a>).<br/><br/>Situations like this contribute to my skepticism of structured editors. It's <em>really</em> nice that our tools are often oblivious of grammatical structure. It's just so much <em>simpler</em> to just comment out lines rather than statements.

eh, sorry, my mental context was elsewhere. I just used that as keyword for the "select shit and press key and have it all be auto-commented". But we already shared that context and were already talking about the same thing.<br/><br/>Anyway: core point was more on that what can be assumed to be 'de facto standard' and what can't is a slowly moving target. And I don't think a language designer can try to be somehow 'timeless' here. A language designed now with modern tools is allowed and can be expected to look different to a language of tools 20 years past... even if it is semantically the same language.<br/>And knowing and caring about what is de-facto-editor-functionality on one hand and what is state-of-the-art editor functionality on the other hand are things that can and should influence this.

I agree with the suspicion on structured editors at least on intuitive level. :smile:<br/>It's not just commenting, but copy-pasting, refactoring, drafting syntactically incorrect pseudocode-stuff and then only fixing it later, etc.<br/>Sometimes the code comes together only after going through something that objectively was a huge mess all the time, and I end up feeling that it was correct all throughout.<br/>But I don't know. Maybe even tightly structured editors would allow for the same thing, even enhance it, if one got used to them?

Ok, so I did understand you the first time. I think my reasoning is that anybody who wants the power-user ability to comment out a whole block is also going to be using a high-power editor that can provide a single shortcut for it. <tt>shift-3 down left</tt> seems pretty lame as well :stuck_out_tongue: (Among other issues, it requires you to think about empty lines.)<br/><br/>This is turning into a bit of a tangent, but I think language syntax for block comments is deservedly an obsolete idea:<br/><br/>a) Non-nesting block comments (the way C and Java implement them) is obviously bad. I can't block-select twice to comment out.<br/><br/>b) Even if you have nestable block comments, you now have to be careful to only select well-contained blocks.<br/><br/>All this is unnecessarily complex. Just select blocks and hit <tt>C-/</tt>, and it'll always do what you want. Use my recommendation above and have the shortcut insert an extra leader character, and you'll also be able to undo such block comments really easily, while leaving real comments untouched. It works really well, and as I said in my reddit comment above, I don't really understand why editors and IDEs don't support it out of the box.

(Answering original question). My preference is <tt>#</tt> between the two. Likely because I've been using Python a lot. I also feel a single character is better, doesn't look like an operator (<tt>/</tt> by itself is usually an operator in most languages). I assume most folks just use editor shortcuts to 'comment block' anyway (I surely do). In any case, there's already a lot of shift_ characters used when programming.

Interesting results. It appears that no matter what delimiter you pick for line comments it will be inconvenient or ugly for someone. -- is definitely prettier, and more consonant with prose typographical traditions. // is easy to type on a US keyboard. # is the python/julia convention. Personally i feel that anything a language does to encourage commenting is a positive thing. Code is for computers, comments are for the humans reading the code. I detest Knuth's literate programming concepts, and i am often dismayed by the almost total lack of comments from the younger programmers who have yet to taste the bitter fruit of debugging someone else's uncommented monster codebase. When you have been tortured your entire career by the laziness of others, you learn good practices.

Mr Khanlou is a junior programmer, and his assertion that comments are a negative to a code base is primarily motivated by the fact that in his syntax coloring scheme they are faded out so thus unimportant. The fact that it is common to fade out the comments in code editors is an alarming trend, and i personally feel that people who refuse to document the purpose of function parameters should be punished. When you run JS code through Uglify or some other compression program, the first thing it does is convert all the variable names to single letters, and strip the comments out. I think people who irresponsibly dispense incorrect information should have to wade into a codebase of several hundred thousand lines, and see how much fun that is when you are under deadline pressure to fix some problem as i used to do as a consultant back in the day. Knowing the data structures is even more important than the function parameters, but when i  look at GitHub, i observe a sea of unprofessional code that would be very tough to repair. Programs last decades, and only people who have not endured the pain of reconstructing intent of the programmer - which is one of the most valuable things a comment can disclose - will cling to a flabby assertion born of laziness.

(To stipulate a couple of obvious statements: <b>a.</b> yes, judging the value of comments by the color most editors color them is stupid, and <b>b.</b> many codebases exist with extremely verbose and <em>worse than useless</em> comments. Just like there is prose of all qualities in this world. It's a jungle out there. All this has been said before.)<br/><br/>Back in 2012 I observed (at least?) two styles of comments out there in the wild: <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/2012-11-24-18-10-36-soc">http://akkartik.name/post/2012-11-24-18-10-36-soc</a>. So --  as an attempt to gain the best of both worlds -- I started programming with two colors for comments, one bright and salient and the other subdued. Maybe counter-intuitively, I tend to make the large comments of verbose commenters subdued, and the occasional flash of comment in a run of uncommented code bright and salient: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/H1h7M.png">https://i.imgur.com/H1h7M.png</a><br/><br/>A few years later I added a third color for code commented out using text-editor support (my link earlier in this thread).<br/><br/>And when I started programming a lot of machine code, I added a <em>fourth</em> color for comments. (Because machine code is one place where this sort of much maligned comment is actually useful:<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap"><br/># increment *(ESI+8)<br/>ff 0/subop 1/mod 6/rm32 8/disp8<br/></pre><br/><br/>(I actually also add comments in the middle of this line; the original line is twice as long. All tastes for comments converge when it comes to programming in machine code.))<br/><br/>Anyway, so yes, I now program with 4 colors of comments (and mostly avoid syntax highlighting almost anything else):  <a href="https://mastodon.social/@akkartik/101163809901430347">https://mastodon.social/@akkartik/101163809901430347</a>

I don’t know whether Khanlou is a junior programmer or not, but that doesn’t invalidate the argument he makes.<br/><br/>Often comments tend to become stale and cause confusion. If it matters, I say this as someone who considers himself as a senior programmer with experience in large codebases and organisations such as Google and ISNU.<br/><br/>Whenever possible, I prefer the code to be better organised to require less comments (for example functions split to units that make sense and have good names). And instead of comments explaining the types, I prefer checked type signatures. Instead of ad-hoc doc-tests patched onto the language in the comments, I would prefer integrated support for tests/examples as part of the language.<br/><br/>This is not to say that comments never have value. They can still be valuable.

I'm also in the camp that the aim should definitely be to minimize comments by moving as much of the information as possible to function naming, variable naming, invariant validation statements, type declarations, breaking down larger functions into smaller ones, function signatures, interfaces etc.<br/><br/>In some ways I feel this aspect of comments-to-code is one central benefit of OO paradigm in general that is quite often overlooked when comparing against less 'boilerplatey' solutions. Well-designed boilerplate (ie. well-named classes, interface dependency declarations etc.) is not a cost but a benefit

(Staying out of the comments being good/bad discussion but sticking with Wadler's Law here) I've wished comment syntax would let me attach comments to specific elements in the source code. E.g. I want to attach a comment to a specific function, or class (~Python doctrings) a specific local or parameter. And these should be available in the parsed tree for tooling. For instance see Nim's documentation comments: <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/docgen.html">https://nim-lang.org/docs/docgen.html</a>

A related feature would be if there was a special syntax to encode identifiers or expressions within the comment. This would be compiler checked, so if identifiers are renamed or removed you get a warning/error. Comments describe code, they should be able to refer to code elements via hard links.
