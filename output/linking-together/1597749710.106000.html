I think I agree with this, personally. I am much happier working forwards from something I completely understand, than trying to make sense of something that already exists.<br/><br/>This is the same motivation that leads people to use Excel for everything, often from scratch every time.

Sometimes I think that this is the primary reason why software reuse hasn't succeeded as much as some people would have wanted to. Not because OOP is flawed or whatever, but because people... just wanna have fun :stuck_out_tongue:

Easier, but not necessarily optimal. The distinction seems related to the one between ease and simplicity. There's a sense in which learning a CAD program is simpler than building one yourself, but whether it's easier depends on your starting point. Path dependence just ruins everything. :D

Learning to model in 3D is hard, as in expect to spend 2-3hrs a day for 15 to 30 days to learn Blender or Maya or 3DSMax or Cinema4D or Houdini or ZBrush or AutoCAD and maybe someday someone will figure out a way to make it easier (VR?) but when you look into it there's a reason and purpose for every one of the 6000+ features of blender or maya or 3dsmax and 2 weeks of work might get you some cubes and spheres on the screen but you won't be modeling characters for Uncharted or sofas for Ikea or cars for BMW.<br/><br/>It's nice if they are having fun but the idea that they got frustrated spending 30 minutes in a modeling tool and then spent 2 weeks making their own suggests mostly that in a year or two they'll realize they really should have spent the time to learn a modeling package if their goal was to model something.<br/><br/>It mean it's kind of like saying "I spent 30 minutes trying to learn guitar but it was too hard so I wrote some code to make chiptunes". Yea okay but you still don't know how to play the guitar and no amount of diddling with chiptunes is going to get you closer to being able to play that guitar.<br/><br/>PS: there are programs that make 3D modeling easier but they almost always fall short once you get serious. Like notepad is easier than vi and iMovie is easier than Final Cut Pro and MSPaint is easier than Photoshop
