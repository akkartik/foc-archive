What's up everyone! So happy to have finally joined! I'm George, I am currently working on developing my coding/engineering skills full-time after being employed as a barista for the past year. I studied computer science for several years in Boston, but was deeply unsatisfied with both the general CS curriculum and my own academic performance, so I dropped out to pursue other things. I grew up in Tyngsborough, a tiny town outside Boston, and now live in southern Maine. I've always been a fan of this community and it had a huge influence on my decision to go back to school this coming summer, where I will be studying sociology. I don't think I know anyone from here personally, but Maya Avenda√±o and of course Maggie Appleton have inspired me for quite a while now.<br/><br/>My first project is a lofi web radio for Byzantine music of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which will be released soon. I'm very excited to meet and learn with others in this community!
