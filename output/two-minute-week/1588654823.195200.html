Here is a follow up on the Beads layout system. Beads has a very unique layout system that is slightly more advanced than the Apple struts and springs system used in XCode.  You design your layout by starting with the full screen rectangle, and subdividing it into pieces. Each chunk can be further subdivided. It has pre-programmed the commonly used types of decompositions: plain, vertical slice, horizontal slice, vertical scrolling, 2D grid, and a farily elaborate report writer for those who need to produce printed reports in the classic style. Since the layout system is in the language itself, you can use variables, IF statements, and subroutines in the layout portion, unlike CSS which hampers you great. Another huge advantage over CSS is that Beads uses explicit whitespace so placement of items is 100% predictable and repeatable, unlike CSS which on a small typo can scramble your page.  Building a complex product by gradual refinement is the methodology you use in Beads; always proceeding from a working standpoint, and adding in detail.   <a href="https://youtu.be/lhLJbC7LA2k">https://youtu.be/lhLJbC7LA2k</a>

When you were sketching the design, does that actually generate code for you?

So far you can generate declarations, define data structures, in the UI of the IDE. Don't have layout via GUI yet, working on it now.  I am building the IDE in Beads, and it is open source and part of the SDK examples. The public has overwhelmingly expressed their desire, no expectation, for a graphical tool that generates code, so it shall be built!
