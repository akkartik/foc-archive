In many aspects visual programming, hygienic macros, adts from functional programming are already hitting mainstream popularity with things like Unity and Rust becoming so popular. I view blockchain, quantum and AI as storage / db improvements rather than programming improvements fundamentally and they have their place.<br/><br/>I think the next interesting wave of programming is going to be around improving the tools around programming like voice based programming, programming with the help of mobile phones and VR based programming IDEs. Thoughts ?

I have no idea what the results will look like, but I keep pondering a question that Brett Victor asked in one of his talks. I won't put it in quotes because I don't remember it perfectly, but it was something like: what would it mean to directly manipulate behavior?<br/><br/>I think a related question would be: how can we represent behavior so that it can be visualized and manipulated?
