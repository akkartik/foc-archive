        "text": "The most practical approach that I can see today, towards realising a truly 3D app, is mixing HTML with Three.js. One would write an app as they would normally which results in HTML elements, and then slap these elements onto 3D boxes that have volume. Then they would apply some kind of PBR shader to the box such that it has a realistic appearance. These boxes would shadow each other, and it could definitely have translucency too, so elements that need to represent glass would have realistic refraction and reflections. This opens up a whole new world for UX.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n1. Refraction - <https:\/\/codesandbox.io\/s\/2n98yj>\n2. Slapping HTML on 3D WebGL objects - <https:\/\/codesandbox.io\/s\/7ucso>\n3. Objects shadowing text - <https:\/\/codesandbox.io\/s\/p9umgf>\nTaken from here: <https:\/\/docs.pmnd.rs\/react-three-fiber\/getting-started\/examples>",

One would write an app as they would normally which results in HTML elements, and then slap these elements onto 3D boxes that have volume. Then they would apply some kind of PBR shader to the box such that it has a realistic appearance. These boxes would shadow each other, and it could definitely have translucency too, so elements that need to represent glass would have realistic refraction and reflections. This opens up a whole new world for UX.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n"
