Excel has a full programming language embedded inside. Because excel hides formulas and code, and shows data (the opposite of most programming environments) it is not surprising that many people think it isn't a programming language. But having been a business automation consultant and walked into companies who had a crazy quilt of automation, it was almost guaranteed that some critical business process was automated inside Excel. It is a very robust tool, extremely well tested, and i have only caught Excel in an error once. The latest versions of Excel can go to about a million rows before it chokes and dies. That is a lot of records! I call it the poor man's database system.
