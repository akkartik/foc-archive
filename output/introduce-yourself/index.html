Hello everyone,<br/><br/>My name is Hemi Edwards. I'm a computing and technology enthusiast from Aotearoa/New Zealand. I am indigenous and belong to the Rongowhakaata tribe of the Maori. We occupy our ancestral lands on the East Coast of Aotearoa/New Zealand, though we have lost much in the process of colonization. We have too gained much from our engagement with the rest of the world. For most of us our primary language is English but there have been efforts to revitalize our indigenous language of Te Reo Maori, for the last 50 years. Many other indigenous peoples see our success as an inspiration for the rejuvenation of their own traditional languages and I believe that digital technologies offer much to support this mission. Speaking English grants us opportunities to meaningfully engage with the wider work, especially in forums like this where we can learn about new possibilities and ways to think and interact with the physical world.<br/><br/>I have been familiar with Bret Victor's work for some years now and have been excited about the potential for these new approaches to make computer interactions more meaningful, embodied, and accessible than currently. This is really important especially when it comes to economically deprived and socially marginalized communities like my people, who lost much from colonization and whose experience in the traditional school system was specifically intended to stunt our development as individuals and as a people. This has had ongoing generational impacts for my people. Language revitalization is just one aspect of current efforts to close the gaps in terms of learning achievement, equitable economic participation, and development of personal and social capacity.

Hi! I’ve been hanging around here for a while and listening to the FoC Podcast, so I thought it’s time to finally introduce myself :slightly_smiling_face: I’m Daniel. I have a background in computer science and psychology, and over the years I’ve worked across Free & Open Source software (most notably with the GNOME project). I’ve been in the startup world, spent a few years in emerging tech consulting at Accenture, and these days I’m an independent consultant, speaker, and writer.<br/><br/>My work and philosophy are deeply rooted in the insights of visionaries like Doug Engelbart, Alan Kay, Neil Postman, James Burke, Joseph Weizenbaum, and Bret Victor. Their pioneering spirit, especially the idea that technology should not replace humans, but amplify human capabilities, is what guides my work.<br/><br/>Most recently, I founded the Big Idea Initiative - a playground for ideas that amplify our human capabilities and raise our collective intelligence.<br/><br/>We’re always looking for ideas, contributions, and people who want to explore new ways of thinking, building, and connecting. If you’ve got a half-baked thought, an experiment, or just curiosity - you’re very welcome to share and shape it with us.<br/><br/>You can find more here: <a href="https://www.bigideainitiative.org/">https://www.bigideainitiative.org/</a>

Hi all, I'm Nodar. I've been generally aware of the future of code (now feeling of computing) for a couple of years now but only just now got around to joining the Slack. My first coding experience was in HyperCard in the late 90s. Now days for development and personal work I'm terminal/keyboard focused over GUIs (or at least point &amp; click, mouse-oriented input), but still develop GUIs for end users, and for myself I still carry a deep interest in better interfaces, and their ability to reduce the friction and bandwidth between thought and computation.<br/><br/>Particularly interested in the evolution of ideas around literate programming, and also ways of extending the computational notebook paradigm.

Hey everyone, I'm Craig (or <a href="https://graic.net/">Graic</a>), and I'm a Computer Science student at NCSU.<br/>I found the podcast (and then the slack) by googling "Bret Victor". I've been following the Bret Victor, Strange Loop, Ink and Switch adjacent space for a while, It's great to see a community interested in these sorts of ideas!

Hello, everyone; I'm Joel. I have been involved in computing since my student days in the late 60s, so I've been around since before "structured programming". :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>I somehow found out about the weekly newsletter, and that eventually led me here.

Hello World! I'm <a href="https://arcades.agency/portfolio.html">Arcade Wise</a>, 18 and from... I guess the southeastern United States? I've lived all over and college is in Iowa.<br/>Given the mention of college I bet you can figure out that I'm a student, studying Computer Science and German.<br/>I haven't had enough time recently to do much coding, but I think y'all might like my project "<a href="https://arcades.agency/icbinf.html">I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT FORTH</a>," a little project to write HTML widgets in a forth-like language.<br/><br/>I've been mainly involved with the folk.computer people, I really think projected AR is a really interesting thing that not enough people have access to. I'm also tangential to the <a href="https://computingwithinlimits.org/2025/">LIMITS</a> (Computing Within Limits) conference, and the larger degrowth-club of Rome movement as a whole.<br/><br/>As for how I got into the FoC community, I was introduced to Ivan and Co. by Lu, whose videos I had watched for a while and met at Strange Loop (RIP).

<br/>
HELLO! I am Laura Brekelmans, 29 years old and from the Netherlands.<br/>I'm a professional software engineer, and <a href="https://laura.fm/generative-art.php">I sometimes dabble in creative coding</a>.<br/><br/>I also published some articles<br/><br/>• <a href="https://laura.fm/generative-art/heart-deconstruction/techniques.html">This one</a> where I deconstruct a generative art piece by Terebus Volodymyr is still my favorite published work of all time. (note, doesn't work on mobile! Whoops)<br/>• A few years ago I also published <a href="https://github.com/Azeirah/A-new-wave-of-programming">an article on the future of coding</a> myself which was somewhat popular at the time.<br/>My interest in the future of coding emerged when I discovered Bret Victor's work about a decade ago at this point (woah). Ever since that I dove deep into history of computer science, have consumed hundreds of hours of Alan Kay, Ted Nelson, Bret Victor, Douglas Engelbart, HARC, Viewpoints research institute, Dan Ingalls, Bill Buxton etcetcetc.<br/>I'm also somewhat active on the <a href="https://github.com/ohmjs/ohm">Ohm Discord</a>, I think that community might have some overlap with this one! Ohm is a library as well as an ecosystem of tools to make grammars and programming languages.<br/><br/>I often have ideas for meaningful or interesting new ways of doing programming or interacting with programming tools, but I never really felt like I had the room for these ideas to grow larger so not much has come of it (so far!)<br/>When I was still a student I was really active making codepens, generative art, programming language experiments, blog posts and <a href="https://laura.fm/generative-art/wind/wind.html">even entire programs</a> <em>as part of a conversation to other programs</em> just because I thought it was cool. A bit later I got into a really deep depression and I've kind of lost my mojo, but I'm sort of trying to find it back again? I've since recovered, gladly, but I'm still feeling the discrepancy between how creative and active I was back then. I hope by joining this community I can reignite some of that passion again :c<br/><br/>I <em>think</em> I learned about this community through Lu Wilson, who has also been really inspiring for me the past year. Thank you for doing your thing Lu!<br/><br/>Edit: Oh and I forgot, I'm working on <a href="https://github.com/Azeirah/ma">a realtalk implementation in JS</a> called <em>ma</em> which is available on Github. It's very very early in development, I just work on it every now and then. It's mostly meant for fun, but it works.

Hi there! I'm Damian,<br/><br/>I'm a professional software developer and a non-professional creative technologist with a background in designing a lot of silly projects for exhibitions, i've got a massive lack of focus, tending to be caught by different whims for creative design based on different projects, finding the right tech to suit certain aspects. I've been quite insular with a lot of my development, especially for festivals, so this year i've been trying to be a bit more open and show off some of my work.<br/><br/>I've realised that there's limits to how much you can learn while being secretive and insular, so really wanted to join a community and connect with others interested in these types of computing! I'm very used to a professional software world where there's a lot less room to play, so it's felt really nice to try and revive some of the passion that brought me into programming in the first place this year.<br/><br/>A couple of my projects:<br/><br/>• <a href="https://nimby.bemben.co.uk/">NimbyDex </a>- a highly insulting gemini agent with GL mapping frontend that attempts to quantify the "NIMBY"ness of cancelled renewable projects in the UK <br/>• <a href="https://sheffield.ac.uk/ideasbazaar/projects/inside-box">Think Inside The Box</a> - an old festival project that used a mixture of AR and VR to create small teaching moments for different engineering disciplines <br/>• 3D prints with LIDAR data to create little mementos + matchbox buildings for smaller venues with loads of charm. This involved getting really in-depth with blender, mapping + python scripting within blender. <br/>I'm definitely very scattered in the stuff that I make, and i've begun this year to finally start doing lots of talks, got recommended this by Hugh Evans who organises AI Signals! I'm also organising a community within Southampton based around creative coding, so wanted to get more properly involved! This seems like a great community!

Hi everyone, I’m David :wave:<br/><br/>I’m a Swiss interaction developer with a strong focus on creative tooling, color, and generative systems. My background spans (frontend) programming, UI/UX, and generative art — especially where these intersect with visual design. These days, I spend a lot of time thinking about how interfaces can better reflect the messy, nonlinear way humans think and work.<br/><br/>Some of my recent-ish work:<br/><br/>- <a href="https://meodai.github.io/poline/">Poline</a> — a library for generative color ramp creation<br/>- <a href="https://meodai.github.io/rampensau/">RampenSau</a> — an other tool for exploring color ramps<br/>- <a href="https://verloop.xyz/">Gradient Book with Rik Oostenbroek</a> — a collaboration for Paris Photo 2024, exploring code-based gradient manipulation<br/><br/>I found FoC through <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Florian Schulz</span> and joined to connect with others exploring alternative paths in computing — especially where creativity, expressiveness, and play intersect with code.<br/><br/>Currently, I’m working on a descriptive design language for color — a way to create semantic and functional links between colors. Kind of a missing bridge between generative color systems and real-world design use.<br/><br/>Looking forward to learning from you all!

Hi there! I was subscribed to a newsletter digest for a while so it's time to participate. I work on a new extremely composable visual programming language embedded in a font (so that you can use it in Visual Studio Code, for example) implemented as a Haskell eDSL. Here you may find more info: <a href="https://muratkasimov.art/Ya">https://muratkasimov.art/Ya</a>. I think that future of programming is in hands of linear algebra and category theory.

Hi there, I'm Dave and I've been exploring a lot of the basics behind the connections between learning and programming for the last 25 years, jumping in and out periodically along the way. Having a lot of fun re-discovering all the things I learned previously and making new connections and seeing what's been happening in the meantime.

Hey folks, great to be here - it’s a joy to find such a forward thinking, open-minded community. Looking forward to taking a bit more of an active part.<br/><br/>I’ve been working with Clojure, and especially Datomic where I can, for the last few years, with small forays into iOS and (slightly larger excursions) web applications. FP, structural editing and s-expressions are my happy place, mashed up with abusing browsers and CSS to do occasionally surprising things. I amuse myself with generative art pieces when I have time, using quil and trying to keep up with some of <a href="https://www.tylerxhobbs.com/">Tyler Hobbs</a>’ excellent examples. <a href="https://www.owenschuh.com/">Owen Schuh</a> is another favourite - really love his work. Suggestions for more brain food are always welcome!

Hi, my name's Ryan. I've worked in and around the more corporate low-code/no code space, which isn't always great but I've spent a long time thinking about end user programming. I've also built some tools for LED art, though they've bitrotted slightly by now.<br/><br/>AI coding agents have me simultaneously extremely pessimistic about code as craft and optimistic about expanding what's possible with computers, and I want to figure out how to be on the right side of that line.  I'm between jobs and reading a bunch of papers which led me here, and this feels like the sort of place that skews towards optimism.

Hi! my name is Hernán Wilkinson, from Argentina, Smalltalker :slightly_smiling_face: , professor at the FCEyN-UBA, partner at 10Pines and FAST (Argentinean Foundation of Smalltalk).<br/>I’ve implemented LiveTyping for Cuis Smalltalk. LiveTyping collects types while the system is running (in Smalltalk that is all the time, even when programming) and retro-feed that info into de development environment to improve tools such as refactorings, autocomplete, etc. LiveTyping allows you to use development tools as if you were using a statically typed language but in a dynamically typed one, without the burden to define and maintain the types.<br/>I’ve also implemented many refactorings for Cuis Smalltalk and created a distribution called CuisUniversity to teach OO at the university, besides other things.

Hi,  I'm Rafia !<br/><br/>Someone who's always curious and eager to connect with people who enjoy exploring bold ideas. I'm on a mission to rethink how software is built — not just line by line, but as if we could <em>download</em> complex systems at scale, like aviation-grade software.<br/>If you're someone who loves debating the unimaginable and pushing boundaries in tech, let's connect and explore what's possible.

Hi there! :wave: I’m Jared. I’ve been ~lurking~ listening/reading for a while. I found the community via a recommendation from <a href="https://taylor.town/">Taylor Troesh</a> when lamenting the end of the Strange Loop conference. I host the <a href="https://elm.town">Elm Town podcast</a> where I interview folks through their software engineering journeys to understand why they are in the Elm community and how they got there. Sometimes I talk with folks outside of the Elm community when it relates to Elm.<br/><br/>I’m interested in unique perspectives and ideas in humanity, computing and beyond. I’m also interested in the way technology integrates into nature. If this community advances human-computer interaction, I am interested in technology-nature interaction. That is, how to make our technology more in-harmony with nature (sustainable, balanced, and connected). It’s not a binary distinction nor two-dimensional. We come from nature and by extension, so does technology. But we think of ourselves as outside of nature. I’m interested in challenging that assumption in order to enjoy our creations without burning down the house.

Hi all!<br/>I'm Alex, long-time (mostly web) programmer who tried for a while to explore the intersections of arts and tech, especially to gain back control over the tools and keep active a form of critical doing (re: critical thinking) around what we take for granted. Not too serious. I'm especially fond of design fiction, creative coding and livecoding.

Hello everyone, I’m <a href="https://yihungchou.com/en/">Yi-Hung Chou</a>, a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at UC Irvine. I’m deeply interested in how developers understand and navigate the dynamic aspects of software—whether it’s debugging, running tests, deciding where to write tests, or ad-hocly writing <tt>console.log</tt>!<br/><br/>Recently, I analyzed a dataset of accidentally pushed <tt>console.log</tt> statements on GitHub (e.g., <tt>console.log("here")</tt>, <tt>console.log("is this code running")</tt>) [<a href="https://2025.msrconf.org/details/msr-2025-technical-papers/7/Learning-from-Mistakes-Understanding-Ad-hoc-Logs-through-Analyzing-Accidental-Commit">paper here</a>] . We hope this dataset and our methods can provide valuable insights for language designers, programming tool developers, and library maintainers—like you—on the challenges developers face in understanding run-time behavior. If you’re attending MSR or ICSE this year in Ottawa, come say hi and check out my talk!<br/><br/>I’m also working on a tool to help developers better organize and make sense of interleaving log outputs from asynchronous and parallel programs. I will definitely  share more about it soon in the share-your-work channel.<br/><br/>Shoutout to all the amazing work shared here—I’m excited to read your ideas and get inspired!

hey everyone! I’m killick, I’ve been a programmer for 15+ years. I work in non-profit orthopedic healthcare. Right now I’m uuubsessed with legacy systems migration (aka been in it for so long I have to justify its value). <br/><br/>questions that haunt me rn:<br/>• why do ppl assume rebuilding from scratch is easier?<br/>• is small incremental migration always more desirable?<br/>• are there any general criteria for picking a migration strategy? (cf Patterns of Legacy Displacement)<br/>• is there a negative correlation between familiarity with a system and the perceived difficulty of migrating it? or vice versa?<br/>anyhow, this is my latest rabbit hole. previous (and evergreen) ones include uiua, coordinate systems, a multi-user simultaneous room-scale development environment, and the indie web. <br/><br/>happy to be here!

Hi, I'm a professional software engineer with about 20 years of experience, in finance, ad tech, and ed tech. So not much along the lines of future or coding kind of orientation. I'm also a hobbyist audio programmer of limited ability but great enthusiasm. I'm obsessed with the Terry Riley composition "In C," and have written / re-written frameworks to perform it in ruby, Python, Chuck, and now headed in that direction again, this time in rust. This is the <a href="https://github.com/photographs-msw/rosco">rust project</a>.

Hi there!<br/><br/>I'm Sidney Congard, I worked 3 years as a C++ programmer then went back to studies: I'm now a phd student in programming languages (in France), flavored with linear logic. I'm interested in the treatment of mutability in programming (e.g. borrows), and more generally by the merry mess that is coding.<br/><br/>I came to lurk and perhaps exchange on similar topics :)

Hello everyone! I'm James (<a href="https://jamesg.blog">https://jamesg.blog</a>) :sparkles: I have been lurking for a little while and wanted to say hello!<br/><br/>I am thinking more about tools that encourage me to create with my phone. Last year, I made a <a href="https://github.com/capjamesg/knowledge-graph-language">query language for knowledge graphs</a> that I plan to continue working on soon. I am also thinking about a minimal interface for authoring HTML documents on mobile devices (how concise can the syntax be?).<br/><br/>I also maintain a website that lists <a href="https://airportpianos.org">what airports have pianos</a>.<br/><br/>It's great to be here!

What's up everyone! So happy to have finally joined! I'm George, I am currently working on developing my coding/engineering skills full-time after being employed as a barista for the past year. I studied computer science for several years in Boston, but was deeply unsatisfied with both the general CS curriculum and my own academic performance, so I dropped out to pursue other things. I grew up in Tyngsborough, a tiny town outside Boston, and now live in southern Maine. I've always been a fan of this community and it had a huge influence on my decision to go back to school this coming summer, where I will be studying sociology. I don't think I know anyone from here personally, but Maya Avendaño and of course Maggie Appleton have inspired me for quite a while now.<br/><br/>My first project is a lofi web radio for Byzantine music of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which will be released soon. I'm very excited to meet and learn with others in this community!

Hi new friends, I'm Zeke. I live in Chicago and I love thinking about the future of computing in my spare time. In my day job, I'm a staff engineer at Abridge.<br/><br/>I'm happy to find this space because I've been doing a lot of reflection alone or among friends and it seems like you are doing it together, here.<br/><br/>I've recently been reworking <a href="https://offbyone.us/posts/cost-of-computing/">a blog post about the cost of computing over time</a>. It's still a work in progress, and maybe it will be forever, and I'd love to hear what you all think about it.<br/><br/>I'm also doing some personal research projects (like a typescript / prompt IDE in tldraw!). I'd be stoked to talk to folks about that too. But, as a parent of young children, my time is limited so my work moves slowly!

Hi everyone! I just joined the community, so it's nice to meet you all. My name is Isaac Carrasco-Ortiz (he/him), and I am the Digital Equity Fellow for the Executive Office of Aging &amp; Independence based in Boston, Massachusetts in the United States. I have been here as an AmeriCorps member, where my role is to help the state agency address digital inequities that exist for older adults throughout the state (poor access to broadband services, poor digital skills, access to respectful technological devices and services that best fit their needs). We've mainly been fighting for this through federal funds that were made available to address the digital divide (funds were given to senior centers and their partners to start or expand digital literacy programming for older adults). However, now that the funds are set to run out, we've been sketching out what role the state agency can play in making technology more respectful and socially conscious of the needs and thoughts of older adults in Massachusetts moving forward. I've been increasingly exploring this relationship between humanity and technology, and it's through some more reading of that that I learned of Douglas Engelbart's Augmenting Human Intellect essay. I thought I'd look more into if other organizations were speaking about this essay, and it's through that search that learned of the Future of Coding, namely the podcast episode that spoke about him and his work (I haven't listened to it yet!).<br/><br/>I hope to become active in this community. If you're in the Boston area and are interested in learning more about what we're up to, just shoot me a message! I should note that my background is not in tech, but rather sociology and systems of oppression. Looking forward to learning more about your work and insights! Thanks y'all :blush:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-carrasco-ortiz-42639b1aa/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-carrasco-ortiz-42639b1aa/</a>

Hi! I'm Padraig, I'm based in London and mostly work on the frontend (although I'm increasingly keen to get deeper than that...) I don't fully understand what this place is yet but I like the vibes. My interests tend to swing heavily retro gimmick stuff (e.g. I could probably write a blog about children's watches in old Argos catalogs and how they perfectly represent the technologies of the period) so it's debatable how much I can contribute to the future...<br/><br/>My attempts to make positive contributions towards the software dev ecosystem are generally a mix of (in order of importance):<br/>1. making sure websites I work on still work on my mam's phone<br/>2. pushing back in my workplaces against Google Analytics being dumped into absolutely everything everywhere<br/>3. posting literally anything possibly useful I discover about a thing in a public location so others can find it in the future (tbh I think this is arguably the most important one these days...)<br/>4. reviving old abandoned tech either via software (e.g. most recently I reverse engineered an ewaste STEM toy and made a library for it <a href="https://github.com/padraigfl/twsu-arcade-coder-esp32">https://github.com/padraigfl/twsu-arcade-coder-esp32</a> , previously I wrote some tools and documentation to help preservation efforts for the abandonware mixed media card game Dropmix) or just finding personal uses for them (e.g. the FM radio station of rain sounds I've in my flat so our dog can't hear the foxes our neighbour keeps feeding)<br/>5. dumb half-finished proof of concept stuff like my recreation of the Shrek DVD menu (<a href="https://github.com/padraigfl/dvd-menu">https://github.com/padraigfl/dvd-menu</a>)<br/>Most my social network are extremely non-technical people so it'd be great to get involved in some things with people who know what I'm talking about when I talk about these things (or can tell when I don't know what I'm talking about and call me out!). Should be at the meetup this Friday, not totally sure what to expect but I'm looking forward to it!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.pdrgf.com/about">www.pdrgf.com/about</a>

Hi all! I'm When. I'm excited to participate in discussion here and share ideas. I've been a long time dreamer in what has been possible for the future of code. I've been working in software for over 20 years now and I've always been passionate about empowering people with software, especially those who don't know how to code. I have a degree in both Art and Computer Science, and the intersection between expression, intention, interface, abstraction, and usability has always been of keen interest to me. I mostly found my calling in writing tools that allow other to work at a higher level.<br/><br/>In 2007, I wrote what I believe to be the first ever "reactive javascript framework", at least in the form you see now - client-side templates, data-binding, client-side routing, components etc. I had to do a lot from scratch: module system, template compiler, fine-grained data-binding system. I've been watching the rest of the industry do it wrong ever since (I'm kidding! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:). It's still in use by the company I built it for (although I don't work there anymore), and it beat out Vue 3 + Vite in a head to head evaluation recently (from what I hear). It currently powers a loan automation system that handles billions of dollars in loans. I was never able to open source it, so I guess y'all have to take my word for it, lol. Happy to talk about it if there's anyone curious. It still has a few tricks I haven't seen in the wild. I've also built a custom workflow engine and business rules system that had a pretty unique architecture and scaled really well (over 500k rules), and actually delivered on the promise of moving a huge amount of logic into the hands of non-programmers (without needing programmers to babysit it). Those are some things I'm most proud of and have deeply informed some of the ideas that I imagine for the "future of coding".<br/><br/>My closest thing to an actual claim to fame was my involvement in the standardization of ES6. I have a name credit associated with breaking the standoff around classes. The "maximally minimal class" proposal was based off of a proposal I made.<br/><br/>These days I've been working on my own vision for the "future of coding". I'm a big fan of Alan Kay and Brett Victor. From Alan Kay, I really love the idea that we need to shift from mechanical to ecological thinking. From Brett Victor I love the concept that the "digital medium" needs a separate concept of "authors/authoring" that is separate from engineering/programming. The fact that programming languages have been a tool for both is part of what holds us back. I'm working on a unique sort of universal IR binary format inspired by DNA, and a programming/modeling language inspired by cellular biology. Happy to chat about any of this stuff, but mostly here to see what everyone else is doing! Looking forward to learning from all the brilliant minds here.

Hello everyone! I'm excited to join this community! I’m a nurse with a strong interest in coding, and I’m eager to learn the basics and start building my skills. As someone coming from a healthcare background, I’m looking to explore how coding can complement my experience, and perhaps open up new career opportunities down the road.<br/>I’m curious to know where to begin and what resources would be best for someone just starting out. Also, I’d love to hear how others taught themselves to code and any tips you have for a beginner. Looking forward to learning from all of you!

I work in the diamond trading industry (part of a small family business specializing in loose diamond exports) but I've immersed myself in self-education curating research for design theory, philosophy of technology, media studies, educational theories, philosophy of science, and cognitive science for quite a while. All this culminated into a project idea : A small catalogue of novel edtech interface patterns that introduce a new way of online learning, teaching. I have recently enrolled in an offline UX bootcamp to materialize some of the ideas and was introduced to this group by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Pranav Pramod</span>. <br/>> <br/>> My interest in the tool for thought space is to figure out if we can conceive of entirely new pedagogies via material properties unique to the computing medium instead of replicating linear ways of teaching online like the way LMSes operate, in short interested in novel edtech interfaces

Hi, I'm Bill, and I have been following this group for a while now.<br/><br/>I began programming as a teenager back in the 1970's (first language Autocoder assembly on an IBM 1401 computer.)<br/><br/>I got an Apple II computer in 1979, which led to me dropping out of graduate school and becoming a game programmer. I wrote Pinball Construction Set, probably my main claim to fame. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_Construction_Set">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_Construction_Set</a><br/><br/>After that I had a long career as a programmer working at Apple Computer, Electronic Arts, The 3DO Company, Sony Computer Entertainment, and finally at Google, where I worked on Chrome, Native Client, WebAssembly, and the V8 Javascript compiler and runtime.<br/><br/>I have been interested in building editor-like tools for constructing programs for a long time. Pinball Construction Set allowed users to build their own video pinball games. At Sony, I worked on a set of libraries for building editors which was widely used internally and eventually open-sourced: <a href="https://github.com/SonyWWS/ATF">https://github.com/SonyWWS/ATF</a>. One tool was a node-and-wire realtime procedural audio library, another a Statechart editor.<br/><br/>For the last 10 years I have been working on an editor for diagramming software, using "nodes and wires", but adopting some of the ideas behind Harel Statecharts. I will share this work on that thread.

Hey everyone! :wave:<br/>My name is Guido Woda, and I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm a Uni dropout of Sound Engineering and Software Engineering, but have been working in software since 2006 nevertheless.<br/>I've always had a particular interest in software design and architecture and I've focused my career mostly on web-based enterprise products. But in the last few years I've struggled to find meaning in being a <em>cog in the machine</em>, so I started to feel disconnected from the craft and eventually burned out and took a necessary time off. Last year (2024) I got back into the industry, but during my time off I found that I enjoyed working on creative collaborative projects, and I didn't want to lose this. So a few months ago I started looking for content creators that could get me to reconnect to the craft, and that's how I found the podcast and this community! :blush:<br/><br/>I'm really enjoying everything I read here and listen on the podcast. I don't know how yet, but I'd love to be able to contribute someday :heart_hands:

Hi! I’m Bill Mill aka llimllib, I’ve been making occasional little experiments on the web for 20 years now<br/><br/>I’m currently interested in thinking through what it looks like to organize web communities without the Big Web, though I haven’t released anything in that direction yet.<br/><br/>I’m generally pretty scared of collaboration, but I’ve been inspired by a lot of your work, so here I am :wave:

Hey everyone! I'm Jeff. Thought I'd try a new online community and this seemed like a good one. Like a lot of you, I assume, I think about this topic a lot. Maybe too much. Some notable background: back in the day I coined and popularized webhooks to try and make the web more programmable. I created a bunch of stuff to encourage and support adoption including a free tool called localtunnel that a friend turned into a company called Ngrok, if anybody's used that. Later I helped prototype Docker and built a bunch of Docker stuff in the early days. Like a tiny PaaS called Dokku. I kind of just like building what I think needs to exist and then quickly moving on.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm in the Berkeley area if anybody wants to meet up or if there's an existing FoC in-person thing around here. I've kind of really been into the old Bell Labs projects Plan 9 and Inferno lately. If there's any Plan 9 curious people, we're hosting an online hangout / watch party for Plan 9 stuff in my quiet little Discord tomorrow night. Let me know if anybody wants an invite.<br/><br/>Otherwise, here for the vibes and to hopefully meet some cool people if I can remember how. :v:

Hi everyone, I’m Karl. I got into programming in the first place playing visual programming-esque games like LittleBigPlanet as a kid. I love playful and creative interactions for storytelling, teaching, etc.<br/><br/>For more context in the present, I’m a recent Ph.D. graduate from New York University, and I focused on human-computer interaction exploring how we could combine natural creativity, communication, and programming into an interactive communication medium of its own, in a sense. The specific project I did towards that exploration is <a href="https://ktrosenberg.github.io/drawtalking/">DrawTalking (Building Interactive Worlds by Sketching and Speaking),</a> and I’d love to share it here. It’s both my thesis and my playground for coming up with ideas.<br/><br/>Also, I’m really hoping to meet people here! I’m looking forward to conversations and even meet-ups if there are people in the NYC area or nearby. Nice to meet you all in advance!

Hi all! I'm Federico. Originally from Argentina, based in the Netherlands. I've been programming for about 15 years now (yikes!). For almost as long I have dreamed of build a programming tool to replace spreadsheets. The reason for this is that very early on I found Paul Graham's essays and Steve Yegge's rants, and those two set me in a contrarian path of looking for a better way to program. I love programming, but I am very aware of how much crap one has to deal with in order to get something done. I firmly believe (and already start to see) that that no longer needs to be the case, and I'm happy to interact with a community that feels in the same way.<br/><br/>Except for some sparse 1:1 communication with a few people in the open source community, I've been thinking and writing mostly in isolation. I'm now ready to change that and this feels like a great place to open up and start interacting more. I discovered FoC through val.town's blog.<br/><br/>Really looking forward to read your ideas and get some feedback on my work!

Hi all! I'm <a href="https://marci.gunyho.com">Márton</a>, but I usually go by the nickname Marci. I'm in Finland, currently finishing up my PhD related to superconducting quantum computing.<br/><br/>I learned to program fairly late, only during my physics studies in uni. Turns out that I love it, and I'm sure I could have learned it much earlier if it wasn't so hard to get started. So the FoC goal of making programming more accessible strongly resonates with me.<br/><br/>I like to learn new programming languages, I've done Advent of Code with Racket, BQN (a modern variant of APL) and most recently with Pharo Smalltalk (it was great!). Another FoC-adjacent thing I like to do is making experimental-ish electronic music - I've dabbled in PureData and Supercollider, and also played around quite a bit with VCV Rack. I also sometimes like to do graphics programming (Processing and some GLSL), and I've been involved in the demoscene in Helsinki a little bit. And I of course love video games, I would like to find enough time some day to make my own.<br/><br/>I think I was primed for FoC ideas by noticing the awful state of most of the software I see around me, especially during my PhD studies working with lab control electronics and doing science in general. At some point I came across Bret Victor's talks on HN, and I was immediately hooked. After that I've been continuously absorbing related material like Ink &amp; Switch, the local-first movement etc. After a while, I came across the podcast, and I was struck by how great it is. It has so many things I like - the interesting topics, fun banter, and the weird musical interludes and the overall off-beat format. I love it.<br/><br/>I'm excited to see what's going on in this forum!

Hi everyone, I'm Matt (<a href="https://x.com/mattrasmus">https://x.com/mattrasmus</a>). I got into future of coding/thinking topics originally when I wrote my own note-taking app called KeepNote (<a href="https://keepnote.org/">https://keepnote.org/</a>, unmaintained) during grad school. The experience made me appreciate how powerful it can be to refer back to previous ideas and make new connections in my research (computational biology at the time). I am now interested in how note-taking can be viewed as a form of personal Data Engineering. That is, you could imagine an individual benefiting from similar activities that you find at a company-wide level: data capture into an unorganized data lake, ETLs that transform data into analysis friendly forms, personal dashboards and alerts of things that are important to you, etc.<br/><br/>More recently in my day job, I developed a flexible workflow engine redun (<a href="https://github.com/insitro/redun">https://github.com/insitro/redun</a>), mainly for scientific compute. However, the project has made me think again about the opportunities of blending workflow engines with personal note databases. The development of LLMs acting as assistants to help autogenerate code or call tools also seems like a chance to lower the bar for automatic compute over ones thoughts captured in their notes. I'm not entirely sure yet how it all fits together yet, but I've been trying prototypes and reading up on other people's explorations of these ideas.<br/><br/>I have followed the podcast and Ink and Switch work for years for inspiration on these topics. Looking forward to meeting you all and discussing more.

Hi all! I'm <a href="https://www.andyta.ng/">Andy</a>, a student currently studying robot learning and AI for real-world/verifiable tasks. I've previously crossed paths with several (generally more experienced / into HCI) folks in circles like these, and given my interest in these subjects I thought I'd join and hopefully meet some cool people! In terms of experience, I've been coding all my life, previously interned at Replit---which really changes your perspective on the conventional idea of who is a coder---and generally spawn side projects fast enough that they get shoved in a document so I don't try to act on all of them at once and leave them all half-finished.<br/><br/>Topics of interest include voice and physical interaction modalities, computer history (fun fact: according to <em><a href="http://friendlyorangeglow.com/">Friendly Orange Glow</a></em> my high school was a significant source of programmers for the PLATO system), and generative software ideas. Excited to meet you all!

Hey hey! I'm Roma. I am based around Paris, France. I love CSS, and everything I do is related to it in one way or another.<br/>		  <br/>I work as a frontend engineer, working on design systems as my main job, and spending my spare time experimenting with CSS and trying to push the boundaries of what is possible with it. And then publishing long and nerdy articles on my personal site with the results. I'm also a CSSWG member. You are welcome to ask me any questions about CSS (on any level — it is important to understand what people struggle with for “simple” stuff as well).<br/>		  <br/>I don't remember how exactly I stumbled upon the Future of Coding podcast: likely, from Mastodon, or from me searching for people talking about some of the Bret Victor's ideas. In many ways, I feel a bit out of my depth (being mostly a self-taught engineer), but I constantly try to get inspiration from very different areas.<br/><br/>In the new year, I am planning to work a bit more on one of my slowly ongoing pet projects (for live CSS explorations and permutations), and might share some progress here if I'll manage to fight my anxiety :slightly_smiling_face:

Hello all.  I’m Chad, an old saxophonist turned programmer turned (after 30 years) VC with BlueYard Capital.  I spent many years in the early Ruby community.  Wrote some books, organized a bunch of conferences, helped write Ruby’s package manager, managed a bunch of people, etc.  I’m a fan of the local first software movement (I met <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Maggie Appleton</span> at the first local first conference in Berlin earlier this year).  I love things like esoteric programming languages and other fun wastes of time.  My colleague Ben Scofield and I organized a conference in Iceland in 2018 called The Future of Software Development, which makes it surprising to me that I’m only now joining this community.  I am professionally based in New York (as both a tech person and a jazz musician) but I travel constantly and hope to make it to a London meetup one of these days.  Currently in flight on the way home from London as it happens.  Though I’m a VC I still write code almost daily.  I also have some <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x04A9Fb82b53eB2e7eFC4F44B829Ae4353e19bFFb/7fXRPPhJ32SKLBRpookIZyfEKpsF0amD3g69QCzYMHI">pet ideas</a>  for generative software development that might be both interesting and controversial.  Currently spending what free time I have learning about mechanism design and game theory.

Hi! I'm Guy, a software engineer from and based in London. I'm interested in expressive and joyful applications of software directed at making music, algorithmic poetry and other creative forms. In my day job I work on interactive music learning sites - I can share links if there's interest (am mindful that the guidelines suggest to not talk too much about the company you're working for), and have in the past worked in data vis and creative technologist roles. On the side I enjoy using tools like Max MSP to explore ideas in the interests I mentioned above. I appreciated the sound of this community - the ethos really resonated with me and am curious to dig in!

Hello! I'm <a href="https://mimireyburn.com/">Mimi</a>. I'm a design engineer / machine learning engineer / AI creative technologist from London.<br/><br/>I like to apply tech and AI to try and make the world a little more intuitive, accessible and hopefully an easier place to be, although sometimes my projects are just plain silly.<br/><br/>Currently, in my work, I'm exploring how genAI can improve inclusivity and access to cancer patient information (leaflets, websites). I first heard about Future of Coding from following Matt Webb and TodePond on twitter. Also, heard great reviews from everyone at Side Project Saturday, hosted by Steve and Mini at tldraw. It's about time I joined :))<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of embeddings, e-ink, <a href="https://mimireyburn.com/Misc./Mimi's+Website+Collection">silly websites</a> and visual explanations on the internet. I'm trying to share my work more.<br/><br/>Looking forward to meeting you all!

Hi :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>I'm <a href="https://bazlightyear.info">Baz</a>. In general I work on new communications networks that use powerful cryptography to reduce our dependency on platforms and deliver an internet as magical as it was meant to be. I've really loved exploring local first software, p2p systems, blockchain, ZK proofs, oblivious compute - and see those tools as our best hope for liberating the web. Would love to jam with anyone that has a strong opinion about that, for or against. I grew up, live and work in London, studied philosophy at uni; spent lots of time on cross-platform identity tools :heart:

:earth_africa: Hi all, I'm Luke Stanley. :keyboard: I started coding when I was 12 on a BBC Micro. I wanted to play games, but the disk drive didn't work, so I learned BASIC. :computer:When I got an IBM PC, I was fascinated by Visual Basic's RAD tools. I explored the Win32 API, ActiveX, OLE (interesting component systems), multimedia, and networking—teaching myself as much as I could.<br/><br/>:cd: There's a big gap between the rich multimedia learning tools I explored as a child—like <b>Encarta</b>, Ancient Lands, and <b>The Way Things Work</b> CD-ROMs—and how we can explore our personal, internal worlds with computers.<br/>:art: It inspires me to explore visual language, hypertext, information retrieval, generative technology, semantic desktops, and self-assembling knowledge graphs to bridge that gap—something I'm still working on.<br/><br/>:robot_face: At 16, I got into what we'd now call machine learning. Inspired by Paul Graham's "A Plan For Spam" and my curiosity about Myers-Briggs categories, I created a dataset to predict introversion vs. extroversion from text samples using POPFile (a Bayesian spam filter) repurposed for a personality classification task called "Mindprise."<br/><br/>Around this time, I first interacted with futurists and AI safety figures like Eliezer Yudkowsky via IRC chat. I became an early supporter of the Singularity Institute (now MIRI) and learned about them through a memetics group on the same IRC server.<br/><br/>:lion_face::handshake: I met Lion Kimbro through an online BBC Magazine article, and we became friends. Lion got me into Carl Sagan, <b>The Great Story</b>, and making visual language lifemaps.<br/><br/>Around 2008, after Lion showed me his lifemap, I started the <tt>ThoughtTrail</tt> project, a metadata knowledge graph plugin system powering a contextual search tool that identified conversation topics in MSN Messenger and Skype chats.<br/><br/>It displayed Google Images and YouTube videos in a sidebar, with Wikipedia information accessible via a Python plugin. Worried about privacy issues, I pivoted to exploring a Visual Language Wiki (Cavepaint). I’m still interested in semi-automatic timelines and knowledge outline generation.<br/><br/>:footprints: I'm really intrigued by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Maggie Appleton</span>'s "<b>Barefoot Developers</b>" concept, I want to see spreadsheets, databases, and apps accessible and interoperable for non-developers.<br/>I want my 70-year-old mum, who isn't technical, to create tools for the cat charity she supports. Helping people move beyond basic tables to databases and apps they can share, understand, and control is important and will unlock a lot. I agree with Alan Kay: the information revolution has barely started.<br/><br/>:mag_right: I built a search tool for my ChatGPT conversation dump containing over 4000 conversations.<br/><br/>:world_map: <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Amelia Wattenberger</span>'s <a href="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/evolving-the-infinite-canvas">visual representations showing the same data as lists, tables, grids, maps</a>, I think with D3 and embeddings.<br/><br/>:thinking_face: I'm curious about personal AI assistants for meaning prediction and emotional insight—what I think is important and why.<br/><br/>:male-technologist: Daniel Harris introduced me to the Future of Coding group, who I think was introduced by Steve Ruiz of Tldraw. More recently, I connected with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> via Lion’s Internet Office on Discord.<br/><br/>:pleading_face: We should map out probable suffering and its remediation, improve our collective intelligence, and be mindful of the Fermi Paradox—treading carefully towards Pandora's box.<br/><br/><b>Some interests include:</b><br/><br/>:blue_book: Restricted vocabulary explanations like <b>Thing Explainer</b> by XKCD<br/>:link: Improving representation and connectivity in embedding spaces<br/>:robot_face: Fine-tuning small models for explanations, and on my ChatGPT dump to predict what I might say!<br/>:cyclone: Exploring deep state-space models, training continuation, small models, and constraint solvers<br/>:inbox_tray: Addressing information overload with unified systems<br/>:world_map: Automatically creating visual maps, emoji topic outlines, ontologies, and hierarchical knowledge graphs. I made a Paul Graham essay map using embeddings<br/>:orange_heart: <a href="https://jjh.org/we-feel-fine">We Feel Fine</a> by <a href="https://jjh.org">Jonathan Harris</a><br/>:globe_with_meridians: Map-making to connect personal understanding with broader knowledge, and developing semi-automatic timelines<br/>:boom: I'm curious what high-impact solutions there are for big problems, and just having fun playing and exploring.

Hello!<br/><br/>I'm Conrad from London. I started writing code in Macromedia Flash 8 in like 2006 because I wanted to make cool shapes, and make my animations do things that weren't possible by hand.<br/>I wound up studying computer sciecne and working in various startups in London - at the moment I'm doing a bit of Freelance Software Engineering and Teaching code too! I'd really like to do more teaching.<br/><br/>I'm only just discovering the Future of Code ecosystem - spiritually it reminds me of why I started coding. So I'm grateful it exists! Heard of it through a friend called Greg who pointed me in the direction of Todepond.<br/><br/>Currently trying to do more Digital Gardening, whatever takes my fancy at any given time, putting out lots of half finished stuff. What the kids are calling scrappy fiddles perhaps.<br/><br/>Interested in Maps, Music (broadly, but also the particularly niche of barbershop quartet singing), Visualisations, Multi-modal interfaces.<br/><br/><a href="http://conradgodfrey.com">conradgodfrey.com</a>

Hi, friends!<br/><br/>I'm a former software developer turned computational artist, previously from Sydney and now in LA. Finally getting on here after meeting some lovely people at the Ink &amp; Switch unconf.<br/><br/>Programming has been a part of me for basically my entire life, but what it means to me has changed a lot over time. From "it's for fun and curiosity" to "it's for making stuff" to "it's for beautiful and powerful feats of engineering" to "it's for making beautiful things whether or not they're useful" to "oh that's art actually", which will hopefully someday lead me back to "it's for fun and curiosity" again.<br/><br/>I've felt spiritually connected to the FoC-verse for a long time, which (like most people here I'm assuming) began because almost every moment I spend interacting with a computer I'm trying not to breathe in all the wasted potential. That said, these days my interest is more in the potential of computation as an artistic medium, so I'm looking at creative and alternative models of computation more through the lens of "what's beautiful and meaningful?" than "what's more useful and less maddening?"<br/><br/>I used to post lil screen recordings of things I made on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/sgentle">@sgentle</a><a href="https://twitter.com/sgentle))">)</a>, these days I'm mostly on Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/_sgentle">@_sgentle</a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/_sgentle))">)</a> and trying to get started on Mastodon (<a href="https://mastodon.social/@sgentle">@sgentle@mastodon.social</a><a href="https://mastodon.social/@sgentle))">)</a>. I have <a href="https://x.com/sgentle/status/1092414959877640192">a whole lot</a> of <a href="https://x.com/sgentle/status/1028376365614030848">half-finished</a> <a href="https://x.com/sgentle/status/1095355139534143489">unreleased stuff</a> from my making-art-but-don't-know-it transitional period that I'm still figuring out what to do with, but sometime soon hopefully I should start putting them somewhere. Meanwhile, here are a few actually released things: <a href="https://demos.samgentle.com/flourish/">Flourish</a>, <a href="https://demos.samgentle.com/automata-by-example/">Automata by Example</a>, <a href="https://demos.samgentle.com/markov-contact/">Markov Contact</a>.<br/><br/>I spent a while being kinda isolated and it didn't work so well, so now I'm trying the other one. Definitely reach out if anything I've said seems interesting, you're into art/tech type things, or you just feel inexplicably drawn to weird and beautiful forms of computation :)

Hello, everybody.<br/>My name is <a href="https://turkmenson.com/">Medet Ahmetson</a> and I am launching a new social network where people create a community to work on the project together. The long term vision of the social network is a program synthesis, when a computer can fulfil the user's intention. But counter intuitively as most people try to solve it by improving AI, innovating on end user programming, I decided its better to make a place on internet when a non-technical people and programmers collaborate together.<br/><br/>Innovating the way how we use computers, decentralization is one of the dreams that I had since my teenage years. I formed it from old and mostly classic books in Computer Science. I am from Turkmenistan, a landlocked country in the Central Asia. In technology wise Turkmenistan stays behind than most of the countries. As such in late 2000s the Internet was quite expensive. Therefore, I could learn programming, understand how computers work only through a tiny budget, that allowed me to have a 5/25 megabytes per week limit. This allowed me to download, books the smallest in the size, dense in the coverage. As such those books were from the 80s, 70s. Rarely was something that was from late 2000s.<br/><br/>Despite learning the new technology, not different than todays tech stack, I was trained and got the knowledge from the pre-Linux/pre-Windows, immersed in the golden era of the hackers, stories of OS wars, how programming languages evolved. And telnet jokes.<br/><br/>On my free time, all these years I tried to achieve the program synthesis through various spectrums, following OS tutorials to create my own. Or writing my own programming languages from scratch. And also going into different programming language techniques such as Logic, Symbolic programming.<br/><br/>Here, I would like to find a like minded people who would be with me in a team to work on the social network. Or I hope I can get a support here. And that you guys will build your innovative stuff on the social network too.

Hi all.<br/>My name is <a href="https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/">Thomas van Binsbergen</a> and I am an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam. I teach programming languages, programming concepts, compilers and software evolution. My research is on software language design, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and programming environments. Java and Haskell are my native languages, and I very much used to be a back-end code kinda guy. Nowadays I hardly code anymore, except for the occasional interpreter, and spend my time engrossed in mathematical abstractions and inference rules (the word <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> was looking for in one of the podcasts), e.g., writing formal operational semantics, and writing research papers (as evidenced by the use of "e.g.,").<br/><br/>My interest in FoC is primarily because of my work on novel programming environments, legal DSLs, and rule-based, high-level, declarative languages. I found FoC through the Podcast on Laurence Diver's Rule(s) of Code paper which struck a chord with me (both the paper and the podcast) because of the forward, out-of-the-box thinking that characterises FoC. In the past few years my students and I spent effort on the <a href="https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/files/papers/eflint.pdf">eFLINT DSL</a>, a language for formalising interpretations of laws and applying them in different contexts (case-based reasoning, access control, verification). Another research line is on "<a href="https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/files/papers/sle22-exp.pdf">exploratory programming</a>" in which programmers (but we target domain-experts such as data scientists, not necessarily software engineers) can experiment with alternative execution paths and compare outputs and effects. Most of my work is published at SPLASH and I will be attending again this year; so perhaps we will run into each other there.<br/><br/>The primary reasons for me to join are to get further inspired by the interesting discussions and demonstrations that are shared here and to find potential collaborators from industry or academia in joint (interdisciplinary) projects. I mention interdisciplinary here because, as a back-end kinda guy engrossed in abstractions, I certainly need help from people that can provide creative insights related to visual design and interfaces!<br/><br/>Looking forward to meeting you all!

Hello everyone! My name is Daniel and my handle everywhere is <em>dahacouk</em>. I found the FoC whilst also finding the Local-First community and attending the meeting in Berlin this year. I think the main thing that drives me is the need to be in control of my environment, be that physical or digital. Not the easiest theme to pick for one's life's work, but hey!<br/><br/>I don't code anymore, but I do long to build little useful collaborative apps without coding. It all started way back with a ZX81... Spectrum... Amiga... PC... Mac. I studied art in the late 80s. Ran an ISP in the mid 90s. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ETwSBxKeF6i634c4lb2-GOI4niRfGcgTxL2pntXxiMg/edit#heading=h.cvl3gpy4xt5x">Dreamed and talked</a> of having interoperability and open protocols ubiquitous in every sector through the 00s, and started a nonprofit open source research project. Started building demonstrations in the early 10s with EU research funding. Arrived in the 20s with a team and the beginnings of an app to build mini apps: <em>like if Excel could build apps and not just spreadsheets</em>, and we could email them to each other. My projects are on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dahacouk">LinkedIn</a> as I don't want to break the rules! :wink: So, now I'm immersed in: no-code, local-first and malleable-software isms. I've <a href="../share-your-work/1727700811.071079.html">shared our work</a> in #share-your-work<br/><br/>What I'm most interested in is how end-users can build and alter simple apps. Rather than building a typical fine-grained programming environment, I'm wondering about what people do most when interacting with services and data in their daily lives: create and modify things, manage relationships between things. List, filter, analyse and select/group things. What minimal set of user-interface and compute blocks could be configured and combined to provide a viable environment for people to manage their digital lives?<br/><br/>So, yes, I'm excited about never having to go to a website or app (where my data is currently siloed) ever again. For instance, I'd like to have a consistent shopping interface that I can configure and tailor to my needs through which I can access all shops: a personal Amazon if you will. So, I guess that means services become headless? Luckily the ubiquity of APIs makes this dream more viable. The trick is to make it understandable and attractive – and I'm beginning to think that this is the 'not the easy part'! :wink: Look forward to hanging out in FoC and sharing our experiments. Cheers!

Hi everyone!<br/><br/>I'm Tomas - I have been lurking here for some time, but I thought it may be time to join properly. I've been involved in various things around programming languages (functional programming in F#, type systems for tracking context information, type providers and tools for data science) - but recently my interest has been stateful and interactive "programming systems" (as opposed to "programming languages"). With <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Joel Jakubovic</span> and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span>, we wrote <a href="https://tomasp.net/techdims/">Technical dimensions of programming systems</a>. I've also been trying to make sense of some interesting past programming systems like <a href="https://tomasp.net/commodore64/">BASIC</a> and I post various other things at <a href="https://tomasp.net/">https://tomasp.net/</a><br/><br/>After happy 10 years in the UK, I moved back to Prague and I'm now an assistant professor at Charles University (and we have some funding for post-docs and PhD students interested in those topics!) I will also be organising the &lt;Programming&gt; 2025 conference in Prague in June next year! <a href="https://2025.programming-conference.org/">https://2025.programming-conference.org/</a>

Hi everyone! I'm Josh Sunshine, an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. I lead the <a href="https://penrose.cs.cmu.edu/">Penrose</a> team. Penrose is a  platform for conceptual diagramming. In Penrose, you declare what you want to be true of your diagram and Penrose automatically lays out your diagram to meet your goals. Under the hood, we use some interesting differentiable geometry, numeric optimization, and compiler tricks to make it work.<br/>I'm broadly interested in research at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and programming languages (PL). That intersection seems closely connected to this group. I also run an annual research workshop called <a href="https://2025.plateau-workshop.org/">PLATEAU</a> that focuses on PL+HCI which may interest some of you.

Hi everyone!<br/>I'm leading a research project at JetBrains that aims to reimagine software development and explore such ideas as minimalist programming language design, unification of different programming paradigms, and novel ways of working with code. It's called Ludwig after Ludwig Wittgenstein.

Hi everyone! I'm <a href="https://github.com/kaBeech">Kyle</a>!<br/><br/>The Future Of Coding podcast won my heart about a year ago by being the first tech podcast I found where I got the impression that the hosts had read <a href="https://xkcd.com/917/">Douglas Hofstadter</a>. It's my favorite podcast short of <a href="https://cocaineandrhinestones.com/">Cocaine &amp; Rhinestones</a>.<br/><br/>I'm a Pharmacy Technician and part-time Software Engineer (slowly working towards a full-time role). I'm into punk culture, Functional Programming, and the relationship between AI and human cognition.<br/><br/>I've been aware of the Slack for almost as long as the podcast, but I'm socially anxious and avoided joining until I had a reason to do so. But I just published a project inspired by Beyond Efficiency by Dave Ackley (see #share-your-work) so I figured it was time to come home. I'm happy to be here and meet y'all! :blue_heart:

I wrote this for the new forum, but it won’t let me post, so I’ll put it here:<br/><br/>Guyren Howe<br/><br/><a href="mailto:guyren@relevantlogic.com">guyren@relevantlogic.com</a><br/><a href="http://frest.substack.com">frest.substack.com</a><br/>@unclouded<br/><a href="http://lydb.xyz">lydb.xyz</a><br/><br/>My major thesis for the future of coding is that SQL is a gaping wound in the computer industry.<br/><br/>The relational model is a straightforward way to use declarative First Order Logic to retrieve and manipulate data. But SQL is a horrid way to achieve this.<br/><br/>Datalog (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog#:~:text=Datalog%20is%20a%20declarative%20logic,behavior%20and%20properties%20from%20Prolog">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog#:~:text=Datalog%20is%2&hellip;</a>.), which is basically the pattern matching that all the languages are acquiring now, but for data, is the natural alternative.<br/><br/>In fact, most of most business software (heck, most of most software of any kind) can in fact be expressed through the relational model. The only parts of typical software that needs to be written in a Turing Complete language are:<br/>• side-effecting things (e.g. sending email)<br/>• efficiency-focused computation (e.g. signal processing)<br/>• some types of complex sequential logic (e.g. some aspects of UIs)<br/>Everything else can and should be expressed in Datalog.<br/><br/>The advantage of so doing for developers would be software that is more robust, simple and flexible.<br/><br/>The advantage for non-developers is that e.g. FileMaker demonstrates that non-developers find manipulating relations natural, so this is also a way to let non-programmers do computing more easily.<br/><br/>I’ve developed some theory around what software like that would look like. I discuss this at <a href="http://frest.substack.com">frest.substack.com</a>. Maybe start with <a href="https://frest.substack.com/p/what-is-frest">https://frest.substack.com/p/what-is-frest</a>

Hello! I've spent the last year of my life going through the Bret Victor -> Anarchist pipeline (no idea if this pipeline is unique to me or not).<br/><br/>I started programming doing undergraduate physics research in materials simulation. I really enjoyed it and loved making 3Blue1Brown-esque animations to visualize research concepts that were tricky to fit in my head or on a whiteboard.<br/><br/>After finishing my undergraduate physics program I got a job as a software developer for a big tech medical software company. I was optimistic that I could write code that would help people, but I spent 4 years working on projects that ranged from being potentially marginally helpful to a handful of healthcare IT workers, to projects primarily designed (IMO) to extract more money out of patients. Pushing back on these projects turned out to be too hard from me, and eventually decided the nice paycheck was not not worth the sisyphean task of trying to work against the financial interests of the US healthcare system.<br/><br/>Looking for "alternative" approaches to programming, where motivations are centered around positive human values, I first came across Bret Victor's work. From there I found things like the FoC podcast, the Recurse Center, a gold mine of recorded Strange Loop talks, and lovely folks on Mastodon (me: <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@JohnWithAnH">Johnwithanh@hachyderm.io</a>). It was amazing to suddenly find so many new programming concepts that look more like fundamental truths, and less like arbitrary design choices. Lots of people have put a lot of thought into how design programming languages/tools for humans, and carefully consider the effects they have on other humans. Why didn't anyone tell me sooner?! (obvious now, but I didn't  know what functional programming was despite being a "professional" developer and completing a CS minor)<br/><br/>I decided to quit my job without something else lined up (super privileged that this was an option), and spent a few months at the Recurse Center. Having the chance to build and learn whatever interested me and doing it with other people doing the same was wonderfully liberating! It reassured to me that programming could still be an edifying practice for me, despite its adjacency to some negative dominating forces of our current world.<br/><br/>After Recurse I found a physics professor at a near by university looking for a research software engineer to build a visual programming system for researchers to prototype new MRI signal processing techniques. I honestly couldn't believe my luck! I started few months ago and have been building a simple node and wire system on top of tldraw for the UI.  I'm excited to continue to learn from previous work in this area, and figure out an approach that works well for my problem domain.<br/><br/>Learning a host of new paradigms has had a huge impact on how I write code, but what I appreciate most about these new paradigms and the communities adjacent to them, is the affect it has had on my worldview. I feel much more confident now than I did a year ago that the good and bad of our world today was never an inevitable conclusion, and that most obvious future is likewise undetermined. I'm hopeful that I can find sustainable ways to push for a more humane future of computation with people in communities like this one!

Hi I'm Polly. I care about security and other things. I've done a lot of hacking the past 5 years, a lot of cryptography but also webs security, binary exploitation and whatnot. Almost all of it was in the context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)">CTFs</a>. Back when I was a kid I learnt programming through creative coding, where I wrote a lot of games and simulations and nonsense programs. I have a <a href="https://blog.polly.computer">website</a> with very little on it.<br/><br/>Lately I've been very interested in thinking about building secure software. It's kinda the problem that my field is unable to solve, or even really think about. I really like Rust because it made a good push towards that.<br/>I got very sucked into a bunch of the blog posts on <a href="http://todepond.com">todepond.com</a> after re-discovering Lu's mastodon, and have since binged some of the future of coding stuff and read/watched <em>so</em> many of the cited works.

Heya all,<br/><br/>Just found this community through weird youtube->todepond->twitter->ink&switch swirl of events. I am Piotr generally electronic/software engineer (I guess this would be computer engineer) extremely interested in building experimental software and tools. I spend a lot of my time delving into Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence topics, which you can see on my github: <a href="https://github.com/PeterWaIIace">https://github.com/PeterWaIIace</a><br/><br/>However, I came here to share my largest project so far called <b>EyeGestures</b>. It is <b>python</b> (for now) <b>library</b> enabling engineers to build gaze-driven interfaces just by using built-in webcam (so you can make your own gaze tracker or eye tracker in seconds now - no need for expensive hardware nor license!). No servers required, everything runs locally: <a href="https://github.com/NativeSensors/EyeGestures">https://github.com/NativeSensors/EyeGestures</a><br/><br/>Hope you will enjoy, and look forward to chat with you all!

Hello! I’m Adam Davidson.  I was introduced to the podcast by a friend recently and love it! I’ve only listened to a few of the episodes so far and have really loved the topics they choose and generally the zoomed out perspective of programming they tend to take.  I already feel like I have learned a lot and found some people who like to think about the same sorts of things that I do.<br/><br/>I am a software engineer without a particular focus since my interest seems to take me in a different direction every month.  a recurring interest is the intersection of computation with music and art.<br/><br/><a href="https://adam26davidson.github.io/harmony-visualizer/">Here is a website I made back in 2018 that let’s you visua&hellip;</a> (please forgive the design / font choice I was in college :joy:)<br/><br/>oops hit enter before finishing…<br/><br/>I majored in math in college and got terrible grades as I had undiagnosed ADD and was more interested in making music and silly websites (but somehow made it through).<br/><br/>I grew up in Japan and speak Japanese but cannot read Kanji above grade 4 level (there are too many)<br/><br/>some recent projects I have been working on:<br/>• Hardware x software project to create little audio  / midi processing modules that snap together with magnetic connectors and are configurable in a browser with a max msp style editor. So far I have a working PCB designed in keyCAD and have rewritten the code 4 times (!) from arduinoIDE C++ > platformio with C++ > stmCubeIDE with C > embedded rust <br/>• Music theory based chord progression improvisation instrument using a ps4 controller connected to a raspberry pi with small display attached, and a codebase and UI i (stupidly) built with python and TKInter (!)<br/>• For work I do semi - boring azure cloud development in C# and Java (although I have come to LOVE these languages)<br/>I am very excited to explore what people are up to here and (crap I hit enter again pfffaaaaaeifuveurv) learning together!

Hi :wave:  I’m Jim Kring. I co-authored LabVIEW for Everyone (back when people read books) and I’m working to self-host a visual programming language. I’ve been using LabVIEW for nearly 30 years, and a few years back I started exploring re-writing LabVIEW in LabVIEW. I’ve got a lot of interesting ideas in this space (many of them working) and am now starting to implement them in modern web technologies and with AI co-pilot capabilities. I’m also very interested in visual languages as a means for more efficiently interacting with AI (and parallel compute targets) as a means for having visibility into proposed actions by AI agents and enable human accountability for such systems to keep them safe. I’m looking forward to sharing ideas and successes. Kind Regards, Jim<br/><a href="https://create.vi">https://create.vi</a> <br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimkring">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimkring</a>

hello, i’m <a href="https://agnescameron.info/">agnes</a> — I work as a technician and a lecturer at university of the arts london’s creative computing institute, and also work on games/writing/art-related things.<br/><br/>I spend a lot of time thinking about how people develop a sense of agency in relation to technology. I recently came across the tadi web ‘slippy mindset’ page + thought it was a great articulation of something I often try to get across in my teaching and technical work — that there’s always more than one way to do something.<br/><br/>I’m also really interested in collective knowledge structures and tools for describing/realising them — I’ve run a reading group for a few years now called the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fXfCHIDHeX1qqdZPSkj2chz0AVdvBR4-46-U87hM0sc/edit">Knowledge Arrangement Reading Group</a> (it’s an open group if anyone here wants to join) + am also an enthusiastic (if intermittent) wikipedia editor.<br/><br/>right now, I’m doing a <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/become-a-2024-bellingcat-technical-writing-fellow/">technical writing fellowship</a> with Bellingcat around diverse satellite imaging indices, thinking a lot about ‘meta-methods’ for thinking about imaging as a physical process. I’m also just starting a research project around developing knitting software, and also learning to make DIY synths (in the autumn I’m going to run a ‘circuit diagram reading group’ at the CCI where we make synthesisers together from scratch).<br/><br/>I think it’s really cool that this space exists! If anyone is based in london and wants to come visit the CCI / hang out and talk about coding things lmk :slightly_smiling_face:

Hard to follow after Karl's lovely intro above, but I'll try! :see_no_evil:<br/><br/>I'm <b>Jase</b>, a big nerd and product / software person. I'm an aspiring poet, blogger, entrepreneur and many other things that are still stretching their legs to hopefully one day make it off the ground.<br/><br/>I learned to code by customizing Myspace layouts for my junior high friends and their (very cool) bands. I failed out of Computer Engineering in college, did a bunch of soul searching, and eventually got my degree in Accounting to save face. I worked as an accountant for <b>3 whole months</b> before selling everything I owned and buying a one-way ticket to the Pacific Northwest to hitchhike and couch-surf my way to a more fitting future.<br/><br/><br/>My current career passion is making small processes that help focus a team's energy toward an actual problem that real people care about. This is a hurricane of pain and frustration, but when it works, it's so incredibly satisfying that I can't help but throw myself back in.<br/><br/>I care deeply about people on an individual level. I want to help shape a future that focuses on human-scale problems with human-scale solutions. I believe scale kills good products.<br/><br/>I'm currently developing an app that tells local stories anywhere in the US, with my business partner and very good friend. More importantly, we're building a collection of systems that help us make things and get feedback from real people. My ultimate goal is to use these systems to solve many small problems in unlame ways. I hope to start writing about these systems in the near future.<br/><br/><br/>I'm looking forward to exploring this space, and I'd love to have <a href="https://calendly.com/jasepellerin/30min">a 1-1 chat</a> with any of you about <b>anything at all</b>. Please don't hesitate to reach out, I'd love to hear from you :v::skin-tone-2:

Hi all!<br/><br/>I'm John, a backend software engineer in Seoul, specializing in AI with a personal interest in visualization and media-related programming.<br/><br/>I discovered this community by chance. While organizing my podcast subscriptions. I noticed episodes from FoC featuring Bret Victor and Miller Puckette, and had to listen! In addition to the subject matter, the style of discussion—tendency toward metaphors, mapping out conceptual spaces by considering their logical extremes, attention to useful details for generalization/abstraction—really resonated with me. When I found there was an entire community dedicated to this spirit, I had to join and say hi.<br/><br/>Currently, I'm particularly interested in flowcharts and diagrams-as-code. I'm working on a toy project called <a href="https://isnbh0.github.io/mermazing">mermazing</a>, which aims to add interactivity to mermaid.js graphs. To start with, I've added a feature where hovering over a node in the graph highlights all upstream and downstream nodes. This proved immensely useful for me personally when navigating complex mermaid graphs.<br/>(Small tip: if you work in <a href="https://mermaid.live/">mermaid.live</a>, add <tt>z</tt> to the URL hostname (making it <tt>mermaidz.live</tt>) and you can see my project's version of your mermaid graph!)<br/><br/>I'm excited to be here and look forward to exchanging resources and insights with everyone. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>tl;dr<br/>• <b>Name &amp; Profession &amp; Location</b><br/>    ◦ John, backend software engineer, Seoul<br/>• <b>Discovery</b><br/>    ◦ Found community via FoC podcast episodes (Bret Victor, Miller Puckette)<br/>• <b>Current Interests</b><br/>    ◦ flowcharts, diagrams-as-code<br/>• <b>Projects</b><br/>    ◦ <a href="https://isnbh0.github.io/mermazing/">mermazing</a> — adding interactivity to mermaid.js graphs<br/>        ▪︎ highlights upstream and downstream nodes on hover

Hello, everybody. My name is Marcin and I am a hacker. I found this place after finding a HN thread about Bret Victor, made a bet it would be full of interesting people, and I have won that bet. <br/><br/>I've read some of the introductions here and I wonder where all these people were during my life at academia. I quit my degree - for good reasons - but I do miss having a network to jump into projects with. <br/><br/>I've worked on a lot of smaller projects in different environments- everything between application reverse engineering Android to assisting researchers with biological modelling. An early-learned habit of extreme privacy means I have little to share, unfortunately. <br/><br/>I've joined this place to see if I can learn how to think out of the box more often; what things combine together to make an effective engineer in unexpected ways. I also have a desire to do new things, and I can only hope this place has plenty of unlaid roads to fill.<br/><br/>Finally - if there's anybody within Morocco that wants to meet up, let me know. It just so happens to be where I'm living in the foreseeable future.

Hey everyone,<br/><br/>I’m Geert, an Interaction Designer, who is very interested in the future of programming/coding beyond current paradigms. For my master thesis I worked with Arduino on making a future way of coding using active learning and acting out scenarios as a starting point; Arduino Action (<a href="https://geertroumen.nl/portfolio/index.php?page=action">https://geertroumen.nl/portfolio/index.php?page=action</a> ). For this thesis I did a variety of Bret Victorian prototypes and explorations to see where this could lead me. I have been working at Microsoft Research on the inclusive design for the future of work, with the team who created Project Torino (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-torino/">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-torino/</a>) focussing on tools to help visually impaired children to be more socially aware (<a href="https://geertroumen.nl/portfolio/index.php?page=microsoft">https://geertroumen.nl/portfolio/index.php?page=microsoft</a>). Before that I’ve been doing an internship at LEGO working on the current generation Mindstorms products. Currently I’m working on experience prototyping for products within Accenture Industrial Design.<br/><br/>Besides that I have been teaching teachers Arduino since begin of high school and are very interested in how we can expand the field of programming beyond the textual representations. Given that Excel might be the biggest programming environment created, us technologist might need to rethink what we see as programming.<br/><br/>I’m very looking forward to have some conversations with people within this community on how to move forward, what it would take and what we think is forward to start with. I’m passionate about the view of Bret Victor, but see more problems with technology that his principle, and more problems with this world than that only can be solved with technology. (In my thesis on Arduino Action the lack of togetherness and transparency with the current tools seemed more pressing than direct manipulation for example).<br/><br/>Feel free to write me a message if any of this resonates with you, or if you want to talk about anything. I would love to have some chats, but also preferably in person meeting where we can turn the world around in our imaginations; I’m living in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. So anywhere in the Netherlands is easy, outside might be online first.

Hey everyone! <br/><br/>I am Nicolay. I run my own AI agency, where we are mostly doing more research heavy AI implementations focused on Pharma and Finance but lately also a lot of LLM and automations in the backoffice.<br/><br/>My main background is in LLMs, after I got hooked by GPT2 back in the day :D<br/><br/>ATM, I am also building a new startup on the side to stay up to date and current in the latest tech stacks. We are doing personalized news / content but B2B (competitor insights, market intelligence, tech insights, but also producing personalized newsletters for some publishers based on their content).<br/><br/>If you every have any more AI heavy questions in especially LLMs or traditional Ml/NLP, do not hesitate to reach out! <br/><br/>At the moment I am looking for a Frontend dev if anyone knows a good one (for a landing page).

Hello everyone!<br/><br/>I'm currently doing a Master degree in Dublin, Ireland; before that I used to work at a startup in China for quite a few years as a software developer. They've had great ambitions of revolutionize the current computer-assisted learning situation, but they made a series of bad decision at bad timings, got hit with China's brutal lockdown policy, and eventually gradually fell off; and now I alone carry on with their ideal.<br/><br/>Back in the startup a big topic we tried to work on was to improve the production and the distribution process of educational materials, which led me to research about different ways of content authoring, which include end-user programming things à la HyperCard and Authorware, which itself eventually puts Future of Coding on my radar.<br/><br/>I've been aware of Future of Coding for nearly a year now but decided not to reach out until now. I'm looking forward to meet more like-minded people and possibly work on things together - although my current focus has shifted a lot due to real life circumstances, that dream of using computers to change education for the better isn't something that I'm willing to give up.<br/><br/>Thank you all and have a good day!

Hi from the sunny UK! I am a software engineer that recently found out about this community and I keep reading and learning about different projects. Some ideas I've seen while looking related articles/projects resemble some of mine, usually as a better expression of mine, so it feels like this is a very interesting place for me at this time, mainly to explore.<br/><br/>At this stage, where I am figuring out a lot of things, I'm interested to learn more about what others are working on and discuss about projects or directions/concepts in general until maybe I find something to devote more time into, more seriously than just like a day of experiments.<br/><br/>Can also be reached in Mastodon here <a href="https://phpc.social/@thgs">@thgs</a>

Hey there, I'm a startup founder in the drug discovery analytics space. I previously worked as a computational biologist doing cancer immunology research. Many difficulties in that experience led me to work on developing a conversational data analytics platform for biologists. I want to learn more about strategies to enable scientists without deep computational expertise be able to interact with big data more intuitively. That includes the design domain specific languages and efficient abstraction strategies of the analytical functionalities/libraries in certain biological domains. I'm located in San Diego if any of you guys are from around here. I'm also <a href="https://voyant.bio/#roles">looking for a cofounder</a> if you know anybody with relevant engineering experience and interests.

Hello from Stockholm, Sweden (although I'm originally American). I'm a software engineer / startup founder and I've worked in both big tech and startups/scale-ups, most recently in IoT and cloud backend, but want to get back to sort of my "roots": as a kid, I read about Englebart/Kay/Macintosh team and I fell in love with the vision of <em>personal</em> computing and the belief in the potential of software as a new medium for human thought and expression.  I was one of the first members of Brad Myers' Natural Programming project at CMU HCII as an undergrad, and I worked at Apple as an engineer on the Mac OS X user experience team during the wondrous Steve Jobs era (I worked on every release from Public Beta to 10.6 Snow Leopard).<br/><br/>I loved HyperCard back in the day and I'm interested in anything along that vein, i.e. end-user programming for the masses. I'm also interested in the problem of funding and commercializing work in this space of "future of coding". I want to see more innovation make its way to the real world, not just remain interesting research projects that languish. Currently I'm participating in a global startup incubator program (Antler.co) and open to starting something new.

i used to work as a programmer, a bit in games, a bit in weby stuff and mobile apps, a bit in desktop. my go-to line, to explain why i no longer work as a programmer, is to say i love programming too much to turn it into a job.<br/><br/>damn, and i've never used slack. <br/><br/>anyway, i've always been interested in programming languages (broadly construed.) currently i'm working on a language for writing a certain kind of interactive fiction, and, in the process learning to write DSLs in racket. i wish it was easier! <br/><br/>thank you, carry on... and i'll find how to enter line-breaks in this thing.

I am very fond of continuous exploration of the computing and programming space, and I have a wide range of interests and skills: anywhere from MUMPS to Lisp, C to Rust, Prolog to SQL, you name it. I am also very interested in popularizing the lesser-known but great concepts that lead to better software (when I have the energy and inspiration for that!) – I’ve been at it professional over 20 years (and a bit more if I can count my earlier days.<br/><br/>I am based out of beautiful Vancouver Island in Canada and love the outdoors, [marathon] running, and a few other things.

Howdy from Austin, TX, USA.<br/><br/>My name's Chris, and I'm a software engineer at a SaaS company with a little background in graphic design and product design. As such, my coding experience is mostly front-end, UI stuff; and I'm really interested in usability, shortening feedback loops for users and developers, and what makes the real world so much more satisfying than the current digital landscape.<br/><br/>My love of programming started with trying to make games in Basic, but I haven't developed in that area since age 12.<br/><br/>My guiding principle is making the whole world customizable and mutable for everyone. Then reality would be a more accurate reflection of what people love instead of what they're stuck with. That encompasses arts, crafts, politics, and all creative disciplines - including programming.

As my company sells mostly “developer time”, I have the feeling that my business model is reaching it’s end and I try to prepare my company for the transition.<br/><br/>Last year I created a “Feature of Software” team at our company that I manage directly and we work on creating tools and processes that leverage AI in all steps of software creation: product management, project management, design, coding. We are working mainly on:<br/>• training people on existing tools (GPTs, Copilot and such)<br/>• creating our own tools: custom GPTs to remplace / improve on different steps in the process, code generation tools<br/>• spreading the word about AI and it’s impact<br/>I live in Paris, happy to connect on line or in the physical world.

So, a quick introduction.<br/><br/>My name’s Chris, a Kiwi living on the Norfolk coast (UK). I’m a web/systems architect who’s been building things online since ’98, mostly as a solo/self-contained do-everything - was LAMP, now working in Node/React/Next + a little Python/Tensorflow.<br/><br/>Two years ago, I jumped into corporate life for some stability/security, designing/building a chatbot management platform for a large financial company – structured conversations, rather than GenAi (firmly of the belief that LLMs are not – and may never be – capable of truth).<br/><br/>Outside of the paid stuff, I’m working on a music streaming system that dynamically selects songs by analysing and blending the key/intensity/harmonics when one track ends and the next begins. It’s a not-for-profit, zero user-tracking, not-looking-for-funding project. You can <a href="https://midtempo.net/">listen here</a>.<br/><br/>Away from a screen, I keep bees and spend time in our pottery studio - where I’m still (and will forever be) learning to throw.

Hey everyone! I’m a Software Engineer and the founder of a startup called Midicircuit - a music education app that helps you get started making music. I used to be a rapper, I make beats and play the bass guitar.<br/><br/>I am originally from Lisbon, Portugal :smile: but have been living in London for 10y now and working with all kinds of startups as a perm and eventually as a contractor while bootstrapping my own ideas.<br/><br/>I have passions in tech, design, photograpy and in the past few years baking (lol, I have been “mastering” the art of the sourdough).<br/><br/>I joined this slack because in the space of a couple weeks “the future of code” has popped in my life at a party, some meetup recommendation and twitter. So I am really curious but also I am here to learn something new, to meet awesome people, maybe grab a coffee with them, build cool things together, to be serendiputous.<br/><br/>Thank you and,<br/><br/>Slack ya later :v::skin-tone-5:

I can't remember how I found FoC, but the sheer depth of nerdery in the podcast got me hooked. I'm only a few episodes in, but thought I'd hop in here to see what the community is like.

:wave: Hi! I'm a designer/coder in London, UK.<br/><br/>:sun_with_face: By day I do product design for a no-code e-commerce analytics startup, which lets people build complex reports without SQL.<br/><br/>:waxing_crescent_moon: By night I lament the gulf between visual design (e.g. in Figma) and the real implementation in code, and am curious about ways to bridge these worlds and remove duplicated effort. I'm interested if anyone here is exploring that. :eyes:

Hey, all! I'm Declan, I develop calculang, a language for calculations (<a href="http://calculang.dev">calculang.dev</a> @calculang on twitter/fosstodon). I've been lurking in the group for some weeks now and look forward to sharing a new gallery/playground and other bits about calculang soon and hearing your feedback!<br/>calculang is about a bunch of things, but fundamentally about separating numbers from programming so they can be visualized, followed, communicated and things that are relatively hard when mixed with general programming.<br/>By itself it fits in the FP space too: everything is a pure function, and "input inference" is intended to make the functions (or 'formulas') flexible by removing the tedious threading of arguments. This is the only really technical thing and it's &lt;100 LOC and something I found really interesting to play with.<br/>Since I only care about pure numbers calculang should integrate with other programming languages to 'do things': mainly Javascript now (calculang transpiles into JS). + I'm beginning to do some things with Python maybe Julia.<br/>My examples focus a lot on visualization and interactivity with numbers/their models, which JS is well primed for, but needs to generalize better also like spreadsheets do.<br/>I look forward to sharing progress and to learning from the community! :grinning:

Hello all computing futurists! I'm a fellow future of coding enthusiast. I believe that with some effort computing could be made more ergonomic, more egalitarian and more efficient. I've tried and failed to start my own visual programming startup, done a PhD in language modelling (in the pre-transformer era) and worked on cybersecurity at Google for 8 years. Now I'm back to visual programming. This time as a hobby project :)<br/><br/>I have a tiny YouTube channel where I live-stream my work: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcTosjkFZZY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcTosjkFZZY</a>.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to exchanging feedback and ideas with other like-minded people. I particularly like in-person meetings, quiet natural environments and morning hours (anyone up for a dog walk in the Łódź area?) but I'm also fine with commuting to an evening pub meeting in Berlin or London if that's where other FoC enthusiasts hang out.

Hi! I'm Daniel, based in Germany. I went from Lisp to Haskell enthusiast, then got inspired by Bret Victor to try to build a functional (incremental) visual live programming system. (Did I check all buzzwords? :smile:) Considered this a failure after some years and went a little bit into freelancing. Now I'm cautiously dipping my feet again in the Future of Programming. I'm amazed at what's happened in the last years and am curious to find out what has evolved!

Hello Everyone, I am Sujay from Mumbai, India. I am relatively new to programming world and I usually work with python, C++ although I have also learnt Rust, Solidity and other stuff. I am more inclined towards the emerging technologies and want to contribute to it. Apart from programming I like to read and write or participate in Kaggle competitions. I am currently working as a Software Developer intern at a startup and looking for new opportunities. I am very excited to get to know everyone and maybe huddle sometime.

Hello, World<br/>I'm an independent researcher based in Sweden/Czechia/Germany. I've been spending the last six years researching how to make better text editors (both plain text and rich text), GUIs, GUI frameworks, portable assembly, web browsers and visual programming. I don't publish much, because this is a rabbit hole where making a <em>better something</em> depends on making a <em>better something else</em>, and most things are broken most of the time because of working an a dependency, which then depends on another dependency, but sometimes I go out and speak at events.<br/><br/>The latest addition to my suite of technologies is an unconventional programming language that unifies all my previous technologies. It's a general purpose language and multimedia authoring language unified, that can be used to describe apps, network services, documents, slideshows, websites, pictures and videos in an amount of code that is close to the theoretical minimum, and from that generates code that has an efficiency close to the theoretical maximum. It uses pointers for efficiency and propositional logic for correctness, including complete memory safety. This language proves that in traditional computing there is no tradeoff between efficiency, robustness and ease of use. The same programming language is going to be used for writing high-performance algorithms as for teaching children programming.<br/><br/>Doing research in the future of coding gets lonely. Even among people who work with programming, there are few who understand what I'm doing. I met someone at Jetbrains who showed a good understanding of what I'm doing. He took a look at my visual code editor and recommended me Future of Coding. I've been delaying posting anything here for a year, as I've been feeling overwhelmed with things to do even before starting to involve other people, but now I feel the time is right. I'm writing here in hope to connect with interesting people. Feel free to ask me anything about my research or even get to know me on a personal level. I have have a lot to tell.

Hello! I'm Dev, based on the East Coast in the US. I used to be on here a lot but it's been a while. I'm interested in rethinking the development experience from first principles, touching everything from languages, browsers, shells, and operating systems with code generation, ai, knowledge management, and end user programming. Think unison language, <a href="http://rewind.ai">rewind.ai</a>, val.town, fig, raycast, wasm, etc. - looking forward to catching up on what you all have been up to!

Hi there, I'm Ezhik. I'm a software developer in Tokyo doing the usual stuff (Python/TypeScript/a little Rust).<br/><br/>I came across this place after binging through the SandPond Saga, which really reminded me of how much I miss creative coding and of how much I enjoy sand and computers (which are just thinking sand).<br/><br/>I really want to do more HCI stuff (particularly end-user programming and local-first software), so I've been messing around with breaking into it by looking at old Mac OS X development tutorials, reading up on research by groups like Ink &amp; Switch, and making silly little prototypes.<br/><br/>You can find me on Mastodon at <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Ezhik">https://mastodon.social/@Ezhik</a> if you want to chat more. As a welcome offering please accept this cellular automata demo I made a few years back: <a href="https://ezhik.me/beyond184/">https://ezhik.me/beyond184/</a><br/><br/>P.S. <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Rafał Pastuszak</span> that is a wonderful hedgehog.

Hi everyone, I'm Doug, sort of a coding jack of all trades. <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ben Byford</span> just invited me, guess we'll see whether he regrets this :wink:<br/>I really do all sorts of things (see <a href="https://dougthompson.co.uk">here</a> and <a href="https://starriver.run">here</a>) but the reason I joined was to get some opinions, from people far more intelligent than me, on an idea I've been slowly piecing together for a while now.<br/>It's about OS design, where IMO <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/26/starting_over_rebooting_the_os/">the air is becoming restless</a>. Still getting the ideas into a format appropriate for Slack - I'll chuck it into #share-your-work and either (a) we'll all have a good laugh at it or (b) it'll be viable and I'll be shocked.<br/>Cheers! :wave:

I'm a designer turned founder (<a href="http://progression.co">progression.co</a> for the last 5 years), recently moved to Manchester but wanting to keep in touch with the London scene. Nice to meet y'all!

Hello All <br/> I’ve found my way here curtesy of <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Pokey Rule</span> who allowed me to take over a Sunday discussion (meant to cover Cursorless-TalonVoice). I’m convinced that there is a sweet spot for programming computers to be made more efficient and humane through voice and 3D representation of code. My current thoughts are that leveraging existing spoken wrappers around the array programming language “Uiua.” Are a good starting point to make computers more humane and make programming more accessible for people. More to see here probably only temporarily though <a href="https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/discussions/2059">https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/discussions/2059</a>

Hey everyone! My name is Ignacio Brasca; I’m from Argentina but currently based in Stockholm. I’m passionate about systems of all kinds, and I don’t think there’s too much to say about me other than that I found interesting multiple stuff from photography up to linguistics.<br/><br/>Currently, my day-to-day job is to be CTO at a Series A fintech company, but that’s too boring to be shared :lolsob:<br/><br/>Happy to be here and good to see a community like this alive

Hi all! My name is Boris Terzic, I'm a programmer originally from Belgium, now working and living in Germany. I discovered Future of Coding through the podcast (my new favorite) and after listening to a bunch of episodes got increasingly curious about what's going on here.<br/><br/>By day I am the head of development of a smaller Germany software company building a web based GIS and BI application.<br/><br/>In my free time I am very interested in offline-first datastructures and models like CRDTs and in general building web-native sites and applications. Deep down I think I may also want to be a graphics programmer, but I have almost no experience with it aside from some demo scene noodling when I was younger.<br/><br/>Happy to be here and looking forward to read and share interesting thoughts!

Hi folks! <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Krycho</span>’s message above reminds me that I've actually just been a lurker here for the past several weeks and haven't actually introduced myself yet! Lol<br/><br/>I'm an Ex-Googler/Ex-Amazonian that left work this past February to spend a year full time committing to my passion project, the <a href="http://clarolang.com">Claro programming language</a>! I'm ~3 years into development on the language, and in 2023 things have really accelerated and the language is at a place I'm very proud of (although it still is lacking in the way of documentation). If you're interested in checking out an early stage language with some very novel ideas about <a href="https://jasonsteving99.github.io/claro-lang/graph_procedures/graph_procedures.html">provably safe/efficient concurrency</a> and a powerful <a href="https://jasonsteving99.github.io/claro-lang/module_system.html">module system</a> and a sprinkling of <a href="https://github.com/JasonSteving99/claro-lang/tree/main/stdlib/utils/abstract_modules/example">compile-time "meta-programming" magic</a>, take a look!<br/><br/>I'll be working through Advent of Code in Claro this year, so if you'd like a taste of what that looks like: I'll be dumping my solutions <a href="https://github.com/JasonSteving99/claro-lang/tree/main/examples/claro_programs/advent_of_code_2023/">here</a>.

Hello! I’m a software engineer with a focus on ethics, type systems, frameworks, and UI. Most recently I was the tech lead for LinkedIn’s main web app (the .com! But the emails were not my fault). Before that, in reverse chronological order, I: rebuilt the front end for a profitable unicorn no one has ever heard of (Olo), built a Bible web app, did a bunch of random web consulting, built hazards/risk mitigation software with physics models for a tiny company in the energy industry, and wrote avionics software that is, to my knowledge, still flying (though honestly I hope someone has rewritten it :joy:).<br/><br/>I am currently taking a sabbatical through the end of the year, filling in some of the holes in my CS knowledge (~a minor in music composition, a major in physics, and a Master of Divinity; more or less zero formal CS education) and writing orchestra music.<br/><br/>I have been focused specifically on programming languages and frameworks over the past few years—I was <em>the</em> Rust podcaster 2015–2019, and have done more work with TypeScript than anyone ever should (primarily in the Ember.js world).<br/><br/>All of that already had me <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/next/role/">thinking about “ratchets” over “levers” for the prac&hellip;</a>. (That post is notionally about the job hunt I’m going to start properly at the end of this sabbatical on January 1, but all but the last paragraph or so is more like a statement of what I am thinking in this space!) <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jason Steving</span> mentioned this group to me today and I had to pop in as soon as I could. Looking forward to learning from what you folks are up to!

Hello, I have a degree in Computer Science, and I live in Romania, EU.<br/><br/>I do mostly research & development and occasionally I take on commercial projects for revenue.<br/>My focus is web design & front-end development. Yes, I'm a self-taught designer with works featured in online galleries.<br/><br/>My current research is provably correct, likely correct software + rapid iterations. My previous research was on design systems.<br/><br/>I'm reading the FoC newsletter since ~2021 -- and now it became the most important source of inspiration. I'm waiting every Monday morning !!<br/>It's the first time I'm having something to add, so I'm joining the community.<br/><br/>Thank you for all, and keep up! :slightly_smiling_face:

Ahoy! I'm Josh, a software engineer in Marin (the sleepy, boring part of the Bay Area).<br/><br/>I've worked on a variety of things over my 15ish years, including computer vision and (very early) deep learning, the Go compiler and standard library, and secure networking. One of the few threads running through my career is an abiding interest in how developers work and in building things for developers.<br/><br/>I'm particularly interested in faster feedback loops, better input mechanisms, power tools, version control, and (recently) how this little AI kerfuffle will play out past co-pilots. I really like weird and experimental stuff, and don't get enough of it in my current life.<br/><br/>I'm here courtesy of <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Pokey Rule</span>; his description of the demos at a recent London meetup sounded like just my cup of tea. I'm at a career crossroads, so I'm also secretly hoping for a bit of serendipity or inspiration :shushing_face:.

Hi! I'm Zak, a software engineer living in Cary, NC, USA. I've been programming professionally for about 8 years and have been interested in better/new ways of doing things for most of that time. I saw a link to <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/061">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/061</a> on hacker news and found it really interesting/rewarding, and after looking through the main site this seems like a place where lots of people are interested in the same kinds of things as me! I have a running doc of things that kind of suck or interesting ideas I come across that involve computing (e.g. Xanadu, Gwern's practice of taking a snapshot of everything he links to, undo at the operating system level, Nix, to name a few) and I'm hoping to have some interesting conversations here!

Hi all! I’m Mike Stringer from Chicago. When I have to introduce myself in a big channel like this I end up thinking <em>who... am... I?</em> Professionally my background is in physics, I started a data science consulting company, led the AI+Design practice at IDEO, shifted gears completely into "people ops / HR" (I like people even more than coding), and am currently in dabble/explore mode. A few books I think are related to the future of coding: <a href="https://worldcat.org/en/title/43718211">Information Ecologies</a>, <a href="https://worldcat.org/en/title/28504839">Mindstorms</a>, and <a href="https://worldcat.org/en/title/213300656">How To Talk About Books You Haven't Read</a>.<br/><br/>I was excited to read about this community,  and I'm looking forward to learning and sharing!

My name is Brandel (<tt>@zachernuk</tt> on most social media), and I work on "Immersive web standards," the practical implications for information, and the encoding of meaning when physical constraints go away. I've been playing with the web for over 25 years and have left a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxviGskApcw">few</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeKdDatIItU">fun</a> <a href="https://codepen.io/zachernuk/full/WNGOgmE">experiments</a> in my wake.

Salut, my name is Dany. My background is in visual effects and animation. About 10 years ago I decided to do a sabbatical and work on a game. Frustrated with the state of the tools I started creating my own programming system. It's called miqula, it's not yet in a presentable form, you can have a peek at: <a href="http://www.miqula.com">www.miqula.com</a>, the site is dated though. I hope to show a bit more soon and exchange some ideas, albeit some of the content here seems over my head. :slightly_smiling_face:

Hi all! I'm Joni. I'm a designer/founder/front-end guy from Turku, Finland. Been diving deep into generative AI lately, and we built a little side project to help with our gen AI explorations: <a href="http://kollaprompt.com">kollaprompt.com</a>. Been doing design and front-end since ~2004 and it's been while since I was this excited about new tech, especially defining the new use cases, UX/UI paradigms and best practises around gen AI.<br/><br/>Aside from work I run a Cyberpunk RED TTRPG campaign and been exploring an AI assistant there to help our group with rules &amp; lore with a locally running setup (I'll post a demo when I'm happy with how it works).<br/><br/>Found this group via awesome demos from meet-ups that float in social media and looking forward to attending an event in the near future.

Hello, I'm Robert I'm based in Minneapolis, I have been working for a home iot company for the last few years primarily because I get to write Rust professionally.

The last month or so I have been trying to teach myself to build a compiler front-end using the Lua programming language as a source

Hi, I'm Mike, living on the southern edge of South Africa, out in the sticks, on a dodgy dirt track that hangs off the furthest reaches of the Internet Highway (remember that?) The electrons get to drive <b>very</b> slowly here.<br/><br/>I've been a developer (largely in the OO world) since the mid-1980s, now mostly-retired and doing some part-time work for [a non-profit](<a href="https://wethinkcode.co.za">https://wethinkcode.co.za</a>) that teaches development (so: more than mere programming!) to youngsters who would not ordinarily be able to get access to such. I work on curriculum things.<br/><br/>My interest in better software tooling is a natural consequence of my larger concern with Personal Computing (<a href="https://one.mikro2nd.net/pages/personal-computing/">https://one.mikro2nd.net/pages/personal-computing/</a>). I want to see our personal computation tooling serve us better as individuals, to help us think better, individually and in groups. That means I want the means of personal computation to be wrested (back) out of the grasp of the walled-garden overlords who want to use computers as Dystopian Television. Making such tools demands (much!) better software tooling, imho, and consequently I'm curious about what everybody here is up to.<br/><br/>Some of my thinking and writing about this is in my own web garden (<a href="https://one.mikro2nd.net/">https://one.mikro2nd.net/</a>) if you're interested.<br/><br/>edit: Erk! Didn't realise that those links would show up so obnoxiously in Slack. My apologies - I'll try and make them plain text instead. (Nope. That didn't work :() Is there a way to turn that preview nonsense off?

I'll introduce myself - I'm Mike from the Bay Area, California, and I love design and love to code (day job is UX Eng). My bumper sticker would say "I'd rather be coding". If I didn't code, I would likely would have become an industrial designer. A "little" project I've been working on is a React (as in UI framework) Desktop and programming language. Only recently have I tied the Desktop and the language together, which in hindsight I also should have done a long time ago :slightly_smiling_face: <a href="https://mike-austin.com/react-desktop">https://mike-austin.com/react-desktop</a><br/><br/>In "Files", if you go into Scripts, you can run a few demos like Particle System.kopi or read some of the Kopi Markdown files. Both the desktop and language have been through several versions over several years, and are designed by "what should I do next / what feels missing?" mentality. Enjoy!

Hi all! I’m Amy Ko, Professor at the University of Washington Information School. I think a lot about programming, culture, and identity, and also occasionally try to invent weird new programming languages and tools. I’ll be releasing one at the end of the month.

Hi! I'm George Svarovsky. For most of my career I've been engineering software for the scientific research domain, which has some interesting characteristics on the 'veracity' and 'variety' axes of big data management. So my primary interests lie broadly in the domains of software correctness and knowledge management.<br/><br/>My <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.5095.4400">MSc dissertation</a> was an experiment in taking some of the successful ideas found in software unit testing tooling to formal modelling, to try and encourage modelling as a first-class citizen in software repositories, verifiably tied to source code and tests. (I still think the idea has legs!)<br/><br/>I've always been a fan of the Semantic Web and the Resource Description Framework (RDF), ever since it popped up at the time I was trying to invent a graph-based metamodel for life sciences data. But while I enjoy its associated global-graph dreams and ontology navel-gazing as much as anyone, what I find compelling is actually the commitment to having a metamodel for data at all. I have distilled the problem I see here into a PhD <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wSauHwsUdyqnxEHMtc6xg-_3b00xovNYDnmFATG0zD8/edit?usp=sharing">research statement</a>.<br/><br/>After working on a personal project in the space of software architecture tooling, which needed multiplayer editing, I became interested in master-master data synchronisation and recent advances like Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). I've been in that space for a few years now as an independent researcher, supported by grants from the EU, working on a component that marries some of these ideas with the RDF (<a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2941/paper1.pdf">short paper</a>). It's intended to be a modest but useful tool for sharing live information, but it embodies some bigger ideas about the relationship between application code and the data it operates on, which I initially wrote about  in <a href="https://codeburst.io/the-data-%C3%A6ther-da22d28bc938">The Data Æther</a>.<br/>I'm hoping to write more, and I look forward to bouncing ideas around here!

Hey :wave::skin-tone-2:<br/><br/>I met a bunch of folks from this community a couple of weeks ago as we took a scenic and circuitous route to the Strange Loop conference via train from Seattle to St Louis. (See photo)<br/><br/>My claim to fame is I'm the co-lead of the <a href="https://github.com/cucumber">https://github.com/cucumber</a> open source project, it's a tool for running executable acceptance tests that can be read and written in plan language. I also wrote <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/hwcuc2/the-cucumber-book-second-edition/">a book</a> about it, many moons ago. I've been involved with it for 15 years now! AMA about trying to fund open source projects and make them sustainable. I have no answers but I've tried plenty of things that didn't work!<br/><br/>I've always been one of those people who can talk to humans as well as computers, so I often end up being the translator in the social system in and around a programming team. That's what got me interested in Cucumber and BDD in the first place, but it's also what attracts me to this podcast and the community here.<br/><br/>I'm English originally but these days I live in a little mountain town called Nelson in the unceded territory of the Ktunaxa Nation, Sinixt Nation, and Syilx Peoples, more commonly known as south-eastern British Columbia.

Hey all, I'm Jasmine. I'm at UCSC Computational Media finishing up a thesis with Adam Smith on explorables-style bespoke creativity support tools, and how different kinds of experts use these tools in practice. I learned of this community a few years ago through Strange Loop.<br/><br/>I've been working for the past couple of years with aerospace operations experts and their scheduling practices, and with narrative designers to build static analysis tools for storylet-based games. In practice I've been building a lot of exploratory notebooks with different forms of direct manipulation, depending on the underlying domain-specific query logic. Very excited to talk about the future of software instruments and how they're made.

Hi all! I'm Grey from San Diego, CA. I stumbled upon the community after getting into digital gardens and reading lots of Maggie Appleton's articles. Ironically, we've been doing a version of #linking-together at my day job for the last couple of years, so it's great to see so many people posting about all these topics.<br/>I've been interested in technology and art for a long time. I did well with programming in high school but didn't take it up as a profession until college. I started with graphic design, then moved into web design, front end, backend, and devops. I enjoy building with others, and love to see how people are continuing to use programming/the Internet as a creative medium. Other interests: cooking, reading, and writing content that past me would have found helpful :technologist:

Hi everyone, I'm Jen. I'm originally from Puerto Rico, but currently based in Atlanta, Georgia. I started my career in software after teaching myself Javascript to help with repetitive tasks at my animation studio job. I think I was able to pick it up quickly because a decade before that, Geocities, MySpace, and Neopets had taught me to not be afraid of code-looking-things. I feel like there aren't many spaces like that anymore, so programmers are treated like wizards rather than fellow craftspeople. I would love to help create something that could facilitate art-making and leave the busywork to computers.

Hello I'm Alex, and am interested in live coding music and heritage algorithms. I'm a non-academic research fellow at a small non-profit Then Try This, with a project exploring "algorithmic patterns" in a range of collaborations. I'm currently interested in fringe possibilities of hand drawn programming environments, and also how continuous and discrete patterns can be represented and combined together. I've been here before but struggle a bit with slack and tech culture, lets see if I can last this time :slightly_smiling_face:

Hi everyone, I'm Chris. No fancy bio, just a Rwandan software developer currently based in South Africa, disenchanted with the present dominant forms of computing and seeking solace and inspiration in the forgotten ideas from the history of this young field and the brave ideas for a different future, with an eye towards application in the developing world.<br/><br/>I found an abundance of both kinds of ideas in the podcast and newsletter, which is how I ended up here. I'm grateful that this community exists and looking forward to contributing somehow :)

Hi everyone, I’m Alex, and I like thinking and prototyping design and academic research tools. Super stoked to be part of this community!<br/><br/>I’m a quant trader by day, but I really enjoy prototyping research tools after work and during the weekends (particularly in academic research). The design space for computing is so rich, I’m always dumbfounded and excited by all the possibilities. I find a lot of inspiration from the typical suspects: Alan Kay, Bret Victor, Maggie Appleton, Douglas Engelbart, etc.<br/><br/>I write down some of my thoughts on <a href="https://www.hajeon.xyz/">my blog</a> from time-to-time. If anyone is in Chicago, I’d love to chat and/or meetup :slightly_smiling_face: Nice to meet you all!

I should've joined long ago! Here's some history of my interest in the space: I found out about the FoC podcast at a coding club in Waterloo in 2019. I remember Ravi Chugh's Sketch-n-Sketch really caught my attention back then. Way before that, I think when I was getting more into hobby web development, coming from hobby game development, I watched Bret Victor's "Inventing on Principle" which inspired me. I love learning about people's FoC projects and visions. Many of you in this slack have really inspired me!<br/><br/>I'm currently doing some contracting, working on Polytope, learning some math, and figuring out what to do next in my career.

Hi everyone designing the future of coding! I'm Stan, a developer by day and a calligrapher/design-geek by night. (Had my 15 mins of Instagram fame doing calligraphy on the beach! <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wanderingstan">https://www.instagram.com/wanderingstan</a> )<br/><br/>It's bugged me that the <em><b>visual design of code</b></em> has stagnated in the 20+ years since the advent of syntax highlighting. (Modulo the arguments over coding ligatures!) <em>What would it look like to prioritize visual design in editors and in new languages?</em> And can this be done while maintaining essential properties of code?<br/><br/>I'm working on some blog posts/manifestos/essays on the subject (super-rough-draft attached), and a live prototype. Would love to connect with those building editors or languages for whom this idea resonates, and with designers who see code as a unique but powerful design challenge.<br/><br/>Short bio: Was founder of a couple startups (<a href="http://sovrn.com">sovrn.com</a>, <a href="http://wordnik.com">wordnik.com</a>), early employee at many more. Most recently design prototyper in Meta AR Research. Thanks to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Gabriel Pickard</span> for pointing me to this group!

Hi everyone, I am Eugene and I am super excited to join this community (referred by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span>). I am a designer-turn-engineer and have been design tools in the app building space, most recently at Palantir.<br/><br/>I've recently switched into research mode, thinking about how GenAI can help people, especially non-techies, build their own tools. I am writing and building prototypes around this idea and posting all these things here: <a href="https://blog.eugenechantk.me/?tag=appbuilding">https://blog.eugenechantk.me/?tag=appbuilding</a><br/><br/>I am just in awe that there is a community out here that is thinking and working on what I am passionate about. Love to chat or meet up if anyone is in SF

Hi folks, I’m prabhanshu from Bangalore. I’ve been researching spreadsheets and how they enable end user programming for some time now. I came across this Slack from <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Maggie Appleton</span>’s work. I’ve found a lot of useful ideas here. Much thanks to everyone who’s put this community together.<br/><br/>I’ve recently started building a “spreadsheet playground” with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ravi Chandra Padmala</span> where we’re thinking about the spreadsheet medium from the ground up. The idea is to acknowledge and improve spreadsheets as an environment for building small information systems. We’re looking at patterns from the programming/software-building world we can apply to simplify them a bit and make it easy to make reliable and maintainable spreadsheets.<br/><br/>My background is in software building and we want to work with folks who have experience in HCI/PL/notation design. I’d love to talk if any of it sounds interesting :)

hi i'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-price1/">rachel</a>! i'm not a software engineer but i've worked closely with developers for the past 8+ years and i've always wanted to build my own app... now, with generative AI, i've been able to start an iOS app from scratch without much coding experience.. it isn't perfect and an iOS engineer would do a much better job, but I am finding it really exciting what AI can do in terms of lowering technical barriers and getting non engineers involved in code. specifically interested in LLMs / tools / techniques that can help you build products and generate working code. reach out if you have any tips or suggestions!

Hello! I stumbled across the podcast recently and have been working my way through the back catalog -- been totally blown away, tons of material I've never scratched the surface of. I studied music tech in school, so have spent a lot of time getting jaded about the Max/MSP workflow, and was very excited to see the discussion of broader approaches to graphical programming because I kind of wrote the whole thing off for a while there. I'm big on NixOS and functional programming and other stuff. Also was excited to see the Alberta representation, I'm in Edmonton!

Hi Future of Coding folk! I am Sam.<br/><br/>I realized I had never introduced myself here even though I have been around for a while.<br/><br/>I am a Software Engineer from Brazil. I have been into programming for the past 10 years. All this time I felt there was something suboptimal with the way we program today, both for fun and for work. That’s what motivated to start the unit project <a href="https://unit.md">https://unit.md</a>.<br/><br/>My initial approach for creating a new visual language was to go reference-less, so I would have to implement it from scratch, based mostly on intuition. I also wanted unit to feel like an “alien tool”, untied from the current state of the art aesthetics and user experience.<br/><br/>I felt we had all these cool Computer Science, Systems Programming and Design concepts, but no readily accessible fully visual system attempting to incorporate them all. My take was that this was a fundamentally a Software Engineering problem; it would likely take years for one to develop something like that.<br/><br/>One day a friend saw the prototype and mentioned Victor Bret. Later I was touched watching “Inventing on Principle”. That was my entrance to this rabbit hole; you know the rest. I can simply hear Allan Kay say something like “Recursive Design” and that is it. That is enough for me to start pursuing an year long new system feature.<br/><br/>I usually come here looking for some inspiration. Maybe some Programming Language concept I haven’t heard of, a fancy Structured Editing demo or some curated paper. It is impossible to compress all the cool stuff!<br/><br/>Finally, I am very thankful for the existence of this community! Good job everyone!

Hello all, greetings from Quadra Island, BC. I've been listening to the podcast for a little while now, and slowly working my way backward from what's current. Professional life started with mostly Unix-like systems, plenty of server-side web tech, from CGI onwards. I've morphed into infosec consulting of various flavours for the last 16 or so years, but still messing about with software where it helps me scratch some itch. Lisps and functional languages are recurring themes.<br/>Outside of work, there's walking our dogs on the shores of paradise, and volunteer work as a firefighter. Who needs sleep?

Hi folks, I'm <a href="https://gfor.rest">Grant</a>. longtime (podcast) listener checking in from Raleigh, NC. Still taking the temperature on this community but I'd probably position my work on the practical side of things; I'm interested in new ideas insofar as they help me make the end products I dream about making, and more easily.<br/><br/>To that end I've been building out <a href="https://verdant.dev">my own local-first/crdt/multiplayer framework for the web</a> for the sake of building the <a href="https://gnocchi.club">grocery list of my dreams</a> and I've been having a lot of fun with that.<br/><br/>I'm in a bit of a lull at the moment and busy with a new kid, but I'm interested to see if there's any local connections in Raleigh in this community. I get fomo from all those cool London demo meetups.

Hello everybody, I am Máté from Hungary. I am currently between jobs, but I worked as a game developer before, mainly on gameplay and UI areas.<br/><br/>Since I finished university around 6 years ago I am interested in exploring all the facets of software development and interested in moving the discipline forward. My personal project is working on tooling that can visualize existing text-based code in visual format, and I am generally interested in code visualization and software comprehension. I am also fond of topics related to software architecture, design, domain languages and programming language design. Other than that in my jobs I  worked with various desktop and js/web based UI frameworks, proprietary game engines, databases, small scale webservers, and I helped in writing a package manager for a company, and a codebase migration tool. For non-programming related topics I love learning about psychology, philosophy, history, and I love comics :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>I just found this community, and I am really excited to discuss these topics with others who are also interested in them. I would love to find a job where I can work on these or at least contribute to them in my free time.

Hi all! I'm based in Melbourne and am about a year into being 'proper' software developer and occasional designer. I currently work on an application for making timelines.<br/><br/>Before that, I was an academic developing/teaching CAD tools for landscape architects, where I spent a lot of time in a visual programming environment (Grasshopper) and also explored some tangible-table style tools for landform design/simulation. My doctorate was exploring how to design CAD tools that could model natural systems by privileging change-over-time, rather than geometry, as the means of composing design ideas.<br/><br/>I originally came to the FoC podcast when I was slightly obsessed with Orca, although I've mostly shifted over to Teletype for live-coding music. I enjoy the show's recent focus on key comp sci papers and love its approach to audio editing!

Hi folks, I'm Dave. I develop software in Berlin. I was introduced to FoC by Jack Rusher circa the time we worked together on a Clojure notebook project. I'm curious about many aspects of FoC, especially the minutiae of software development workflows, such as patterns to support live coding. I also love to consider the future of our craft by better understanding its past.

Hi folks, quick intro here. I am a Boston-based software developer just trying to get better at this humbling profession. Can’t recall when or how I stumbled across FoC, but the earlier podcasts with Hillel Wayne (TLA+) and Toby Schachman (Cuttle, Apparatus) stick out in my mind. Enjoying the reboot and can’t wait to “dive in” to the next episode. Long time goal to learn Prolog here.

Hello! I’m Mohit, a software engineer in Berlin, Germany. I was introduced to the Future of Coding community through <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Maggie Appleton</span>’s amazing essays while browsing the Internet and reading about <em>digital gardens</em> on Twitter. I was so excited to finally put words to something I enjoyed working with for a long time since I was in tech! Absolutely love the FoC podcast and the takes on various papers. I have previously <a href="https://mohitkarekar.com/posts/2021/unipipe-executor/">tinkered with visual programming</a> and I go back to the project frequently to add features or draw some learnings from it.<br/>My work is majorly in JS/TS and I work in a web platform team; I have always enjoyed working on meta products that let other people build on top of them (and hence my interest in language tools and this community). I also am inclined to use such models to make programming more accessible (esp. in remote parts of my home country (India)) and I like reading any research on these lines. In fact, the podcast has made me more interested in <a href="https://aboutcomputingsystems.substack.com/p/about-computing-systems-a-newsletter">reading research</a> and knowing more about computing history, and through it how it will look in the future.<br/>Looking forward to engaging with the community and attending any events that happen in/around Berlin. Would love to meet some of you!

Hi! I'm an interaction designer/creative tech/specialized generalist/educator/artist (depending on who you ask and when). I initially got into writing code as a means for creating interactive art. Later, while trying to do tangible &amp; embodied interface research, I realised that our research artefacts were so bad and janky that I had no confidence in any of the results. So I learned to build better ones, which included a lot of programming. This made me pretty popular as a prototyper in our group of labs, so I got a lot of practice. Later (again) I learned more code for interactive art (again), and most recently I've been building sensors/equipment, analysis tools &amp; interfaces, and prototypes for environmental monitoring (emission location and quantification). I learned on java and now mostly use c++ and javascript/typescript. Sometimes python if I really have to.<br/><br/>I stumbled across this community on <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span>'s LinkedIn profile haha and am glad to have found it! I'm only surprised I didn't join sooner.<br/><br/>Regarding computer futurism - I've been dancing around the ideas of embodied interaction, tangible interfaces, and sensor-network-interfaces / distributed systems for a number of years. My experience in these fields mostly lies around fun and education. For example, using tangible interfaces to effectively increase cognitive bandwidth for learning by avoiding overloading the already saturated cognitive pathway occupied by sight and sound (touch uses different pathways). Or exploring how we might use (or recognize and avoid) embodied metaphors in computational systems as a tool of influence in persuasive gaming. Or how we might help others to understand and empathize with other cultures through embodied values and tangible artefacts.<br/><br/>In the very near future I'm working on some fun things with blinky lights and simple interactions to be fun and silly and delightful. If anyone in AB/Edmonton is doing that kind of stuff, reach out! Here are some of my projects that might give you an idea of what I do: <a href="https://brendanmatkin.com/">https://brendanmatkin.com/</a>

Hi, I'm Charlie from Cambridge, MA. I'm a programmer turned high school computer science teacher and I'm primarily interested in how kids learn to code. I write on the topic on my blog (some relevant posts <a href="https://blog.charliemeyer.co/code-doesnt-happen-to-you/">here</a> and <a href="https://blog.charliemeyer.co/errors-are-not-failures/">here</a>) and I'm working on a project for a new structured editor for beginners. My hypothesis is that we can get more people excited about programming by making it easier for beginners to make projects they care about.<br/><br/>I would love to chat with anyone in the education/structured editor space and share notes!

I just posted in #two-minute-week so I should probably introduce myself.<br/><br/>I'm a software contractor based in London, with my professional work centering around python, devops, machine learning and SDET.<br/><br/>In my spare time I have written some open source. After getting frustrated with something I later dubbed "the Norway problem" I created a <a href="https://github.com/crdoconnor/strictyaml">YAML parser</a> that ripped out the most frustrating parts of YAML and parsed the core of the language that I actually liked and made it type-safe.<br/><br/>This parser was a fork in the road to my main vision which was:<br/><br/>• A more humane way to do TDD in situations where orthodox unit test driven development makes no sense (like building a new page on a website).<br/>• A more humane way to do BDD that doesn't involve Gherkin.<br/>• A way to <b>actually</b> do "documentation driven development" for real - e.g. to have how-to documentation as a side effect of writing example based specifications.<br/>This is what <a href="https://github.com/hitchdev/hitchstory">hitchstory</a> is for - at least in theory, to make it easy, to make TDD always make sense, to make it fun rather than a chore, and to make 100% test coverage and 100% documentation coverage of your code a side effect of doing that.<br/><br/>If any of that interests you, we should talk.

Hello.  I'm Beni, from Israel.  Work at Red Hat.  Been lurking (podcast, newsletter, link-walking) for ~2 years.<br/>Interested in all the ways in which open source ostensibly <em>allows</em> user modification of software but falls short of making it <a href="https://twitter.com/jonobacon/status/817059475437879305">approachable</a>.  Love esoteric languages [making me a poor judge of what's approachable :laughing:].<br/>Obsessed with Boxer; dream of stealing some ideas from it into a unix window/file manager, but 100% vaporware at this point.

Hi everybody. I just joined the group, and will be at this evening’s meetup.<br/><br/>I’ve been writing software since the 90's, and have been in San Francisco since 2015. In recent years, I have been working primarily with JS/TS at health tech startups.<br/><br/>As a result of WFH + pandemic, I find myself missing community — particularly <em>in-person</em> community — and am excited to meet folks tonight!

Hey everyone, I'm Daniel. I write code for a living, and consider my life's mission to leave the place better than I found it.<br/><br/>I have no memory of how I found Future of Coding, but I think possibly while desperately searching for coding-related podcasts with deep content. While the actual F of C isn't something I'm extremely interested in <em>per se</em>, I have an intellectual/philosophical streak that makes observing these kinds of discussions really enjoyable. I first listened to the Naur episode and found it incredible, and quite illuminating of the <em>Present</em> of Coding.<br/><br/>I was born in Australia and have lived in a few other places around the world, but currently based in Sydney. I consider myself a Quaker with significant Christian influence. My influences at the moment are Jacques Ellul, Christopher Alexander, Ursulas Franklin and Le Guin, Karl Popper via David Deutsch, and Sandi Metz.<br/><br/>Looking forward to lurking and hopefully, when so moved, providing small contributions of some value :)

Hey everyone! I’m <a href="https://kabir.computer">Kabir</a>, an undergrad at UC Berkeley. I started my programming journey with Visual Basic and Replit in middle school, and a recent project employing low-code tools led me down the programming environments rabbit hole once again. :smile:<br/><br/>I’m currently thinking about (1) ways to extend the spreadsheet paradigm to full-stack development, and (2) the design opportunities that LLMs present for interactive computing. I recently experimented with using a restricted set of primitives in a Jupyter-style interface to build simple web apps. (Demo <a href="https://twitter.com/KabirGoel/status/1643868228865916928">here</a>.)<br/><br/>Found Future of Coding while searching <a href="http://metaphor.systems">Metaphor</a> for interesting prior work in the live programming space. (<em>Wow</em>, finding this community feels like a belated birthday gift.) Nice to meet you all!

Hi folks! I ought introduce myself so that I don’t seem like a complete rando at Saturday’s meetup. I moved to London from the US only a few months ago. I’m doing my best to meet people and make friends!<br/><br/>Professionally, I’m am SRE. Personally, I am interested in how computers work, computer and internet history (ask me about my collection of obscure computer books), text entry systems, and AI. By AI I mean that I’m more interested in the end-use of AI, and the societal impacts thereof, than how statistical inference works.<br/><br/>Since moving to London I’ve been taking a break from work to hang out with my son and write a blog. Recently, a <a href="https://www.cyberdemon.org/2023/03/29/age-of-ai-skill-atrophy.html">blog post</a> urging people not to stop learning despite the strength of ChatGPT went very mildly viral.

Hi, Gregory here. Living in the medieval town of Youghal, steeped in the past thinking about the future. Seems like text is making a big comeback. Which is good for me as my current work has been described as a "great leap backwards". It's an attempt to nurture a creative middle class and it all starts with this patent:  <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11455625B2">https://patents.google.com/patent/US11455625B2</a>

Hello, I am a roboticist / applied scientist at <a href="http://theaiinstitute.com">theaiinstitute.com</a> and I'm interested in improving programming systems for robotics. I place a bet that there would be a big payoff if robotics developers invest time in tackling <b>robot software engineering</b> as a problem by using more interactive and semantically introspectable programming systems. It is fun to think about the role that LLMs might play in this.

Hey there, been lurking in the group for a while but haven't properly introduced myself.<br/><br/>I'm working at Fiberplane full time on Developer and Customer Experience (a mix of support, devrel, product role) and maintaining the <a href="https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-ts">Autometrics library</a>. Exploring type systems, interactive programming, and "smol" but helpful utilities on the side.<br/><br/>My recent obsession that I rabbit-holed on since starting to work on Autometrics is (ab)using TypeScript plugin API for fun and profit.<br/><br/>You can find me on <a href="https://laurynas.cc">https://laurynas.cc</a> (not much there yet but at least it links off to my Mastodon) :wave:

I just posted in #share-your-work so I should probably introduce myself here too.<br/><br/>I work professionally as a software consultant, but ever since I used HyperCard as a kid I’ve had an incurable desire to make it easier for programmers and non-programmers to create software. I recently went on a kick researching the history of HyperCard and Smalltalk, and that’s how I found out about Future of Code.<br/><br/>I think I’ve finally settled on a side project that both scratches my itch for the kind of software I want to create for myself, and also enables non-programmers to do the same. My post in #share-your-work gets into more details.<br/><br/>A great place to reach me is on Mastodon: <a href="https://tdd.social/@CodingItWrong">https://tdd.social/@CodingItWrong</a>

Hello. Just got invited while talking literate coding over on the Rands Leadership Slack.<br/><br/>Been doing dev since my early teens in the 90s and coding professionally since 2005ish. Currently a Director of software Engineering at BlocPower where I moved recently, here's a blog post I wrote about my job hunt <a href="http://georgemauer.net/2022/11/20/job-hunt-2022-retrospective.html">http://georgemauer.net/2022/11/20/job-hunt-2022-retrospective.html</a><br/><br/>I'm a big fan of emacs as it demonstrates how far our tools are from where they <b>could</b> be. I use org-mode daily to do all sorts of stuff. In fact I did a talk on it at the last emacsconf (search for org workflows for developers)

Howdy! I’m <a href="https://eli.li/about">Eli</a> from Maine, in the US. I’ve lurked here for ages, but never really participated. I’ve always loved seeing what this community makes and talks about. It’s a breath of fresh air compared to so many other techy spaces. <br/><br/>Lately I’ve spent a lot of my personal programming time playing with ways to bring accessibility to “smol computing.”<br/><br/>I work as an accessibility person, somewhere between product and engineering. I once built an expert system to determine tennis rankings and another one to help manage “turf care” for golf courses :smiling_face_with_tear: :upside_down_face:

Hi all!<br/>I’m Emil, from Vienna<br/>Just read about your recent meetup on Twitter<br/><br/>I’ve been experimenting with tools for thought since ~2015, building a personal CRM which turned out to be a note taking app with daily pages and bidirectional linking, something we know from other apps too nowadays.<br/>Since recognising that what I built can be used for various things, I became interested in building modular software—environments that can be shaped by their users.<br/><br/>The member handbook says I might share a blog article in my intro. I think this one might be interesting to some of you: <a href="https://emilbruckner.substack.com/p/47-formable-mobile-app">https://emilbruckner.substack.com/p/47-formable-mobile-app</a>.  It talks about how users could create their own mobile experiences on desktop.

Hi folks :wave: been lurking for a bit but never introduced myself.<br/><br/>I'm from Argentina :mate_drink: living in The Netherlands :cheese_wedge: <br/><br/>At work I do mostly frontend, although been moving to full stack slowly. It was React for around 5 years and now with Elm and Haskell.<br/><br/>I'm curious about how AI will impact programming and Software Engineering. Here are some notes on the topic <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/gillchristian/Notes/How+will+AI+impact+Software+Engineering%3F">https://publish.obsidian.md/gillchristian/Notes/How+will+AI+&hellip;</a> (digital garden style, just a draft)<br/><br/>Also, a while ago I did a PoC of a <em>search by type signature</em> app for TypeScript (like Haskell's Hoogle). But I faced some challenges and never continued. I want to pick up the project again :tm:  if you have any literature on the matter it would ge really valuable (like static analysis to extract type information and search indexes data structures). Here are some random notes on the project <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/gillchristian/Notes/Thoughts+on+Tsearch">https://publish.obsidian.md/gillchristian/Notes/Thoughts+on+Tsearch</a> The project is running on <a href="http://tsearch.io">tsearch.io</a> but the search doesn't actually work

Hello! I’m Tom, heard about the last UK meetup a bit late but I’m back in London for a few weeks and remembered this community. I’ve done some work with decentralised apps/protocols in the past (actually years ago now) and currently leading product-eng ops at a hospitality startup. Very interested in applications of future tech which transcend the screen :)

Hi, I'm Jurian. I just started listening to the podcast, and I love Brett Victor, programming, design, and other stuff that comes up here. I create prototypes in a design research team at a large municipality. This seems like a very nice and interesting group and I'd love to learn more!

Hi, I'm Paul (from Karlsruhe, Germany) and I discovered the Future of Coding podcast only a few days ago, feeling it resonate a lot with visions and yearnings accompanying me for the last 30+% of my life and being soaked into a huge rabbit hole of great ideas.<br/><br/>When I was a kid, one of my hobbies was imagining a program mixer. I'd take two computer programs and the program mixer would spit out a new piece of software. It was a great feeling to think about all the possibilities that (imaginary) program mixer would give me. Later, I had some fun with Cycle.js and even wrote an own prototypical FRP framework with some different accents. I also contributed a little to Athens Research, which is still my personal knowledge base. Unfortunately, I have a hard time getting my long-term ideas to paper -- I definitely have to work on it.<br/><br/>Today, the more I think about programming, the more I feel that it's about organizing knowledge. A nice code base is like a well-written book. In both cases, a lot of refactoring, "debugging" and striving for consistency and clarity is required. (And source code is just one of many knowledge fragments in a project...) Sometimes, when our underlying theories change, we have to "reframe" an entire code or knowledge base. Maybe similar tools can help in both situations. Might there be a single tool for programming and knowledge organization?<br/><br/>Right now, I am reading some climate science to build an explorable explanation of the underlying history and epistemology for beginners. The heart of the explanation will be a series of simulations of various basic climate models (e.g. earth=blackbody, no regional variations etc.), all of them being simple enough to run in a web browser. The most complex model will take into account water vapor and the user will be able to fiddle with the parameters. I have a twofold interest in this project: I have a passion learning and explaining things. On the other hand, I'm struggling myself with basing my epistemology on solid ground and expect to learn a lot from how climate scientists (or other scientists) bootstrapped their epistemology. If someone's interested in working together, just text me! :)

Hi! I’m Matt Webb and mainly I write about speculative technology things on my blog at <a href="https://interconnected.org/home">https://interconnected.org/home</a> — and sometimes I work with startups and big companies too (mainly doing product exploration or strategy/writing). Lots of design thinking. Main interests are the multiplayer web, small groups, NPCs, new interfaces, physical computing/environments, cyborgs, and innovation/policy. I’m lurking here because I find this kind of thinking really inspiring, and I hope to come along to a meetup soon! I live in London, UK.

Hi everyone :wave: My name is Helder and I'm an independent HCI researcher from Brazil. One of the two main areas I focus on is discrete input optimization (keyboard-first interaction and optimized text-entry for assistive devices, VR, and things with few buttons/actuators). The other area of focus is end-user programming, which grew from the first.<br/><br/>My main personal project is called Keykapp, a "visual interactive predictive concatenative programming" interface I'll spare you from rambling on too much about right now, except to say that it's a bit like command palettes and smartphone virtual keyboards had a weirdo Turing-complete baby :)<br/><br/>I've seen some really cool visual concatenative programming things on the archives, and I'd love to talk more with anyone who's interested, and also learn more about what everyone is working on. Thanks!

Hi all!  my name is Jinder, I'm from Boston area. I recently discovered the pod and am so happy to find others who are experimenting with with coding and the tools used for coding.  I'm particularly thinking a ton about visualizing code as I write it. As I implement algorithms, I want to see the effects of my code changes on the data the algorithm is working on.<br/><br/>Simple example: sorting algorithms. How can I create an IDE that allows me to move through a sorting algorithm and visualize what it is doing when I change lines?<br/><br/>Anyways, excited to be here and looking forward to learning from you all!

Hello. I’m relatively new to the podcast/field, but after listening to a bunch of episodes over the last month I found the ideas presented resonated with me and/or inspirational, and helping shape my thinking of a new projects. I’m a technologist who has worked all over the stack, but mostly happy at the backend/systems layer. I’ve worked on operating system/security tools, web services, FPGA circuits - they all to me are roughly the same as it’s all just problem solving.<br/><br/>I currently work as research engineer at the University of Cambridge where I’ve been trying to come up with tools/libraries/abstractions to make it easier for the ecologists there to let them scale up their data-science without having to learn low level systems. I recently wrote some of that up, so I’ll post that to the #share-your-work channel shortly. I also spent some time in the last few years reading through old programming guides from the 80s/90s to try remind myself where we came from, and try to work out where it all went wrong :slightly_smiling_face: But I’m not into old computers as objects to get nostalgic about - I want to build useful things, rather than to let me wallow in the old, if that makes sense.

Hi guys! My name is David, I'm from Seattle and I am about to finish my undergrad after this school year. I discovered the pod yesterday, and the FoC community seemed exactly like the kind of community I've been looking for ever since I got into PLT/xenocomputing.<br/><br/>For the past year or so, I've been working on a project called <a href="https://github.com/dabernado/iris">IRIS</a>, which is a low-level reversible programming language and virtual machine designed for efficient reversible computing. If you don't know what reversible computing is, I recommend reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing">Wikipedia page</a> - basically, it's a form of computing where every program implements its inverse, meaning that each line of code has twice the semantic utility. Via the Landauer principle, reversible computing has the potential to become WAY more power efficient than traditional computing, in the order of magnitudes!<br/><br/>My dev setup is a Thinkpad T430 running Void Linux (musl) + hikari, and one of the high-res Thinkpad X61T models which I mainly use as an e-reader. Through my experiments with Plan 9 I have gained some familiarity with the xxiivv/merveilles community, with which it seems that FoC has a lot of crossover. I'm super excited to get to know y'all and learn a thing or two!

Hi I'm Tan. I'm interested in PL, learning experiments, UI's for data exploration / program state, and sussman/radul propagator work, distributed systems and new protocols.<br/>I'm fairly inexperienced as a developer, but hoping I can zero in on the things that interest me while I'm here.

Hello. <a href="http://aboutmako.makopool.com/">aboutmako.makopool.com/</a><br/>I'm a philosopher/writer in differential progress, which means I work to get a clearer picture of which kinds of technological progress will make the future of humanity better, and which will make the future worse, and then I tell people about that so that we can do more of the good kinds of progress (and ideally less of the bad kinds, but the drivers of negative progress are not always possible to influence, so it's better to focus on making good things rather than stopping the bad)<br/>(example of a bad progress differential: Life would be better now if we had discovered and proliferated the social technologies of structured transparency and cooperative bargaining, before we had discovered nuclear bombs. It would have made disarmament possible, while, as a result of not having those things, it is currently impossible.<br/>Example of a good progress differential: It is really good that we've discovered Far UVC sterilization lighting before we have built and proliferated at-home DIY bioprinters.)<br/><br/>I also design and make things.<br/><br/>I've been mulling over post-textual/projectional languages/languages designed around IDE integration, for a bit. I'm pretty sure we're going to want a thing where the language server's interpretations come through as <em>quiet code</em> insertions, usually seen as small indicator, a colored dot or square, and not fully spelled out until the user asks to see the full interpretation. By making implicit behaviors visible and negotiable in this way, we enable more of it, and that turns out to resolve some of the problems today's auto-impl systems, and maybe makes implicit parameters and implicit conversions less harmful, and generally removes dependencies on some completely opaque and non-negotiable kinds of implicit behavior.<br/><br/>I'm currently trying to make sure that the world's first social VR usershell turns out well. I'm not sure what this is going to entail yet, maybe something to do with getting <a href="http://spritely.institute/">Spritely Goblins</a> (distributed capability systems, currently primarily lisp-based) to work with WASM?? (which would make everything more hackable and interoperable, which leads to all sorts of social technologies being built for free and proliferating globally, which generally leads people to be more coordinated and intentional, which leads to a stronger global dialog and informal educational processes, which leads to... <em>many good things</em>) But still just trying to understand what's going on over there.

Hi all, I'm tharun from India. I"m currently pursuing my bachelor's degree(expected to graduate in 2023). I'm enthused to learn new things about programming.<br/>wanna know how did I end up here? here you go. I was feeling bored and opened HackerNews, and found "Stop Writing Dead Programs" by Jack Rusher (Strange Loop 2022) I watched the entire video, and at the end, he showed the factorial of a number using Hest by Ivan Reese. I went to his website and found this community and now I'm here:smile:.

Hello! :man-bowing: I'm Francisco. I'm based in the Bay Area (live in Berkeley, work anywhere in SF); by way of ~Lisbon~, ~Berlin~, and ~Los Angeles~.<br/><br/>I'm a designer. I work at the intersection of communication, product, and prototyping with code (cough cough... and lots of Webflow). I'm here because I have a bit of a masochistic, pseudo-philosophical, love for computers and code. A fascination for understanding what computers are, what we could do with them, and how to communicate their magic to a non-technical audience. Think me explaining what a great tool-for-thought a function is to my grandmother at Christmas.<br/><br/>In terms of projects I'm currently going through a bit of a reset; reading a lot, taking inventory. But ultimately, with the goal to define an area of research through which to grow my skills. I'm here by way of <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mary Rose Cook</span> 's notion page. She absolutely does not know me but I recently stumbled upon her notion and am currently reading it like a fanboy reading LOTR.<br/><br/>Lastly, here's two posts I wrote a while back to explain some basic programming ideas to my ... gramma? :P<br/><a href="http://francsco.com/post/unpacking-the-computer">francsco.com/post/unpacking-the-computer</a><br/><a href="http://francsco.com/post/three-core-ideas-in-a-programming-language">francsco.com/post/three-core-ideas-in-a-programming-language</a><br/><br/>Excited to poke around and see what everyone is up to!<br/>Francisco<br/><br/>PS: :headphones: Obsessed with Nils Frahm, Hania Rani, the Grandbrothers, and anything neo-classic-meets-electronic.

Hello! I'm Jarno from Southern Finland. I found this amazing community while doing research for my own project. I've been lurking around for a while, but thought maybe I'll introduce myself and start taking part in some of the discussions :). I've been writing code for around 15 years, working most of my professional career as a consultant. Currently I'm working both as a freelancer and on my own fore mentioned unreleased textual low-code/no-code (business) logic programming solution. I've been working on and thinking about the project since 2016-2017, mostly only occasionally, but recently also full time. The project has taken many turns on the way, but I certainly hope I can share some progress within months, not years!

Hey everyone! I’m new to software development (have been skilling up for the last couple years towards a full-time position) but have always been deeply fascinated by technology and it’s usage. My more immediate background is in math eduction. Love thinking about the classic paradigms and how the inform how we think about and use software, and what new metaphores can be created. Glad to be here!

Hello folks! My name is Jonathan but I go by "J3RN" in many places on the net (there are also other J3RNs, so beware).  I've been programming for a bit over a decade now with most of that time spent doing web development.  Specifically, I worked in Ruby on Rails for ~5 years and have been working in Elixir and Phoenix for ~4.  I've never really been satisfied by the tools available and have been longing for a way to help developers comprehend software systems.  I'm interested in programming languages, IDE design, code visualizations, and other developer-centric HCI topics.<br/><br/>I'm currently located in Ohio, so let me know if you're in-state and maybe we can meet up (or establish a meetup!)

Hi everyone! I'm Lu (or Luke - either is fine) and I use the <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Lu Wilson</span> handle in most places. For around 7 years, I was a teacher for young kids with additional needs - but in January I left that to dedicate more time to coding. I'm currently working as a freelance developer+designer!<br/><br/>I really like expressing myself with creative coding, and I share my stuff in some <a href="https://youtu.be/Q4OIcwt8vcE">slightly-surreal videos</a>. I enjoy making unusual programming languages+systems that let you think about things <a href="https://youtu.be/sQYUQNozljo">visually+spatially</a>. I'm also helping to make a drag-and-drop tool for making cellular automata called <a href="https://youtu.be/ecCVor7mJ6o">Sandspiel Studio</a>.<br/><br/>And I'm going to the next London meetup! Come say hello! :)

Hey everybody! My name is Eric Normand. I'm a software engineer and writer. I currently live in Madison WI. I love ideas.<br/><br/>I've always been interested in how computers can help us understand the world and ourselves. Nicholas Negroponte put it best in paraphrasing Seymour Papert: "computer programming was a way to think about thinking and debugging programs was pretty close approximation to learning about learning".<br/><br/>I have a lot of work colleagues who are more of the "I like to make the computer do stuff" kind of engineers. They like to learn about kubernetes and the intricacies of AWS APIs. Those things bore me. I want to explore ideas by building.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what draws me to this community. I've listened to the podcast. And I'm intrigued by the many projects I see in this Slack. I have many incomplete projects, but nothing worth showing to others. Sometimes UI intrigues me (I love the intricacies of getting the interactivity just right). But again, very few things to show. I fear I wouldn't be able to do it professionally. I also love teaching and have tried to build "interactive explanations".<br/><br/>I hope to see you around the chat.

Hi!<br/><br/>I'm currently a postdoc working on data visualization (currently mostly network visualization).<br/><br/>I have some work-in-progress that I can share "soon".<br/><br/>I've been listening to the Future of Coding podcast (and receiving the newsletter) for a while now. I can't remember how I initially heard about it - possibly via Twitter.

Hey everyone!<br/><br/>I found out about this community when I was giving a product demo for a new product I’ve been working on. It’s a <a href="https://subset.so/">spreadsheet app</a> meant to make spreadsheets more modular and reusable (similar to code being found on Github and being reused). The idea is that Excel/Google sheets is effectively a programming language, but just missing a lot of the tools that programmers have. Currently the direction is a more visual spreadsheet on an endless canvas (like Figma) with the ability to build automated unbreakable spreadsheets meant to be shared for others to use.<br/><br/>I’m interested in:<br/>How we can build an easier to use spreadsheet that does not require years of banking or data experience to be able to run complex analysis<br/>Why the same analysis is run over and over, yet people generally start from scratch when building their own<br/>What are some analysis/apps that people wish they had (perhaps even daily net worth trackers), but don’t because it’s too hard to build or maintain<br/><br/>I’d love to meet and talk to anyone interested in the space. I’m in SF and would love to mete up in person too. Looking forward to see what everyone else is up to in this channel. :face_with_cowboy_hat:

Hey all, I’m Daniel! :wave:<br/><br/>I came here via the podcast and have been lurking in Slack for a while. This is such an awesome community! About me: I just finished a stint at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, where I was working on (and still am) <a href="https://a.methodable.com/">Methodable</a>, a “<a href="https://humanprogramming.substack.com/p/the-untapped-potential-of-human-programming">human-programming</a> tool”. Or to put it another way, a tool for creating, storing, and following complex human workflows / routines / processes. I recently put out <a href="https://a.methodable.com/guide/e0412eb2-36fd-4903-b186-d2de931fefc7">an extensive interactive guide</a> (which is itself a human program, of course) about how to use Methodable and the theory behind it.<br/><br/>I’m interested in question like:<br/>• How can non-technical people use programming to improve their lives?<br/>• How can we create fluid programmability without written syntax? How far do visual interfaces get us?<br/>• What things are people good at and what things are computers good at and how can we create programs that employ the strengths of both human and computer?<br/>I’m currently in San Francisco, and would be stoked to meet anyone out here! Or to meet people online, anyways, just excited to be here and see what you all are up to! :smiley:

Hey folks!

I quit my job to take a bit of a break at the start of July though so now i'm happily unemployed :smile:. my interest in FOC type stuff grew out of exploring ways to teach programming (a very long time ago i started <a href="http://eraseallkittens.com">eraseallkittens.com</a>), but since then has evolved into a general sort of interest in what programming actually is and why, and what it might look like if more people could engage with computation more on their own terms than they do now.<br/><br/>right now im trying not to think about computers because "taking a break" but i am anyway :skull: im based in london, if you are too say hi at the next meetup :relaxed:

Hi h! I’m Dustin.<br/><br/>After watching a few early 90s product demos on Jack Rusher’s Twitter, I found out about this Slack group. I’m endlessly curious about how we shape the tools we use and how the tools shape us. Following this curiosity introduced me to engineering and design. Work-wise, I’ve held various engineering and design roles: I worked at Walt Disney as a Software Engineer building the game engine for Club Penguin (RIP Flash), led the design team for the initial launch of Medium, and most recently,  I’m surrounded by a group of very talented and creative folks <a href="https://thebrowser.company/">building a new web browser called Arc</a>. Some recent work I’m proud of was exploring a playful UI to choose a color — <a href="https://twitter.com/dustin/status/1508500466505699331">https://twitter.com/dustin/status/1508500466505699331</a><br/><br/>Excited that this community exists.

Hello Friends,<br/><br/>I've been kicking around this Slack since roughly the get-go, since Steve Krouse started the FoC podcast, since before the introduce-yourself channel, so I've never introduced myself properly.  You'll most often find me sharing Rubyisms, mixed reality musings, spacial computing speculations, and the rare Aspect Oriented reflection, while being mostly busy writing little, tricky Rails apps for running big auctions.  What with a good chunk of 5G spectrum allocated and 6G only a glint, I have the chance to dedicate some proper time to FoC projects.  I want to work on something!  Who is looking for a comrade, a consultant, a hired hand, or to just chat?<br/><br/>Most anything and everything I see on the FoC Slack matches my interests remarkably well.  Most recently, in the process of distilling lessons learned from fourteen years of modeling the domain of umpteen slightly yet significantly different auctions, a shockingly beautiful conceptual crystal sublimated, a not-so-future-required technique for leveraging data's functional dependencies to make long-distance object referencing reasonable.<br/><br/>For instance, with <tt>the.package_bid = some_package_bid</tt>, we can talk about <tt>the.price</tt>, <tt>the.bidder</tt>, even <tt>the.previous(:round).price</tt> short for what might usually amount to going up and down a tree:<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">some_package_bid.area_bid.round_bid.round.previous.<br/>  round_bid(some_package_bid.area_bid.round_bid.bidder).<br/>  area_bid(some_package_bid.area_bid.area).<br/>  package_bids(some_package_bid.encumbrance_level).<br/>  find{_1.option == some_package_bid.option}.<br/>  price</pre>

Hi all.  I'm Niall, working as a research software engineer currently.  In the past I worked on visual programming tools (node-and-link variety) and picked up some experience of what can work and what may not.<br/><br/>I'm currently working on an open source framework (python/javascript) to help users apply visual programming to explore and process earth observation (EO) data.  I'm also starting to look at some other application areas (building database queries and deep/transfer learning) to see if the framework can be re-usable.<br/><br/>Interested to find out what other folks in this community are working on and share ideas!<br/><br/>All the best!<br/>Cheers<br/>N

:wave: Hey there, I’m Justin. I found Future of Coding accidentally when I was searching for something from <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span>. I have <em>so many</em> hours of podcasts to catch up on now, and it looks like there’s a ton of interesting content here too!<br/><br/>I’ve long thought (like so many others here I’m sure) that programming (and software development in general) should be easier, and that’s probably why I joined Zapier a little over eight years ago. :smile: I think we’ve done a pretty good job taking what once was a pretty difficult task of integrating multiple APIs and made it approachable for normal folks. But I’ve always had an itch that we should know more about which programming concepts are easier and which ones are more difficult. Especially since we’ve become more like a programming language over time, by adding things like branching, looping, and functions.<br/><br/>So this year, I was lucky enough to take a break from my job as engineer/architect and spend most of my time researching end-user development. The business goal is ultimately to make Zapier easier to use, either by learning how to improve our core product or add on other products. But I’m also personally interested in trying to make a small dent in this space.

Hello, I am Stefan, software engineer.<br/><br/>I have spent most of my career in data warehousing, almost everything from tool making to architecture. I am author of Cubes - former light-weight data warehouse toolkit in Python, now discontinued.<br/><br/>Exploring alternative ways of “problem modelling”, especially for the domain complex systems. From engineering perspective that lead me to a curious question: whether “everything is a graph” programming language is feasible and if yes, how it would look like.<br/><br/>Currently prototyping a library and a tiny domain specific programming language for modelling and simulation of dynamical systems. (Might release a prototype soon).<br/><br/>Happy to be here. Cheers.

Hi everyone! :grin: I am Josh. (PullJosh on the internet)<br/><br/>I am a college student now, planning to become a high school math &amp; computer science teacher.<br/><br/>As a kid, I spent almost all my time on Scratch, where I found a community of like-minded kids who loved to code.<br/><br/>Nowadays, I’m mostly doing web development. I love it, but I haven't found the same community as I had on Scratch.<br/><br/>To that end, I am trying to build a visual web coding tool that serves much the same purpose as Scratch did for me. It should be a gentle on-ramp to web development that encourages expressing yourself, building &amp; hacking together, and sharing your work.<br/><br/>Hopefully it can happen. :crossed_fingers:

Hey y'all :wave: I'm currently working at Ably, where we create APIs and SDKs to make it easier to build live and collaborative products (read: pub/sub and occupancy/presence… but with a few neat additions and more to come). I love studying the history of computing and the internet and (no surprise here) thinking about the future of it. I’m most interested in ‘groupware’ and how we might think schematically to make the objects we collaborate on more portable and interoperable. Looking to learn from, collaborate with and share with folks here :pray:

Hello :slightly_smiling_face: I’m Alexey. Found the community thru <a href="https://jasonmorrissc.github.io/post/2022-02-24_no-code/">Code vs. No-Code</a> blog post of <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jason Morris</span> (btw, thanks, it precisely illustrates a lot from my thoughts and vision).<br/><br/>Having 20+ years of building no-code-like tools (web CMS, UI builders, visual programming tools), now, I work on a new platform that will allow building UI applications (web and mobile) without coding by end-users.<br/><br/>I can talk a lot about that, but the main goals I have for this new platform are:<br/><br/>1. No vendor lock-in.<br/>2. Framework agnostic.<br/>3. Real-time collaboration.<br/>4. The best UX balance between flexibility and simplicity.<br/><br/>Looking for likeminded people :)

Hey all, I'm Prithvi. I found out about this community via a HN post yesterday. There's so much interesting content in this Slack workspace, it's going to take me days to catch up!<br/><br/>My primary work this last couple of years has been to enable non-frontend folks to build interactive software on their own. I've also built interactive visualization/analytical software in the past, and until recently was working with Leland Wilkinson (author of Grammar of Graphics) on several of these ideas. I've explored visual programming in the past, and probably most popular UI development tools/paradigms dating back to Visual Basic in the late 90s, Max/MSP, LabVIEW, etc.<br/><br/>I work with a lot of smart folks who're not developers professionally, but use Python/R/Julia every day. A majority of them want to be able to independently experiment and develop applications that makes analytical insights from AI/ML (decision-support) more accessible to non-experts.<br/><br/>To that end, I'm building <a href="https://github.com/h2oai/nitro">Nitro</a>, which offers a simple way to build web (and soon mobile/desktop) apps, trying to condense UI programming down to the simplicity of usiing <tt>INPUT</tt> and <tt>PRINT</tt> in BASIC. It's a brand new project, and time will tell if this approach will get popular. Fingers crossed :-)<br/><br/>I'm really excited to be sharing ideas here and conversing with you.

Hi there, I am Etienne. I have been working on Jig (<a href="https://www.jigdev.com">https://www.jigdev.com</a>) which is a canvas version of Observable notebooks. This hasn’t really had the success I hoped for so far. I think this is due to javascript being too hard for most people. I am joining here to see what people are working on in that space. From France

Hey all I’m Scott, a programmer in san francisco. I found FoC through Ivan. I was looking for a community to discuss ideas, especially with so little physical community during the pandemic. Im working on a fast flowchart editor, and some web hacks like a url based game. I want a place to support each other’s work since it seems most big ideas come from strong communities like homebrew etc.

Hello, I'm Vašek. I work in academia (theoretical informatics). Searching for some programming podcasts today I stumbled upon FoC and I was quite impressed. I listened to 4 of the podcasts, the last was the 46 Community Survey. I found myself crying at the end as the answers in "What does 'Future of Coding' mean?" resonated well with me. I hope to become part of this community by overcoming my introverted nature and realize moonshot dreams about the future.

Hey all!  I'm Evan, I'm a Frontend dev from the US, but living in Europe for 13+ years (and around Barcelona now for almost 7!).  Found this group via Maggie, who was a guest on my (now on hiatus) podcast, Frontend Heroes.<br/><br/>I'm also interested in how the pieces are going to fit together when it comes to ML and AI, specifically I would really like the artist things that could come out of it, if we leave curation as an important part of the process (for example, not just feeding an ML pipeline a bunch of fugues as waveforms, but also proving the sheet music so there's context, and then leaving moments in the process open to human input to end up with more realistic results.  Sort of like "playing" the computer as an instrument)

Hi all, I'm Jim :wave: I enjoy working in the space where design and code meets. I've worked directly with UX teams on design systems, but I also go way in the other direction, having worked on compilers and developer tooling like the GraphQL plugin for WebStorm.<br/><br/>Currently obsessed with making designers fall in love with code through better design tools. Latest thinking: Code should invite shaping in the same way that clay does for car designers. Design experiments with code should be visual and fun with instant feedback.<br/><br/>Have already found tons of interesting threads in here. Looking forward to many more to come :slightly_smiling_face:

Hello, I'm Mario. A London-based software engineer. I mostly work on backend/system software but I'm very interested in how we could improve the way we code.<br/>I've been listening to the podcast for a while and I just realised that there is also this Slack community, which I'm sure has a lot of interesting content and discussions

Hello, friends! My name is Mark, and I've been vaguely noodling on the future of building webapps for the past few months. I am delighted to have discovered this community! I'm a frontend developer by trade. I currently work as an engineer in residence at a VC firm, kicking the proverbial tires on new tech platforms and frameworks. Previously, I was an early engineer at Slack and, in the ever-receding distance of my memory, at Twitter as well.

Greetings. As someone deeply involved in computing, I've always felt rather conflicted about it. On the one hand, the unbounded potential of the dynamic medium has oriented my life for as long as I've been in contact with it. However, not long after I began to learn its workings did I grow disappointed by the imperfections inherent within our computing environments. More than anything else, the limits they face are not imposed by intractable reality, yet rather the uncontrollable buildup of accidental complexity that all but the most carefully engineered software projects are liable to. There has to be some way of building that avoids these traps systematically and easily.<br/><br/>In the past few months, I've come to the realization that the object-oriented idea offers the clearest way out, despite being maligned by a few popular yet flawed languages that poisoned the idea in the programmer mindshare.  A new generation of scripting languages have embraced it to varying success (Ruby more than others IMO), but nothing approaches Smalltalk/Self levels of object uniformity or CLOS levels of metacircularity. What's missing, I feel, is something that picks those threads back up and takes advantage of modern affordances to make something radically simpler and human oriented, and I have been exploring language design space towards that end.<br/><br/>It's exciting to find a community of people who see the same problems in this critical field, and I hope to learn from your points of view as we all take our stabs at the problem. The current state of programming is alarming, as evidenced by the growing number of people seeking to change something about it. My hope is that ours is the generation that succeeds in doing so.

Hi all, I'm a developer from Hull, UK. I've been working on creating more fluid interactions for code editing for the past few years, mostly based on the idea that to move something you should be able to just drag and drop it, and other variations on matching the interaction to the underlying thought process. I've implemented a few of these ideas in my latest project, Treefrog (<a href="https://treefrog-editor.com">https://treefrog-editor.com</a>). I'm hoping to organise a meetup in York, UK this summer - DM me if you're interested in getting together!

:wave:  Hey everyone, my name is Brett Neese and I split my time between Puerto Vallarta and Mexico City, Mexico at the moment. I am a software engineer by day and I am studying for a master's degree in cybernetics (which is hard to define but tl;dr I think a lot about <em>systems</em> of all kinds from a philosophical perspective) at DePaul University at night (I built my own degree program).<br/><br/>Currently I'm thinking a lot about <em>emergence</em> in computing (and even writing some of it down!). A friend sent me a link to the latest episode of the podcast which I found particularly relevant to the work I was already doing. It actually started me down a bit of a rabbit hole and now I'm here.<br/><br/>I don't just write theory, either, I'm also a bit of an artist (or trying to be one). I think that art can provide a glimpse into what a different world would look like so I'm trying to tie the two together. You can read some of my writing here <a href="https://queerinterfac.es/tagged/essays">https://queerinterfac.es/tagged/essays</a> and find more about me here: <a href="http://www.brettneese.xyz">http://www.brettneese.xyz</a>

Also coming from HYTRADBOI. Living in Berlin.<br/><br/>I think programming should be way more visual and easily debuggable. We should be able to visualize our projects structure and execution flow. We should also be able to interact with state and data visually. I also think we need a new database closely tied to the frontend.

:wave: i also found my way here via HYTRADBOI. my interest is the intersection of coding, data modeling, time, and users. i’ve been toying with computers for decades, and working professionally as a developer for 2+ of them. my current interest is around a “what’s old again is new again” to use ledgers to track data changes, particularly around the devex in making this approachable to a wider set of developers.<br/><br/>most of my experience has been with end-user software, be it business applications, games, or trading systems. i also did a stint at a startup for a bit in the semantic web space in the mid-00's when it was the new web3.0. that definitely “poisoned” my mind (so to speak) in thinking about data models, schemas, interoperability, and dynamically reconfigurable software.<br/><br/>i love learning about new-to-me ideas, and look forward to chatting with you all.

<br/>
Hello all, I'm Chadwick. I'm an independent software developer, with most of my time devoted to the design and development of an app for the creation and management of patches/sounds for hardware synthesizers.<br/><br/>My work is essentially the creation of a unified platform for synth patch editors, as well as the implementation of dozens of editors on that platform. So over the years I've continually refined and refactored this codebase to make the experience of implementing new editors more elegant and simple. It's involved learning a lot about how to architect the system for flexibility to accommodate the different structures and needs of different synthesizers. And this sort of system is a fun programming context in which there is a central data model (the sound patch) but the user might want lots of different views and ways to operate on that data (e.g. views that give you access to every parameter, or views that give simplified/opinionated controls that affect multiple parameters, etc). The sound designer themselves is a kind of programmer, and I'd like to keep pushing my platform to new areas of tooling for these users.<br/><br/>The next frontier for me is the implementation of some sort of scripting language for the creation of new editors on my platform, to open that programming experience up to a larger audience, so I'm (just) starting to think more about programming language design and experience, and these future of coding discussions are really inspirational to me within that context.<br/><br/>I don't have my own future of coding project per se, but the topic is of great interest to me. I started listening to the podcast a long time ago, and only recently realized that there's a Slack, and I joined immediately. :slightly_smiling_face:

I don’t think I ever actually introduced myself. I’m sure most of you have seen me around on some thread or other, but figured I should probably do this officially.<br/><br/>If you listened to the latest episode, you will know me as a new cohost on the podcast. Super excited to join <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> in getting to think through some ideas, read some old papers, talk about interesting concepts in the “future of coding”.<br/><br/>But a bit about me. I do clojure for my day job, but have been loving rust lately. I love public speaking. I’ve got two talks on the youtubes about programming. One about a library a friend of mine made in clojure around term rewriting (the talk itself is pretty future of coding adjacent, if we crank that future to the nearer term). But also a talk about how philosophy of science relates to programming (Specifically are programming paradigms kuhnian paradigms).<br/><br/>As for my views on future of coding things, I’m not really a partisan. I think the most exciting thing about the work we all do here is the breadth, the explorations, the diversity of views. I have my opinions of course. But I think the future of coding has to include lots of views, many of which aren’t for me.<br/><br/>For my non-programming hobby, I love analytic philosophy. It is like the best parts of programming, but can be done in the armchair. Analytic philosophy is also very tied up in the history of computer science. The deeper you dive, the more similarities you find.<br/><br/>Finally, since we are going to be reading a lot on the podcast, I plan on posting on #reading-together regularly about the papers we are reading and others (will post there later today about todays episode). I hope this can serve as a nice place to have conversations about the episodes and to help pick paper to talk about on future shows.

Greetings, ah, Earthlings<br/><br/>My name is Ryan, I caught on to this community via the podcast episode with Ella Hoeppner, the generative art in particular caught my attention.<br/><br/>My background is in astronomy, I previously worked at the VLA and on JWST (glad THAT one went well). These days I do a lot of software development with image processing and computer vision.<br/><br/>I've been working on an image-based personal search engine for about 4 years now. I didn't know at the time I started it, but it's sorta kinda... very much like Vannevar Bush's Memex. It is a commercial project - happy to share it if that's appropriate.<br/><br/>Outside of that, I've been making a lot of tiny programs lately - a webpage that <a href="https://foxrow.com/wordle">always shows me yesterday's wordle</a>, a random-background-wallpaper-grabber (feels like getting a new computer!), putting <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">this data tracking technique</a> by Simon Willison (of Django fame) into practice.<br/><br/>Glad to be here, and I'm happy to chat if any of that sounds interesting!

Hello!<br/><br/>My name is Jeff, and a friend of mine clued me into this forum. A bit about me. I’m a semi-retired former principal engineer and my new life goal is to connect with why I got into this field in the first place: games.  My career was forged in distributed systems at Amazon S3 which prepared me to the architect of Facebook’s real-time infrastructure which manifested in a SOSP 21 paper: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477132.3483572">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477132.3483572</a><br/><br/>I've been working on a new programming language for a while called Adama, and I'm turning it into a data platform. This data platform will power a new collaborative IDE, and I’ll use this IDE to build board games. Board games are hard, and I love to play them. I’ve got my work cut out for me, but I’m having fun.<br/><br/>I have embarrassingly launched: <a href="https://www.adama-platform.com/2022/03/02/early-access-launch-and-confession.html">https://www.adama-platform.com/2022/03/02/early-access-launc&hellip;</a> with an open strategy: <a href="https://www.adama-platform.com/2022/02/24/open-strategy.html">https://www.adama-platform.com/2022/02/24/open-strategy.html</a> . I’m currently in the phase of “how do I even describe this thing” to cross various chasms. Fortunately, I’m betting on the end artifacts over the coming decades as I expect board games to still in exist in 10+ years.<br/><br/>I believe in mixing state and compute in a sane way, but this is exceptionally hard as you ultimately must build a database. At core, Adama enables people to DIY a real-time database. Fun enough, this work has connected me deeply to the Actor model as well as Alan Kay’s original meaning of object-orientated programming. A document with Adama is a siloed stateful object capable of receiving messages and emitting differential state updates to viewers.

Hi everyone :wave: I’ve been reading posts in this community for a while now, and I figure it may be time to finally introduce myself. <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Florian Schulz</span> and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Henning Sato von Rosen</span> separately told me about it some time last year. They’re both awesome people working on impressive projects, so I knew I had to come here :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>My background is a mix of business, programming, and design. My business school experience was pretty disappointing, so I started teaching myself programming and selling iPhone apps on the side shortly after Apple had created the App Store. The apps were super simple and had moderate success.<br/><br/>Following Apple’s guidelines and reading articles by other indie developers made me realize the importance of good design. That’s when I encountered Bret Victor’s essays for the first time, and they had a huge impact on me. I really enjoyed creating new products, and ended up moving from Poznań, Poland to Berlin, Germany, and working as a product designer for about ten years.<br/><br/>I enjoyed product design, but felt limited in the sense that I could envision certain ideas, but was incapable of implementing them myself. And pushing the envelope was not always a priority at my clients’ companies (understandably so). So I decided to take some time off and invest in learning programming for real.<br/><br/>After about three years of first learning programming fundamentals and then catching up with modern tools, I’m now building a paid learning resource and environment for people who want to learn CSS Flexbox layout. I’m following some of the guidelines outlined in Bret Victor’s Learnable Programming essay, like removing hidden state and letting you explore how a layout is constructed over time.<br/><br/>My other inspirations are books like <em>Uncommon Sense Teaching</em> (Oakley, Rogowsky, Sejnowski) for creating a curriculum and tools that make learning accessible to everyone, and <em>Understanding Comics</em> by Scott McCloud for employing visual communication and stories to better explain concepts.<br/><br/>I effectively had to reverse engineer how a browser engine calculates this type of layout so that I could show all the intermediate states to the user. This has been pretty challenging, but I think it could really make learning much easier compared to what it is today. I’m hoping to launch it some time in 2022. I’m a little scared talking about this project at this stage, because it doesn’t completely implement Bret Victor’s vision yet. But after a long time off work, I feel like I might need to settle for something less than perfect so I can start supporting myself with this independent business.<br/><br/>In terms of other projects, last year I was looking for better ways of modeling interfaces and got into statecharts. I really loved the original statecharts paper from David Harel. To get some practice, I built a replica of the wristwatch the author used for all the examples. The demo can be found at <a href="https://andyjakubowski.github.io/statechart-watch/">https://andyjakubowski.github.io/statechart-watch/</a>, and the source code at <a href="https://github.com/andyjakubowski/statechart-watch">https://github.com/andyjakubowski/statechart-watch</a>.<br/><br/>This ended up pretty long :grimacing: Anyway, I have huge respect for what you’re all working on in this community, and I’m looking forward to becoming a little more active here!

Hi everyone!<br/><br/>Just wanted to share my story and idea and maybe find someone that's been on similar thoughts or that is interested. Here comes a wall of text. Feel free to ask questions!<br/><br/>I've been thinking of a new form of computer communication for years now. My goals have been among others implicit abstractions similar to interfaces which include reusability, simple hardware and network integration, automatic data structure handling and implicit parallelization. I've been reading theoretical computer science on master level and was first very fascinated by LISP and Scheme, but after working in Business Intelligence and with analysis cubes and DAX for 2 years, my thoughts have been inspired by the idea of dimensions and the power that abstraction provide. However, I think DAX is very limited. What I've arrived at is a concept I call dimensional programming. By nature it is declarative and entirely based on setting dependencies between dimensions. My approach has similarities to algebra in how equality work in contrast to imperative programming. Although, it come with some distinct differences for handling dimension "types" effectively.<br/><br/>The primary idea is to model a computer as a space of input and output dimensions. Input dimensions being keyboard, mouse, camera, microphone, files etc. Output dimensions: monitor, speaker, files etc. Depending on the source or sink several dimensions are integrated, e.g. a monitor require xy-axis for pixels bound to rgb-color. A program effectively becomes a point that moves through this hyper space, propelled by time (which I believe is not a new idea).<br/><br/>The programming process consists of creating dependencies between input dimension and new intermediate dimensions until they reach output dimensions. The time dimension is key for most functionality and can be used to create virtual imperative programming when required. The programming engine is tasked with creating a program that guarantee the dependency between input and output dimensions for whenever the output dimension must show. This removes the programmers responsibility of saying when things should operate. Function calls and events are chosen, handled and optimized by the compiler.<br/><br/>It is possible to create dependent spaces of several dimensions to create basically modules. We then connect other dimensions to the ends (dimensions) to the module and then adapt the behavior. One of the charm with such modules are that they can be complex but we only need to compile and run the parts that has dependencies between input and output dimensions. Types are not a thing. Instead points are mapped between dimensions or based on the shape of a dimension, such as its cardinality which can be used accumulate things over time. Arithmetic is handled by dependencies from the number dimension onto itself based on operators. The fact that dimensions don't really use types seem to create this abstraction criteria I was looking for.<br/><br/>Compilation wise, input and output dimensions are implemented through an interface to provide deltas or full changes for the compiler to optimize the program with. The interface should be sophisticated enough to map to REST APIs or other programming languages or data sources.<br/><br/>There are plenty of theoretical difficulties with foremost avoiding circular dependencies. This has been a big trouble, but seems to be solvable null points of each dimension where no dependency exist as well as only considering direct chains of dependencies.<br/><br/>There are some very cool implications with these thoughts of dimensions. A number is just a dimension. A list of numbers is just a number dimension that depends on another discrete dimension. If statements are just points in spaces of one or more dimension causing other dependencies. Logical operations naturally convert in to something more like set theory. The current thought of syntax is very compact requiring few to none keywords. It mostly just looks like common list syntax and rely on pattern matching.<br/><br/>I'm in a fairly late stage theoretically and are aiming at creating a proof of concept soon, probably binding the console input field dimension accumulated over time to the output over the time dimension. But I'm also looking at using Vulcan to implement a monitor output dimension.<br/><br/><br/>There seem to be many other interesting potentials for the future:<br/>-We can have a computer dimension and program dimensions which allow very straight forward syntax for having programs communicating with each other across the internet.<br/>- We could get implicit inversion of dependency mappings, effectively making it possible to run programs or dependencies backwards (which could lead to program branching, but there is theory for that too).<br/>- I've also considered how to visualize such a program. Any pair of dimensions can for example be plotted on a regular 2D graph. In a sense the entire program is defined before it runs, although we can't know certain input dimension states ahead of time. It causes potentials for visual exploration and debugging.<br/><br/>Overall there is a lot of work to do and I will try to get the POC out to show a more concrete example, but until then I'm happy to talk about it!

Hey, everyone. I'm a self-taught coder who became a lawyer, who fell in love with the opportunities to use logic programming to do knowledge representation of laws, regulations, and the like, and who after 10 years as a lawyer went to get an interdisciplinary LLM in Computational Law. Finished that spring in 2021. Immediately afterwards spent a year working on the L4 language at Singapore Management University. Since last fall, I am the Director of Rules as Code at a Canadian federal government department. "Rules as Code" is a public administration, legislative drafting, and software development methodology that takes advantage.of isolated, machine-executable representations of relevant rules, as soon as possible in the process.<br/><br/>The big problem with Rules as Code is the tools. The best (not the most popular) tools are based in logic programming, because of the structural similarities to how laws are written. But people who build apps seldom do knowledge representation in logic programming. And giving better tools to only the coders doesn't solve the knowledge acquisition bottleneck problem. So we need tools that are realistic for subject matter experts to learn, and use.<br/><br/>On the basis that of a child can do it, so can a lawyer, I decided to try and build a user-friendly interface to the Flora-2 logic programming language based on Blockly, which came from MIT's work on Scratch. The result is <a href="http://www.Blawx.com">www.Blawx.com</a>.<br/><br/>My ideas about the features that a domain specific knowledge representation and reasoning tool for law should have keep changing as I learn, as well as my understanding of the best practices for user-friendly development environments.<br/><br/>I'm currently enamoured with the s(CASP) system, because I think answer sets and stable models with justifications have deep parallels in how law is read and understood. And automatic justification is an absolute necessity for trustworthy public systems, as is open source.<br/><br/>I'm working on satisfying myself that s(CASP) is an appropriate target language, after which I will start redesigning Blawx to use it.<br/><br/>I learned a lot about programming environment  design from some FoP content recently, and I'm here to learn more, and be exposed to more and better ideas, particularly in the user-friendly interface design space.<br/><br/>I am also eagerly waiting for the advent of the world's second big 3D programming environment, after Minecraft Redstone components.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the learning.

[ Disclaimer: I do not intend to convince anyone of the sweeping claims below, just enumerate some ideas that I have arrived at over the years, as a means of self introduction. ]<br/><br/>Hi all!<br/><br/>This is great community!<br/><br/>I’m into Language Design and Language Design Philosophy. In general I think we have a lot to gain from:<br/>&gt; A. Making our most fundamental abstractions simpler, more orthogonal and less complexity-inducing where applicable <br/>&gt; B. Aligning our most fundamental abstractions to human perception where applicable.<br/><b>[ You can stop reading here. That was the essential stuff; all the rest is ellaborations on the above and irrelevant personal stuff. Long boring text about stuff I find exciting follows… ]</b><br/><br/>Considering that Programming languages have quite a long history and all the brilliant insights and abstractions uncovered so far, one might think that most essential stuff under A and B above would have already found their way into current languages/PLD tradition. As far as I can see, that is not really the case at all and this means that:<br/>1. There is a lot to do in the field, and it can change the way we think about languages<br/>2. It’s pretty much ortogonal to other progress related to Future of Coding, so small gains at the core abstractions can make other endeavors, like visual tools etc both more useable and more implementable.<br/>3. The human language capacity runs on its own circuits in the brain and the work it performs does not count towards total cognitive load; it’s like an overpowered graphics gard -- all work that is a good fit for it and is pushed onto it is a great liberation of computational/cognitive resources for the CPU/general cognition.<br/>In short: Language Design and Language Design Philosophy can make a huge difference for programmers, end users and end user programmers alike. Many more possibilities remain unexplored than one might generally think.<br/><br/>Currently, I am tinkering with a project where I apply language design thinking to Hierarchical State Machines, designing and implementing a UI markup language with a readily graspable runtime visualization. It might be possible to extract some state machine-related generalizations from the work by someone with CS skills.<br/><br/>This is my personal perspective/motivation: I wanted to write programs and do stuff with CS for a long time, but dealing with some chronic stuff leaves me with brain fog and little energi to spare most days. Essentially, this means that I just cannot keep more than 20LOC i my head, and can’t really grasp big libraries and frameworks (I forget how to use them faster than I learn, and faster than I can look up stuff on stack overflow). So I pretty much despaired for a long time. But then I found that this also gives me some advantage; I can do something; namely, I can recognize the stuff that is small enough, logical enough and easy to think of enough. Such stuff I can actually keep working on even on  bad days. That made State machines and statecharts an instant love. Highly glanceable notations and straight-forward composition also helps a lot (that’s what I’m designing for the UI markup). And stuff that are logical with minimal or no inconsistencies means less to think about; less to have to keep in mind; that is also immensely helpful, so that is why I hope someone can derive a formalism from the generalizations that I derive based of the needs of the design process.<br/><br/>Frankly, It feels pretty uncomfortable to talk about what I do without having a working implementation and some loose ends in the theory. But hey, I might not even be able to finish the implementation by myself.<br/><br/>So here’s maybe my vision: In the ways that turns out to be possible to me, with the tools and collaboration that I find, I want to make progress towards tools and languages that cover more of their inherent potential.

Hello everyone,<br/>I've been interested in visual language design for general communication, especially communication of scientific and mathematical concepts in a rigorous manner, for a decade now. One goal is to put a stop to scientific handwaving by forcing explicit clarity, another is to allow for richer communication (more detail and precision without overburdening the audience), but the guiding philosophy is really to externalize thought as faithfully as possible. Telepathy is the ideal.<br/>I'm not a coder, so I was pleasantly surprised that what scientists have largely neglected is a hot topic (of sorts) in the world of software engineering. I hope to learn from you all and share ideas from an angle on visual thinking and communication you may not have encountered before.

Hello community,<br/>I've been here before but I'll introduce myself again: I'm Rodrigo Tello, a Mexican Brooklyn-based interface designer. My original background [or academically] is in architecture but as all of you, got in love [maybe?] with computers when we were 12 making websites and pressing "view source code".<br/><br/>The part of my career that might be the most relevant to this community was that I worked at Hopscotch, a programing environment &amp; language for kids, for 5 years.<br/><br/>I have a couple of side projects at the moment, some more businessy some more exploratory/research-oriented that would be interesting to this community, I hope to share them soon.<br/>Some interests besides computing are playing guitar, synths, painting, arts in general.

Hey all, I wanted to (re)introduce myself and try to articulate why I’ve been so absent for those who might be interested in my experience. Sorry for the length…<br/><br/>I used to be very active here, but over some time I developed a kind of disillusionment with my own thinking. I could no longer connect the dots between much of the work being done and long-term aspirations. I became skeptical of our ability to express or communicate with each other around the systems we wish to build, design, or see emerge.<br/><br/>There’s a lot of deep discussion in this community that gets toward many major questions:<br/>- how can we make systems interoperable? what is interoperability?<br/>- in what ways could human-computer interfaces be different? How can we reason about interfaces?<br/>- how can we collapse the user-programmer divide? What would a dynamic medium look like?<br/>- what does it mean for computing to be truly participatory? What does participation and agency look like across scale and context?<br/>- What’s the difference between data, structure, behaviour? Are these all the same?<br/>- what are the limits of possibility derived from current theory and mathematics? With so many areas, where do we focus? (systems sciences, FLT, PL design, HCI, semiotics, knowledge representation, models of computation, etc)<br/>- many more<br/><br/>These big and often broad questions, lines of inquiry, and conclusions resemble a sort of theoretical-adjacent foundation for the work being done in this community. There’s also the opposite end: concrete, current, specific discussion that supports each others efforts and current projects.<br/><br/>With all these rich and amazing discussions, which so clearly have merit, I became even more disillusioned. Not only was I lacking the language to articulate my own goals and desires, but I also felt like existing knowledge was underutilised, with many amazing individuals unable to build on each others work, many contributions left unused. It began to feel like I was thinking in the wrong place, and trying to do the wrong things (for me, anyway).<br/><br/>So I ended up taking a year+ ‘pause’ with some key goals for myself:<br/>1. Become genuinely familiar with fields which address key, foundational problems, some key focuses for me were on:<br/>	a. Complex &amp; dynamical systems, control systems &amp; cybernetics<br/>	b. knowledge representation, information &amp; communication theory, linguistics &amp; FLT<br/>	c. distributed systems &amp; governance<br/>	d. lots and lots of math!<br/>2. Seek out a versatile but robust frameworks for reasoning that are portable across the computing landscape while remaining grounded in the material world.<br/>3. Explore what a <b>theory of change</b> grounded in systems sciences looks like, as a component of future-oriented work.<br/>4. Be academically rigorous and move towards more long-term research-oriented work<br/><br/>To cut a long story a bit short, I did some much needed re-orientation, discovering some really cool stuff along the way which I’m excited to share, and I have never felt better. I had to let go of a <b>lot</b> of ideas I held quite dearly, most of which I haven’t mentioned here. I’m actually more hopeful about the future of computing than I ever have been, but I’ve shifted positions quite a lot along the way.<br/><br/>I now also have a research job in this exact area — <em>knowledge interoperability in distributed socio-technical systems</em><br/><br/>I’m now very focused on understanding <em>representations</em> and <em>representation systems</em> — which are very under-theorised and often invisible to us, or left implicit. I’m hopeful we can develop common frameworks for understanding existing systems that also allow us to reason about entirely new systems. Lots of compelling work from knowledge representation and systems sciences here.<br/><br/>I’ve never felt so excited about a research direction before, and it’s already churned up some super compelling stuff. I couldn’t cram any actual theory contributions into this message, but I hope my excitement is contagious!<br/><br/>I’m glad to be back, y’all are fabulous. &lt;3

I came across Future Of Coding while doing a random search on the Internet for Alan Kay fans! Thank you <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> for this community! I’m an imagineer and protocol designer and believe also that the computer revolution has not happened yet. I’m this guy: <a href="https://awake.vc/amit">https://awake.vc/amit</a><br/><br/>I’m here to indulge my first loves: functional programming, distributed computing, new abstractions, smart people, early-stage startups, alien tech. I would love to contribute in various ways to cool projects I’m sure you all have. I also have a couple of new side projects I’m looking to find kindred spirits for, one has to do with a better software stack for modern Internet applications, and the other is a new Tangle-type abstraction for shared secrets.<br/><br/>Oh, in what seems like a past life, I wrote Clojure in Action (<a href="https://awake.to/clojure">https://awake.to/clojure</a>).

I have to confess I’ve been lurking in this group for a couple years now. Last week I listened to a couple episodes, and it inspired me to #introduce-yourself.<br/><br/>I recently founded an internal tools company (<a href="http://www.flank.cloud">www.flank.cloud</a>). It’s a standard enterprise CRUD app, nothing too crazy compared to some of the other projects here, but between the cloud, frontend frameworks, and managing environments, there’s already enough complexity that I’m wondering if we can’t build our own tools to cut through it. I’m also wondering to what extent we can use our tool to build our tool. (The answer right now is not at all.)<br/><br/>Anyway, I really enjoy dropping in here, so thanks for all the good chatter and energy that happens here. DM me if you want to chat! If you’re in Austin TX, I am too. Always up for a coffee even though I don’t drink coffee.

Howdy folks, I'm yet, I use they them pronouns, and have been programming for a while but recently dug into the podcast cause of the Orca/100r episodes, big indieweb nerd (Elliott Cost is to blame) and I guess that world and this one are kinda a Venn diagram of sorts. Interested in generative/experimental social experience and data visualization (D3!) And urban Ag tech and racket and looking back to look forward. New to the future of coding so I will be more of a listener but I'm so glad to have found y'all :relaxed::relaxed::non-potable_water:

Hi! I was recommended the podcast a couple years back, and have enjoyed several episodes a lot.<br/><br/>More recently, I was recommended to check out the slack in conversation with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Eric Gade</span> and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Daniel Krasner</span> (thanks for the recommendation :slightly_smiling_face:).<br/><br/>My principle interests for the last while have been:<br/><br/>• Philosophy of communication and community<br/>• PLT, especially in relation to the above, and in relation to philosophy of logic and logical foundations, and with a soft spot for logic programming. The kinds of transformation in programming I'm keen on go in hand-in-hand with fundamental insights into logic, ontology, and communication (as the medium of community).<br/>• Cooperativism, the social and solidarity economy, and (left) utopian political prefiguration more generally<br/>That said, my activities are often not much beyond dabbling in this or that.<br/>Outside of work, most of my programming is the OCaml ecosystem.<br/><br/>Happy to be here and I look forward to learning from the conversations.

Hi all! I found out about this Slack group from <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andrew Condon</span>, thanks for sharing it with me!<br/><br/>I’m Mike, and most of my work with coding these days involves creating interactive musical environments through code. I’ve spent many years programming in SuperCollider and CSound and have made work at places like the Grame in Lyon and IRCAM in Paris. The prevailing approach in most French music institutions was to make digital music creation low-code or no-code. Over time, I’ve developed a different opinion: code, like natural language, is a powerful way not only to express our ideas but also learn and develop new ideas. I think this is especially true with functional programming, where the process of constructing proofs in the type system leads to creative epiphanies that make their way into one’s art (in my case, into my music).<br/><br/>If you’re into functional programming and music, I’d encourage you to check out <a href="https://wags.fm">https://wags.fm</a> (gh repo <a href="https://github.com/mikesol/wags.fm">here</a>) and <a href="https://mikesol.github.io/sf">https://mikesol.github.io/sf</a> (gh repo <a href="https://github.com/mikesol/sf">here</a>). Contributions and new perspectives are always welcome! I’m very much looking forward to learning from all of you.

<b>Hello everyone!</b> :wave:<br/><br/>First let me address the important things in life :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: :<br/>• programming language of choice: <em>Clojure</em><br/>• editor: <em>Emacs</em><br/>Current status:<br/>• co-organising <a href="http://reclojure.org">reclojure.org</a> conference (used to be in London, now on-line, free, and happening next week, everyone’s invited!)<br/>• building <b>Nette: Research OS for the Web</b> (I’m very, very open to a less cheesy tagline)<br/><em><b>Nette</b></em> is something that I’ve always wanted for myself.<br/>Way to gather all kinds of diverse types of media (tweet is a medium) on a visual canvas which is also an information system<br/>-- with each gesture of the UI evolving the system and being remembered.<br/><br/>It’s focused on expressiveness and agency over information. And eventually being collaborative and programmable.<br/>More about powerful ways of seeing/understanding and “doing with information”, rather than producing artifacts.<br/><br/>The only things that’s public atm is this cheeky teaser, doesn’t explain much, but I’m happy to give a demo to anyone who wants to listen and give feedback…<br/><br/> <a href="https://vimeo.com/640304817/13aaa16679">https://vimeo.com/640304817/13aaa16679</a><br/><br/>Looking forward to hanging out more around here. I would really appreciate any feedback whatsoever :heart:<br/>Thanks!

Hi everyone! I am Gleb, by day an engineer at Coda, by night working on my chrome extension <a href="https://ampie.app">ampie.app</a> which shows twitter &amp; HN discussions for the page you are on (written in Clojure and Clojurescript, the extension is <a href="https://github.com/posobin/ampie">open-source</a>). In the past I was pursuing a PhD in theoretical CS at Columbia but dropped out a year ago. In the past couple of months I have been thinking about creating a new programming language together with an environment, but my thoughts on it are very rough and it seems like a daunting project. I have been aware of the FoC community probably for a year or two now, decided to get more involved to see what people are working on and also post my own ideas/explorations at some point. Excited to be here!<br/><br/>Also, you can find me in NYC and on twitter, that's where I usually hang out: <a href="https://twitter.com/posobin">@posobin</a>.

Hi, I’m Andrew, i’m a programmer working with PureScript and Haskell and steadily inching forward this personal <a href="https://github.com/afcondon/purescript-d3-tagless-II">project</a> out of a belief that there’s an interesting and under-explored area of the future of programming that uses data-visualization techniques to create user interface elements that are more than decoration or illustration.<br/><br/>I don’t remember how i first found the mailing list for Future of Coding which i’ve been on for a while, but it was probably via Kevin Lynagh’s newsletter.

Hey everyone! I'm working on a <b>new vision for the terminal</b> - one that uses plain english.<br/><br/>To that end, I've been building <a href="https://rosieos.com">Rosie</a> for the past few weeks, and a friend mentioned I come here. It's still really new, but it's a step forward. If you've ever spent 15 minutes crawling StackOverflow to figure out some specific CLI command, then Rosie is for you. Just type in plain english what you'd like to do, and Rosie will give you the CLI command.<br/><br/>More importantly, in the <a href="https://fofcudps6xn.typeform.com/to/QHgIC8bF">desktop app</a>, Rosie will actually run the command. Coupled with a revamped file explorer (think Superhuman, but Finder), I think we can really change this archaic part of coding.<br/><br/>I hope you guys like it! Excited to be part of this community.

So excited to meet everyone here! I'm John, the founder and creator of the Primitive <em>Immersive Development Environment</em>. I started Primitive in 2015 because I wanted to create the IDE of the future. I believe the future of programming is collaborative, immersive, and powered by spatial computing and artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>The Primitive IDE is my life's work. It is a collaborative 3D/VR environment where users explore codebases to learn, review, and debug code in an unlimited environment. A few things that makes Primitive unique:<br/>• Primitive crawls GitHub and has a fully explorable mapping of the top repositories<br/>• Anybody can view their own code on their local machine and see a directory and file mapping in a 3D spatial layout<br/>• Programming files are parsed by a variety of tools (ANTLR, Roslyn, Clang, JavaC) to show their AST structure and to enable animated reference maps in the 3D space<br/>• For Java, Primitive can display multi-thread runtime traces and a memory graph in the 3D environment<br/>• There is also a backend that integrates with Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab and automatically analyzes your private repos to share with your team. This is great for code walkthroughs and onboarding<br/>• The backend does AST diffing in git, and will show you changes in the codebase as a 3D model. This is amazing for code review, because it's very easy to see what has changed in a PR<br/>• Finally, and most experimentally, we have a voice-controlled Codex implementation. This is the future that I'm most excited about: a team of people asking a machine to generate code, that gets displayed and tested in a 3D VR environment. Here is a demo: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icHLoxOFerk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icHLoxOFerk</a><br/>I'm glad to have discussions about spatial computing and AI enabled programming. I just discovered this community and I'm excited to hear about what everyone is working on.<br/><br/><a href="https://primitive.io/">https://primitive.io/</a><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/PrimitiveVR">https://twitter.com/PrimitiveVR</a>

Hello Friends! I am Owen, an ex-Google/ex-Facebook person working in SF on the future of coding.<br/><br/>My background / journey in this space:<br/>• I worked on Google Chrome for 3 years, leading Progressive Web Apps and the future of x-platform development<br/>• I concluded it was possible to build amazing web apps, but far far too hard<br/>• I am disappointed nobody has solved “write once, run everywhere”, but where the output is UI native to the target SDK (and includes Web Support), and adapted to the OS / form factor of the device <br/>• I became very interested in React Native development and love following the advancements in the React space<br/>My conclusions:<br/>• I believe we need to start coding at a way higher level of abstraction, i.e. describing the features of our products at a semantic level rather than UI and in terms of complex low-level logic<br/>• If we can increase the level of abstraction for coding for certain classes of apps I believe we can enable:<br/>    ◦ “Write once run everywhere”, but where the high level descriptions of products can be compiled into super polished native UIs best suited to the form factor of the target device.<br/>    ◦ Making it 1000X easier for people to build apps and web apps, since describing a feature semantically is far easier than at an implementation level<br/>My vision for the future of coding consumer software:<br/>• I want people to be able to re-build products like AirBnB by simply describing (in a formal Domain Specific Language, via a slick web GUI) the things users can do in the app, and then for the platform to compile this down to super polished UIs for every OS, plus auto generate a production backend.<br/>I’m working on this space at a new company I recently founded in San Francisco called Sutro, here’s a post with a bit more detail, and I’d love to feedback or to chat with folk any time interested in this! <a href="https://www.notion.so/Intro-to-Sutro-raising-the-level-of-abstraction-for-programming-by-multiple-orders-of-magnitude-06f2566973714b3298d8f3cf0ad29c66">https://www.notion.so/Intro-to-Sutro-raising-the-level-of-ab&hellip;</a>

I don’t believe I’ve ever intro’d myself, so here goes! My winding path:<br/>1. First love was reading &amp; language - hundreds of books while homeschooling (up to 8th grade)<br/>2. Puzzles were my jumping off point into math (which I’d hated). Joined the math team and got shown how to program a TI-83, got hooked on ‘game’ programming. The ease of getting pixels on the screen has haunted me ever since.<br/>3. Undergrad at Penn in bioengineering: not the best choice of major (should have done CS/CompE), but developed appreciation for the resilience/scalability of biological systems compared to mechanized tech, as well as alt forms of computing (e.g. biomolecular logic gates)<br/>4. A bioinspired robotics class followed by a WONDERFUL intro to mechatronics intro’d me to electronics &amp; microcontrollers and connected a bunch of dots. The ability to turn ideas into real devices was heady. <br/>5. Switched to masters in robotics and did a capstone project with very talented partner. Designed a system to connect assistive inputs for people with disabilities to game consoles motivated by observations growing up with my bro. Also led to a neat collab with a rehab robotics lab using gaming for stroke rehab. Decided it was worth trying to make exist in the world &amp; entered the spooky realm of entrepreneurship.<br/>6. Have pretty much nailed the liminal space between success &amp; failure - much progress made, still no product. In the process, discovered Bret Victor, the FoC slack, Alan Kay, etc &amp; have had my mind repeatedly blown while mining computing history. The more I’ve learned, the more I’ve come to see accessibility and FoC as twin issues best tackled as a pair. Finally had some breakthroughs based on an NSF Phase I SBIR grant, &amp; am reformulating the system around proper computing atoms (h/t Alan Kay) vs a glorified config system. Feeling good about our odds if Phase II funding comes through.<br/>My thoughts have crystallized quite a bit over the past few months, and I’m looking forward to good conversations here and progress to report. Feel free to reach out; I enjoy and benefit from verbal sculpting. An emerging primary viewpoint is programming as modeling &amp; simulation (i.e. proper “science”).

<b>What brought me to the future of programming space ...</b><br/><br/>Hi, I am Lukas M Süss (aka mechadense)<br/><br/>I guess for me my path to "future of coding" relevant topics was initially kicked off many years ago (2005 maybe?) when stumbling across a german website with name "C-hater in 10 days".<br/>Before I already had banged my head into the limitations of current day programing languages again and again.<br/>• First in the context of game programming, <br/>• and later in the context of 3D modelling.<br/><b>That was revelation one.</b><br/><em>Here the (german) page in the internetarchive:</em> <br/><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080612103719/http://www.math.uni-bremen.de:80/~thielema/CHater.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20080612103719/http://www.math.u&hellip;</a> )</em> <br/><br/>This eventually led me to taking a course about the haskell programming language and the theory behind it. What I learnd there was quite eye opening and <b>my second revelation.</b><br/>_The (german) course: <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/knoop/fp185A03_ws2122.html">http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/knoop/fp185A03_ws2122.html</a> — by Jens Knoop — at TU Vienna_<br/><br/>At some point when I came across diagramming sofware (then I used yEd) I sketched out all of what I've learned so far. Thereby realizing …<br/>• (A) … how far even Haskell is still improvable. — <b>Revelation three.</b><br/>• (B) … how much can be learned by high level diagramming and how awesome it would be if that would fall out of a programming language<br/>I was starting to desire autopropagarion of renaiming, automatic code substitutions, and more … Desiring structured editing — basically.<br/><br/>My <b>fourth revelation</b> was making the connection between John Tromps Lambda diagrams and textual code, leading to my work on "Annotated Lambda Diagrams (ALDs)".<br/>-- _<a href="http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram">http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram</a>_<br/>I found that translating existing ideas into these diagrams greatly helps me in understanding them. Which makes me think that this may be a good "semitextual" programming interface.<br/>Now I'm in the process of investigating ideas-and-work of some great people in the context of ALDs ( Looking at ideas from: Conal Elliott, Jonathan Edwards, Cryus Omar <a href="http://et.al">et.al</a>. , Daniel P. Friedman, ... ) All this as spare time efforts.<br/><br/>My <b>fifth and so far final revelation</b> (during 2018) emergerd probably mostly from my frustration with nonexistence …<br/>• … of local-first selfhosting options.<br/>• … of personal local-first self-owned content curation assistents.<br/>I realized that in order for good novel technical solutions of core problems to thrive sociotechnical problems need to be solved in unison <em>(unison the word not unison the proglang here)</em>. Code just cannot be borderlessly shared if there are no well designed means that allow for judement of its trustworthyness.<br/>What I want to see eventually are distributed ledgers that:<br/>• do not insist on maximally global public consensus for everything and <br/>• are nonmonetary at their core.<br/>Very few projects aim for that. In fact I only know one so far.<br/><br/>— — —<br/><br/><b>Regarding the "future of coding" side of my interests I'm into:</b> <br/>• denotative core language design<br/>• content adressed design (datastorage and versioning)<br/>• dependent typing <br/>• agent centric design (sociotechnical aspect)<br/>• and what I missed here ...<br/>My core interest though is actually advanced atomically precise manufacturing (APM). Aimed at future gemstome-metamaterial-on-chip-factories. But if software does not get fixed I see a dark future ahead. Both for the path there and the eventual result.

Howdy folks - I'm Malte, founder of utopia (<a href="http://utopia.app">utopia.app</a>), and former/future dabbler in visual scripting systems, real-time feedback loops and such. I'm here because... I feel like Minecraft is a better creator UI than most creator UIs? A decade after Bret Victor wrote his influential posts we still haven't seen what that can look like in a mass market product - and probably for good reason, if only someone knew what those are? So, basically, to learn and discuss with curious folks smarter than me :slightly_smiling_face:

Hello fellow humans! Mattia here.<br/>I am Product Designer based in Sydney, Australia.<br/><br/>I landed here following a Bret Victor trail (and browsing around I am sensing some good Kay, Mead, Lakoff, Piaget, Mitchell, Hofstadter vibes). People in this community have been a massive source of joy for me. I hope to continue to learn from everyone, and to one day be able to make meaningful contributions.<br/>I say “one day” because I am yet unable to do things with code other than styling (html css sass) or - the horror! - hacking spreadsheets (for example <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1629UXZ07lVK1-LVR0T7u1RDVKeW4f55K688CAtS5maw/edit?usp=sharing">this Cellular Automata one</a>).

Hello All, I’ve been following FoC podcast and know Steve K. for some time. I focus on computing as a medium of thought and related topic. This takes me to thinking about systems, interfaces, languages, and general human focused directions within the world of technology. In the past I’ve built many things, worked in many different arrangements, and my educational background is in math. I keep <a href="https://danielkrasner.com/">https://danielkrasner.com/</a> reasonably up to date but you can always ask me directly. Speak soon, Daniel

Hi, my name is Jamshid and I am from Afghanistan, living in Vancouver, Canada. I am a Software Developer, running a software development startup with 15 developers locally resident in Afghanistan. Since the past 7 years, I am also running CodeWeekend, Afghanistan’s first and largest developers community. We are currently planning for next cohort of our Coding Bootcamp for Afghan youth both inside Afghanistan and outside Afghanistan (specially recent refugees). It is a great pleasure to be here in this community.

Hi! I've been told about this community as a place where one can present some early stage ideas to like-minded people aware of the drastic changes that the landscape of programming systems is undergoing.<br/><br/>During my graduate studies I did research in the fields of both theoretical Constraint Programming and End User Development, although now I only do it as a personal side project.  I devoured the now classics "Watch what I do" and "Your wish is my command", as well as all the UX books I could find and anything design-related in a wide sense. I'm a believer that the Cognive Dimensions framework of TRG Green et. al. has potential for its intended use as a meta-language for exploring software design and pivoting it in unusual directions, though that may be over-confidence on my understanding of it. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>I certainly have ideas that I would like to develop into a coherent explanation, on how to create a system for information workers who want to build their own data processing workflows without constant assistance from software engineers. I've seen the venerable copy/paste being used for gluing disparate tools into personal workflows through lots of back-and-forth manual data transfers; I've even seen this copy/paste protocol upgraded from humble raw text to rich text, supporting style and multimedia objects. And I have insights for a new upgrade that provides the protocol with structured data and persistent semi-automated workflows, building the mythical "unix pipes for visual user interfaces" that we were promised decades ago.<br/><br/>I have seen many signs that the computing field is converging towards a form of computation with novel aspects reappearing in different contexts, where many of my ideas about modern computation appear incomplete in various systems, with no single one containing all of them. I would love to explore what expectations people have about modern knowledge-processing devices, and whether my insights could be used to support those expectations and improve their users work. I hope this community will help me grow in knoledge.

Hello I found this community through YouTube rabbit-holes and research dives across google which lead me to a talk on the dion systems by allen webster and ryan fluery because I am researching interesting and new ways of representing ideas and thoughts into code or anything machine readable.<br/>I am very much interested in the ideas around language design and rethinking how software engineering is done. It seems as though people have forgotten that computers are simply tools that we manipulate to solve problems for us.<br/>Having more interesting ways to represents ideas and thoughts allows for more interesting solutions and a more intuitive separation of work amongst dev teams.<br/>I m curious about representing in formal mathematical definitions and implementing (and challenging) this definitions in code, essentially making PLs a translation of formal ideas of thought.<br/><br/>P. S. I m pretty young and still studying and hoping to complete my degree next year and start my masters, I hope my questions and lack of in-depth knowledge won't become a hinderance

Hey folks! Just found this community from a post on a Discord about low profile keyboard. My name is Kiril and I live in Stockholm, Sweden. I like developer tools, build systems, programming languages and combinatorics / optimisation. I have worked / toyed with Go, Rust, Clojure, Bazel build, making custom keyboards.<br/><br/>Not too long ago I worked at a company called Tink, focused on developer tools - making build times faster (cache-able, remote etc) locally and in CI. In general, making creating a tighter feedback loop for developers.<br/><br/>This year I co-founded a company with the goal of making the developer life better. It is somewhat unpopular to question Git but we wanted to explore and experiment with development workflows that are not constrained by it. You can check out  and try what we have so far here <a href="https://getsturdy.com/">https://getsturdy.com/</a>

Hey all, I'm Abdiel Lopez, you can call me Del (since its the only nickname anyone can come up with). I help consume food, and make courses on CS and Gamedev in my spare time.<br/><br/>I am passionate about the possibilities and future tech that has yet to be tested in the gamedev area. I found that through teaching I could advance the future of software faster than if I just tried to make that future myself.

Hey guys, I'm Vlad, glad to join the community. I live in Basel, Switzerland and run a software company. I've programmed most of my life, and since I've mentored many programmers, I've seen first-hand how bewildering and overly complex modern programming can be. My main focus right now is learning anything and everything that can help me contribute towards a better future for programming.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm working on the Peony game engine, a 3D game engine written from scratch in C++: <a href="https://vladh.net/peony">https://vladh.net/peony</a><br/><br/>You can read some of my thoughts on programming here: <a href="https://vladh.net/manifesto">https://vladh.net/manifesto</a><br/><br/>Lastly, I'd be extremely happy to chat with more like-minded people, so I'm looking forward to talking to you guys. If you find what I'm doing even mildly interesting, feel free to DM me, I'm always open for a chat.

Hey all, my name is Sam.  Glad to join this community.<br/><br/>I freelance part-time, and spend most of my days working on what seems most important, for better future outcomes and better futures we'll all experience.<br/><br/>That often includes digital things, based on the collaborative potential that the Internet enables — as well as the risks / downsides / opportunity costs, of the attention economy and big tech.<br/><br/>On that note, here are two concepts I've been reflecting on for some time, and I would love to explore with the FOC community:<br/><br/><b>1</b>. <b>A substrate for communication, collaboration, and coordination — built on our existing social graphs.</b><br/><br/>I've started using LinkedIn as a way to communicate above the walled garden chat communities.<br/><br/>I'm doing this to enable discoverability + accessibility + knowledge-sharing with my work.  Much of the professional world — at least in subject areas I'm focused on — is on LinkedIn.  By posting content and having discussions there, it enables anybody who may be interested in what I'm working on it to discover it — and likewise, me to discover them.<br/><br/>For this use case, and many others, it seems uncontroversial that we'll move away from centralized social networks — to networks that are more free, user-centric,  and dynamic.<br/><br/>To start this transition, it seems that the simplest and surest first step is having access to our <b>graph data</b> — so that we can <b>use it</b> and <b>build/experiment on it</b>.<br/><br/>Specifically, I'm talking about:<br/><br/>1. Export my contacts from LinkedIn, Facebook, and other social networks, using their APIs<br/>2. Import those contacts into a new substrate/protocol, with some simple structure to help with identification.  (For example, to tell the difference between two contacts named "Bret Victor."  Or, if each of us have a "Bret Victor" in our contacts, an intelligent way to recognize if they are or are not the same person.  Email or phone number could be a useful "anchor" for this — and better approaches could certainly be possible as well. )<br/>3. Once I have all of my contacts accessible — I just want some simple functionality to <b>send messages</b>, and the ability to <b>tinker/experiment with new ways of interacting</b> on top of this new substrate.<br/>Part 1 is feasible today.  Part 2 seems like it requires some dedicated thought and design.  Part 3 only comes after Part 1, and along with Part 2.<br/><br/>If anybody is interested in this type of thing, I'd love to hear thoughts and collaborate.  Note that this approach isn't about onboarding to a new network, it's about migrating our existing networks to a new and dynamic environment.  Also this is envisioned more of a commons / protocol initiative, not as a new network itself.<br/><br/>2. <b>A better browser — for embodied browsing, better bookmarking and tabs, configurable interfaces and websites, etc.</b><br/><br/>• A tool to use <a href="https://github.com/midiblocks/handsfree">face / hand / motion tracking in front-ends and browsers</a><br/>• New browser capabilities like <a href="https://vivaldi.com/">tab management</a>, privacy, custom macros, auto quitting tab processes when memory runs high<br/>• Social bookmarking / knowledge management<br/>• <a href="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/">Modifying website interfaces</a><br/>I want an open-source browser that starts pulling some of things capabilities together, makes them available, and enables us to keep building on top.<br/><br/>I want the embodied browsing experience of pulling my hand down through the air, like Luke Skywalker setting down the X-Wing on Dagobah, to scroll down on articles and feeds — turning computer time into embodied, physical activity.<br/><br/>When I have shit tons of tabs open, I want my browser to automatically quit the process of the oldest tabs — not x-ing them out, but just freeing up the memory — so I don't have to do that myself.<br/><br/>I want to experiment with social bookmarking, and I don't want to depend on an extension or a SaaS product to do it.<br/><br/>I want to be able to modify website interfaces — and have those preferences / customizations saved, for whenever I return.<br/><br/>I want to be able to experiment with digital virtual assistants and building my own automated processes — e.g. for specific websites as well.<br/><br/>There could be limitless other possibilities too — especially if the browser is open-source and configurable.<br/><br/>It seems like a lot of the tooling for this is already built out, either in extensions or in experimental GitHub repos.  I am very okay with hacky and experimental.<br/><br/>I just want to start putting this together and start experimenting / building / seeing if there is anything viable here.  I've never worked with browser software, and I'm not going to embark on that journey solo I don't think — so if anybody else wants these types of capabilities too, let's explore making them!

:wave:  Hi folks. Surprised I didn’t find this community sooner, but glad this is a thing!<br/><br/>I’m an art director, designer, and mediocre dev in London. Currently working at <a href="http://egghead.io">egghead.io</a> (web dev educational platform) where I spend a lot of time designing and illustrating metaphors for programming concepts. Also helped co-create a book that uses visual diagrams to explain javascript: <a href="http://justjavascript.com">justjavascript.com</a>. That project sent me down the rabbit hole of researching visual programming languages and alternate programming mediums. I was already a Victor/Kay/Engelbart/Xanadu obsessive, so it all comes full circle.<br/><br/>I’m also a cultural anthropologist by training, and headed in an MSc in digital anthropology at UCL. Interested in the cultural dynamics of programming communities – specifically JavaScript-land since that’s where I tend to hang out. Glad to have found this corner of the web and always up for a chat with folks interested in the same topics.

TIL and it feels like a good place. I make a podcast about Clojure (defn) and have a panel based YouTube channel about coding in Clojure (apropos clojure). My hope for the future was rekindled after I first saw Brett Victor's talk Inventing on Principle. I am in the midst of a project (repl-repl) to perform collaborative live coding in Clojure ... it had stalled for a while but various things have pushed me back into action, including the work that NextJournal have done with CodeMirror v6. I am interested in the mechanics of programming as you can tell but also the effect of programming on the society at large. I don't know if this is the right place to have these conversations but I'm here for it if it is.

:wave: Hey folks! A friend pointed me towards this community a few months ago and I've been lurking since! Have slowly been making my way through some of the content (Whole Code Catalog and related) and still can't believe how much amazing stuff you all have gathered here. SO cool that this community exists! :sparkles:<br/><br/>Similarly to what I've seen in a couple of other introductions, I got hooked on the vision of a much better future after watching Inventing on Principle by Bret Victor. Spent some time investigating the space of "mobile apps for software engineers" for my bachelor thesis. Then worked at GitHub for a couple of years, mostly on and around the GitHub platform/API. Left that job to focus full time on building the <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Simple Poll</span> Slack app (which remains my primary income source but has little to do with the future of coding).<br/><br/>Over the past year I've been thinking a lot about how to make software engineering much much faster. This culminated in me building <a href="https://kolo.app">Kolo</a> which brings some liveness/runtime inspection/visualisation to Django + VSCode. Kolo launched two weeks ago in alpha, so definitely still under heavy development and I'm taking in all the feedback I can. Hoping to contribute to the  #two-minute-week channel on occasion! :crossed_fingers:Oh and I’m based in London! :gb:

Hey all!<br/>I'll preface all of this by saying I'm more of a futuristic coding enthusiast than an active researcher – I like listening to the podcast, I very much enjoy learning about different approaches to code, but at the end of the day, most if not all of my coding happens in regular old imperative textual languages.<br/><br/>That all said, my day job is not <em>entirely</em> unrelated (NDAs suck...), and I like to believe my combination of academic, professional and hobby interests should let me contribute some thoughts :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>I did implement a behavior tree based "mission control" system (think <a href="http://philserver.bplaced.net/fbe/">http://philserver.bplaced.net/fbe/</a>, but with behavior trees instead of statecharts) for my Master's Thesis, with some (sort of) unique tweaks particularly w.r.t. handling data and long-running actions – happy to share the PDF if anyone's interested.<br/><br/>Aside from that, some of my interests are:<br/>• Hardware design (both circuits and chips, i.e. VHDL/Verilog) + low-level embedded (up to and including cycle counting) software<br/>• Music/Rhythm games (think DDR or Rock Band), and the unconventional user interfaces that go along with those<br/>• Niche programming languages (I at one point wrote an APL program, and started learning some Forth, to give you a taste)

Hi all, I'm a biologist-turned-developer working on code experiments exploring how to help users create and reuse process documentation as they create narratives, notes, and files. Broadly I am interested in understanding how to apply the best practices and automation we take for granted when writing code in IDEs to the way people write semi-structured instructions intended to be "executed" not by computers but by other humans. I'm "100ideas" on most online platforms. See you around!

Hello all. I'm an assistant professor at UCF whose research primarily concerns platforms and immersive media. I co-authored a book on the Flash platform (<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/flash">https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/flash</a>) and on adventure games (<a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/adventure-games-9781501346545/">https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/adventure-games-9781501346545/</a>) and am currently working on an experimental real-time collaborative environment for authoring immersive media content and behavior. I'm very interested in broadening participation and furthering our knowledge of how to match interest, engagement and humanity with computing, and am interested in finding others who share those values. I came here by way of Eve, Codestrates, and have worked briefly with Ted Nelson and am a fan of Bret Victor's work.

Hey there! I study math, physics, and compsci independently. My interests focus on the (shared!) foundations of math, physics, and language. I want to develop computationally-rich environments where communities can gather and transmute their collective knowledge and catalyze discovery, learning, and teaching.<br/><br/>I am also interested in programming language design. I am very interested in dependent type theory, homotopy theory, higher categories, and how these ideas will influence the future of computing on increasingly-varied material substrates. To this end, I am trying to reimagine the entire information architecture, from MOSFET microarchitecture all the way up the abstraction layers. To this end, I want to extend the idea of formal structure (especially as implemented in category theory and functional programming languages) to include "formal substance", and to leverage the understanding which this affords to make more efficient metamaterial substrates for the observation and control of information flow, generally.<br/><br/>I got into math to learn physics, and then I got into computer science when I learned that my category theory knowledge should overlap significantly with the functional programming paradigm. I am currently reading SICP and learning Scheme, taking a break from Haskell so that I can better understand compiler and interpreter design. I'd like to push high-level interpretation further down in abstraction, and to find how information flow relates fundamentally to the shapes of our programs as physical control processes.

Hi all. I'm a mathematician and computer languages enthusiast, interested in topics going from formal proofs, user interfaces for editing technical documents, manageable and open source software engineering, high-quality computer typography. I'm part of a group of people developing the free scientific editing platform TeXmacs (<a href="http://www.texmacs.org">www.texmacs.org</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gnu_texmacs">https://twitter.com/gnu_texmacs</a>) which is a complete solution for scientific document preparation and reproducible science including interactive sessions with external software. I'm here to look for possible collaborations/interactions with other projects which look forward into the evolution of our way to use computers to express, develop and publish ideas.

Hi! I'm Jan, I'm about to begin my studies of mathematics, and I've always been keen on programming and more recently on an "upgraded version" thereof. I've come to discover this community through my readings of Alan Kay's ideas, and especially the Whole Code Catalog has amazed me.<br/><br/>During the past year, I've read much about synchronization in distributed systems, symbolic AI (the work of William Byrd and others has blown my mind) and much more, and I've been thinking about general human-computer interaction, especially in the realm of programming. My dream project is an environment for a hybrid textual-graphical language, in which one wouldn't generally write text, but rather compose entities that would both <em>have</em> behaviour (in regards to development) and <em>signify</em> behaviour (in regards to the end-product).<br/><br/>Right now, I'm finalizing my final <a href="https://github.com/ruza-net/eru">high school project</a> which entails the development of a library of trace-like versioned container types. These are designed for distributed systems, since they are CRDTs. I also plan a small declarative language that uses genetic algorithms to synthesise implementation fitting a type declaration together with a test suite. I'm also interested in (homotopy) type theory, and I'm exploring the problem of constructing simplicial types inside it (recently, I started thinking about speculative typing).<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm looking forward to discussing any ideas about the future of programming (and generally computer science).

Hello Everyone! My name is Keith and I'm a computer scientist and member of the <a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/">Wolfram Physics Project</a>! I'm currently researching in creating science for the "Game of Life" !!! I'm quite excited to talk with some of you guys, heterodox programmers !!! I found the podcast Future of programming because I listened to Devine Lu Linvega at a conference at MILA(Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms) Montréal. I'm quite interested in researching the creativity of computer programmers and I'm currently doing it with the 50 years of Game of Life development  !!

Hi! I’m Florian and I’m super grateful for the Future of Coding Podcast that I’ve been subscribing to for the past years. I’ve recently stumbled upon the Whole Code Catalog which made me so happy to see and get lost in it. Thank you so much!<br/><br/>Learning about the history was key when studying Interface Design. While following all the new things with design and development today, I’ve always found much more joy discovering what has been done already.<br/><br/>I’ve been developing tons of plugins for Sketch in the past up to the point that I’ve started developing my own design tool called “Ratio”.<br/><br/>After tons of prototypes, cycles and distractions, I’m currently returning to my original <b>mission of making programming part of a designer’s toolbox</b> and to build a tool that can be used by designers and web developers alike. <a href="https://useratio.com">https://useratio.com</a>

Hi everyone :wave: I’m Ben, I work at <a href="http://HASH.ai">HASH.ai</a> where we’re building an open source platform for multi agent simulations. I’ve been lurking for a little while - since <span style="background-color:#ccf">@breck7</span> mentioned it to me (thanks!)  - as I’m really interested in the question of how we can build richer programming environments and better interfaces to those environments. I’m also quite interested in forecasting and collective intelligence. I'm looking forward to participating in the conversation!

Hey everyone! I’m Gustav and I’ve been working in the developer tooling/productivity space for a few years now, previously at a large fintech for a few years and now I’m a co-founder of a YC company in the same space. I’ve been working a lot with monorepos and compiler toolchains in Bazel, and have been building a lot of tools to get 100s of developers to work better and faster together. On my spare time I’m building compilers, static code analysers, and running quite a lot. It’s nice to meet you all! :smiley:

Hello! I'm Braden. Trained as a biomedical engineer and spent my career developing medical devices. I'm currently an innovation fellow at the Medical Device Center at the University of Minnesota. It's a year-long leadership program to find an unmet medical problem and come up with a new device to address it. I'm was referred to the FoC slack from the Julia Discourse forum.<br/><br/>My main interest is accelerating the rate at which we (everyone) develop products. The frustrating reality for many product designers is solving a problem that has been solved before ... but the solution is inaccessible (paywalls, trade secrets, lost, forgotten, poorly documented). Some people shrug and say "that's just the way it works." I see this as an avoidable waste of the time and energy of <b>many</b> engineers, scientists, and designers. I think programming is a key element to addressing this problem.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Molham Aref</span>, I enjoyed your talk at JuliaCon 2020. I met a few people from relationalAI for beers ages ago, and it seems like you've curated an incredibly talented team.

Hi everyone! I am a developer, currently at Epic Games. My interest in development tools started with making 4coder, a text editor (that I still use now!). In the course of that project I realized I couldn't achieve most of the things I would want to because of the limits of the text-file-centric paradigm. Last year I started exploring how to build something outside of that paradigm with a small team and in my research I discovered the FoC community. I've been lurking on the edges since then. I'm interested to see more of what other people out there are doing.

Thirty-one years ago I had an idea about the future of coding, and since then I've directed my education, research and career towards realizing that vision. I've studied programming languages, compilers, modelling, knowledge representation, design patterns, functional programming, operating-systems, data-structures, and any other subject which I thought would contribute towards my goal. The current manifestation of this idea is called FOAM, the Feature-Oriented Active Modeller (see: <a href="http://foamdev.com">foamdev.com</a>). A short video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4LbUv5FsGQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4LbUv5FsGQ</a> and a long one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsFLlgrzn2E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsFLlgrzn2E</a>.  Besides that, I enjoy 3d printing, camping, playing go, slingshotting, and I coach track &amp; field (pole vault).

Hello all, I’m a YC founder and serial entrepreneur. My prior 3 companies have all had something to do with the future of work in general, so I’ve taken those learnings over the last 20+ years and tried to apply it to improving developer collaboration with my latest startup. I’m also a hobbyist woodworker and recently completed a two-story treehouse in our back yard with the help of my family; mostly my wife and now-16-year-old son.

Hi all, I’m a YC founder and former Opendoor engineering manager. I’ve been thinking about the next wave of no-code interfaces – so far we’ve got connectors, databases, and interface builders. what about data engineering? EDA, ETL, DWH – as best practices for data and data stacks stabilize, the next step will be automation and abstraction. One such tool I’m thinking about is a Jupyter notebook with spreadsheet formulas rather than Python. Reach out if interested in chatting!

Hello, my name is Yusuke Shinyama. I'm interested in program comprehension and education. I'm currently teaching introductory CS (Python) and AI/ML exercises at Tokyo Institute of Technology. Originally I've studied (and had a PhD on) Natural Language Processing, but eventually got bored of it so I moved into Software Engineering. Why? I've always been interested in studying the meaning of a language, but found out that so many NLP researchers are afraid of even using the word "meaning" because it's such a loaded word there! I assumed that the meaning in software world was a bit better defined... only to find out that the meaning of functions and identifiers are still very murky area here. Still, I hope to bring some of the insights I've got in NLP to the SE field. For now, I'm mainly working on a program comprehension of a large project. I also worked on developing assistive tools for blind people, and am interested in accessibility tools for blind programmers. My hobby is developing game engines and open source tools (<a href="https://github.com/euske">https://github.com/euske</a>). This community looks fun and I'm grateful to be here. Cheers!<br/>Edit: typo on my university name - oops.

Hey there, I’m Dane Filipczak my background is in music technology and functional programming. I’m located in Seattle, and found this community through researching project Eve. I’m working on making a new environment for music composition that includes computation and expressive transformation as a first class citizen, to replace the extremely static and usually frustratingly inexpressive world of MIDI-based DAWs and traditional notation editors. Looking forward to expanding my horizons and learning from what others are attempting in similar areas. Nice to meet you!

Hello everyone!<br/><br/>I'm Pablo, a first-year French PhD student based in Paris. I have a background in theoretical comp-sci, more specifically in logic, proof theory, and programming language theory. I'm doing my thesis under the supervision of Benjamin Werner, who already introduced himself in this channel yesterday :)<br/><br/>I have been following the FoC podcasts and weekly newsletter for almost two years, and always found the discussions and findings of the community very enlightening and motivating. There is such a feeling of validation when you discover that there is a whole community of like-minded people, who share similar vision and core values in the way they dream about the future of computing ^^<br/><br/>My long-term ambition is to help bringing together centuries of deep philosophical and mathematical knowledge about logic, and decades of experimentations and insights in the design of ergonomic human-computer interfaces. The ultimate goal being to build a solid foundation for a renewed science of programming, that focuses more on the human and social aspects of systems building. Yes, I might be too big of a dreamer, even for the FoC community :sweat_smile:<br/><br/>To conclude this lengthy introduction on a more concrete note: we are currently working with Benjamin and collaborators on the design of a new kind of graphical interface for proof assistants, based on the direct manipulation of mathematical objects and formulas. We may soon be able to share a very early version of our web-based prototype. We will then be eager to get feedback and insights from the FoC community! As a little teaser, I recently discovered that there may be a formal <em>Curry-Howard correspondence</em> between our work, and the one of Conal Elliott on tangible functional programming... Stay tuned for more info!

Hi, I’m Rob Haisfield. I’m a behavioral product strategy and gamification consultant, as well as a behavioral product strategist at <a href="https://www.sparkwave.tech/">Spark Wave</a>. Basically that means that I think about how to influence user behavior such that people gain more value out of the apps that they use.<br/><br/>I’m largely in this group due to my work on the onboarding for GuidedTrack, a domain-specific language for interconnected form building --&gt; web applications. Since working with them, I’ve become fascinated with powerful horizontal products with a smooth learning curve from beginner to power user, and domain-specific languages feel like the next natural step. There’s a lot that could be done to make DSLs learnable, even as replacements for full-blown apps, and I want to help make that happen!<br/><br/>You can find some of my work for GuidedTrack here:<br/><br/><a href="https://robhaisfield.com/notes/guidedtrack">https://robhaisfield.com/notes/guidedtrack</a><br/><br/>And if you want to skip ahead a bit for the full onboarding plan I presented them: <a href="https://robhaisfield.com/notes/onboarding-plan-as-presented-to-guidedtrack-on-10-20-20">https://robhaisfield.com/notes/onboarding-plan-as-presented-&hellip;</a>

Hi!  I’m Mark, and for the past two and a half years I’ve been working on a commercial product to make software development dramatically easier.  After working many years on programming languages and developer tools I’ve become more and more disenchanted with the current state of affairs.  Building even simple apps seems to have become not easier over the past few decades, but harder.  Spreadsheets, the most successful end-user programming tool, is stuck with a UI that makes it almost impossible to deliver nice apps.  That’s one of the amazing but also frustrating thing about them: they’re the programming environment as well as the app you’re building rolled into one.  So one of the ways to think about what my team and I are building is a spreadsheety database at the base that a configurable frontend at the top.  I’m here to learn about people’s ideas and brainstorm.  Thank you so much for having me!

Hi! I’m Ketan, and I’m mostly just here to lurk and take a glimpse into the future :) I’m currently a student, and one thing I’m interested in is embodied cognition as it applies to programming. I made a “<a href="https://github.com/ketan0/smart-glove">smart glove</a>,” and currently it helps me switch tools easily when drawing on my iPad, but I’m also wondering how I could use it to help me program. I’m also enthusiastic about emacs + org-mode (mixing code blocks from different languages!), and I am tinkering with a couple cute emacs-lisp packages for integrating twitter threads and spotify playlists into org-mode.

Hi everyone. I’m Francois. Here’s what I’m working towards. It is called Gooey. I'm going to blather a bit here, to see if any of my background is interesting for context.<br/><br/>My background is in making design/dev tools, platforms, and of course just making experiences. I was a game developer for the first 10 years of my career and then went on a decade run of doing startups.  I work at Bose having done Applied Research in the XR/tools space for the last 3 years and now am being promoted into running all Software Incubation within our investment arm. Lately I've been more seriously experimenting and discussing getting funding to start a company around this space. <br/><br/>I can't share too much just yet, until I either get a legal waver from Bose Legal, and finish some discussions on potentially spinning out from Bose. I want to work on this no strings attached though.<br/><br/>Gooey's rough description and direction is: using game engine/editor technology but applied to refining and communication concepts to others. I'm a fan of a tool that is browser first and am pursuing that approach. I think highly baked in social features is extremely important. Figuring out how to make securely re-mixable components that will have access to often personal or professional data is top of mind. Other things I'm interested in:<br/>How do you make interactive design code/assets that will still be runnable/loadable/useful in a decade (not be dependent on likely to go away environments like APIs)<br/>Figuring out which is more optimal: being the whole runtime/IDE stack, being a more clean embedded runtime, or being more of a file-format/protocol.<br/>Is there a conflict between learnable and powerful? <br/>Creators can easily make an ecosystem of hard to understand building blocks and processes, is there something that can be done to help grow a culture of caring about crafting good remixable components such as static analysis or badges/scores marked by each component? <br/>Should I make a new programming language or try to tame existing languages with some editor enforced invariant enforcement? <br/>Ensuring components are say functionally pure, or a DAG, and/or deterministic for instance can lead to some serious optimizations, cleaner implementation, and I think learnability.<br/>I'm a fan of for instance what Observable is doing where you can write Javascript with a minor language change or two, but it's difficult to not make your code reactive by default.<br/>I'll stop there, I've thought about this for almost 15 years, so I could talk forever.<br/><br/>I'd like to build a sustainable/high-profitable company so I can have a healthy amount of funding to pursue necessary research with smart collaborators. I'm struggling with how to balance wanting to make something open source. I'd say I really like Figma's approach of just making something awesome people want to pay for, being a relatively open company sharing their design thinking, and of course I think the CTO making cool shit for the community (such as in esbuild). This makes me feel like Figma gives back to the community. Of course there is plenty of space for a magnitude more of giving back and being transparent, which is where I'd hope to fall. It's all easier said than done to make sure you aren't a starving idealist/artist.<br/><br/>My favorite company overall though (and I find this funny, after all of the hate I had when they were trying to kill the browser) is Microsoft in terms of vision for enabling developers both profitably and in giving back a lot with awesome open source projects. Github is in my opinion, the most well designed product ever.<br/>

Greetings from Gothenburg, Sweden! I started coding in Amiga Basic as a 10-year old, and professionally since 2000, mostly web, C++ and graphics. Although I always loved programming, I also always strongly felt that there has to be a better way than the status quo. Frustratingly, my teachers, colleagues &amp; peers didn't seem to care. When I finally found Bret Victor's work, it felt like a huge validation - "I'm not alone, I'm not crazy, someone else gets it too!"<br/><br/>Consumed the Future of Coding site in "read-only mode" for years (thanks for the great content, Steve!), but I didn't join the community in read-write mode until now that I have something substantial to contribute - coming soon in the #share-your-work channel.<br/><br/>Interested in everything, but with a special focus on:<br/><li> Visualization - as in revealing the shape and size of abstract things clearly, <em>not</em> just giving bar charts a sci-fi look<br/><li> User interface design - really unhappy with current mainstream trends, UIs ought to empower users rather than dumbing things down<br/><li> Pipe dreaming of redesigning OSes, the internet and the web stack from scratch with the benefit of hindsight<br/><li> ... but also charting realistic incremental improvements<br/><li> Green/environmental issues - neither hardware nor CPU cycles are free, make sure they carry their weight

Hi everyone! I’m Katie, a software engineer from Sydney, Australia. I got introduced to this community because someone shared a video of my talk here (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UH0A2iujtY8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UH0A2iujtY8</a>) about the building a visual programming interface (it’s not about Scratch as the thumbnail would have you believe), and a few people reached out to me from that! It’s awesome to find so many like-minded people who are working on cool things. :grin:

:wave: Hi All! My name’s Josh, and I’ve been based in San Francisco for the past seven years. I recently co-founded a company called Outline where we’re building tools for customer-facing teams.  I enjoy functional programming and spend my days using Elixir, although I dabble with Haskell and Clojure (big fan of Rich Hickey).<br/>Really excited to have discovered this community, would love to connect over a virtual coffee to chat programming language concepts, startups, and anything in between!

Hello. My name’s Sam and I’m from Columbus, Ohio. I’m a software engineer mainly working in binary analysis.<br/><br/>I just found this group through a 100r podcast about making your own tools and I had to see what its all about.<br/><br/>I enjoy all facets of computing but I mainly find myself reverse engineering these days. I’m currently working on reverse engineering the Wacom tablet driver to create my own (I know these already exist but I enjoy going through the process myself).<br/><br/>I’m looking forward to exploring this community and hopefully meeting like-minded people. Cheers.

:wave: Hello! I'm Tim. I'm very interested in how developing software systems will evolve and look in the future (surprise!).  I'm especially interested in:<br/>• modeling the entire software system in a first class way<br/>• capturing the entire SDLC in a first class way (especially changes - we write software to change it but I don't see many PLs modeling change)<br/>• nocode/full code hybridizations<br/>• leveraging existing ecosystems and avoiding a boil the ocean approach<br/>If you share any of these interests, I'd love to chat!

Hi all! I've been leeching here for a bit, but never properly introduced myself :face_with_hand_over_mouth:..<br/><br/>I'm Yousef, from Amsterdam, and lifelong programmer + startup. If there are any outdoor enthusiast here you might be familiar with Relive, a startup I cofounded and most successful project so far (app with 10M+ users).<br/><br/>Like many of you here I've always been interested in programming environments, probably triggered by Bret Victor  a long time ago :male_mage:.<br/><br/>Currently, I'm experimenting with a Reactive Live Programming environment, with support for TypeScript, React, NPM / esm modules. I hope to make this an open source project and to share this with you soon.<br/><br/>For now, I've recorded a first demo @ <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/9f9f91a10348478f9bb0300220452b10">https://www.loom.com/share/9f9f91a10348478f9bb0300220452b10</a>. Would be really cool to hear your feedback, and looking forward to being an active member of this community!

Hello! Most of my career has seen me working in a visual programming language, namely LabVIEW. Because of this experience, when I move to my other favorite languages like F# or Racket, it feels like 2 steps forward and 3 steps backwards, primarily when it comes to being able to debugging and especially while the program is running. I am inspired by visual languages like vvvv, Pure Data, and TouchDesigner, and I am convinced that the future of programming is a hybrid approach, where there is tight integration but blurred lines between what is textually and visually specified. I am learning Pure Data and vvvv at the moment, and still have it on my plate to learn Touch Designer and Pharo, all the while I am working on designing my own language while also learning how to generally do so. :) The trouble is I'm not the smartest tool in the shed, so progress is slow but becoming tangible.

Hi, I very sorry if it's off-topic but I wrote a post about my mental health, and am trying to raise awareness. I hope it could be useful for at least somebody. I'm trying to promote in HN as well: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25714408">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25714408</a><br/>please consider upvoting, if more people read it, I would feel like it's all not in vain.

Hello all ! <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tomas Petricek</span> directed me here, thank you Tomas !<br/>My current job, which I've been doing for just under 20 years, involves using a mixture of C++, python, and various shader languages (GLSL, HLSL, DirectX compute et al), that runs on clusters of CPU+GPU machines. Over the years I've become increasingly frustrated with the (continually worsening) complexity and poor productivity of the tools we use to write such applications, so I decided to do something about it.<br/>For the last year, I've been working on a side-project called 'zero' - a programming language (and tool-chain) to let me write efficient, compiled, type-checked code that runs on the CPU and GPU, distributes across clusters naturally, but also gives me a proper live-coding workflow. Not a big ask, obviously :sweat_smile:<br/>I've got to the stage where I finally have a reference interpreter that lets me experiment with language ideas and workflows, and I'm about to start work on the full-on compiler. I'm in the fortunate position of being able shortly to transition to working on the language full-time, with a target of starting a new company in early 2022.<br/>Since I have an engineering rather than an academic background, I have a lot of learning to do - I definitely need some mentorship, guidance, critique, encouragement and moral support. Hopefully I can also be of some use to others as well !

Hi folks! :wave: I'm delighted that a long chain of links from papers on visualisation and visual programming languages finally led me to discover this community.<br/><br/>I'm enthusiastic about making systems programming more accessible and explorable. In particular, my goal is to bring more people into the Rust community and I'm working on applying some of the Bret Victor's and Papert's ideas in <a href="https://lowlvl.org">Low-Level Academy</a>, which is intended to be a free &amp; open resource to learn about things like networking, operating systems, or virtual memory in an interactive and project-based fashion.<br/><br/>I'm also exploring ideas about making <a href="https://docs.rs/std">Rust documentation</a> easier to understand, thinking about how to bring collaboration &amp; sharing into the interactive playgrounds, how to make them a11y-friendly, and about how to find time to work on all this stuff. :smile:

Hello Channel,<br/><br/>I am Shubhadeep. Indian by birth and presently living in Paris (moving to India in Feb 2021). I have been working as CTO of Codist for the last one year and half (EF pre-seed funded). We have been working on Machine Learning on Source Code and built amazing open source products including docly (Auto document your python code), tree-hugger (Universal Source Code mining platform), CodeBERT (a transformer model, pre-trained on code corpus).<br/><br/>Before that I have been working on Very Large Scale data Engineering and Machine Learning in Companies such as Kpler (Paris), Ubble (Paris), Mammoth Analytics (SF/Bangalore), Experience Commerce (presently part of Samsung) etc.<br/><br/>I have really wide range of experience and expertise. Some of them<br/><br/>- Vast ML and DL skills including clear understanding about the theory behind (Created product from scratch which is Open Source and used by more than 500 active users in less than three months)<br/>- Data Engineering (Beam, Spark, Kafka, AWS, GCP, Elasticsearch)<br/>- Dev-ops (Docker, K8S, ECS, Ansible)<br/>- Programming Language (Python, Go, C++, Rust, Javascript)<br/>- REST API, Scrapping, Architecture Design<br/>- Building and maintaining a team, mentoring them<br/>- Internationally published author in Data Science <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/data-wrangling-with-python/9781789800111">https://www.packtpub.com/product/data-wrangling-with-python/9781789800111</a><br/>- Highly popular tech blogger - <a href="https://medium.com/@rcshubha">https://medium.com/@rcshubha</a><br/><br/>Some of my profiles / Other online presence -<br/><br/>Github - <a href="https://github.com/rcshubhadeep">https://github.com/rcshubhadeep</a><br/>Stackoverflow - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1587118/src#">https://stackoverflow.com/users/1587118/src#</a><br/>Linkedin - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubhadeep-roychowdhury/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubhadeep-roychowdhury/</a><br/>Youtube - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d-w3cx2TlU&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d-w3cx2TlU&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> (my talk on Machine Learning on Source Code in a very popular DS channel)<br/><br/>What am Looking for? -<br/><br/>With a heavy heart I have to bid goodbye to Codist. We did all we could. But despite being good engineers / scientists, we were not good sellers. So at the end we accepted the reality that we are out of money and no-one is yet ready to invest (Oh you, God d**n COVID!). So, I am looking to get a suitable senior position (CTO, Lead Data Scientist, Senior ML Engineer etc.)  in a well funded start-up.<br/><br/>I am ready to join whenever is good for you.<br/><br/>I will be fully remote (unless you have office in Goa, India)<br/><br/>Contractual or normal job both welcome. But I am mainly looking for financial  reward more than ESOP kind of things.<br/><br/>I have worked in remote first teams for a good part of my life, so don't worry I know what I am doing.<br/><br/>I can always adjust my schedule with you.<br/><br/>I will be travelling in Feb so there will be a period of about three weeks when I won't be working. (I can start after that, if that suits you better)<br/><br/>I am more than happy to have a virtual coffee with you if you think that is worth it. And I am looking forward to join an exciting organisation, solving a meaningful and challenging problem.<br/><br/>I am also attaching my CV with this message. And I wish you all a very happy new year ahead! :tada:

Hi everyone, I’m Vlad currently SDE @ Amazon.<br/>I’m fascinated by a cluster of things that the following labels approximately points at: Tools For thought, Cognitive Augmentation, Novel HCI approaches, future of programming, personal data infrastructure<br/>Also “malleable software” as I quite enjoy building things that have an immediate impact on my experience of using computers.<br/>And I’m interested in making it easier for people to do that/coming up with ways to make our environment more hackable in general.<br/>Most of my popular OSS work is around enhancing the tools in the areas above (<a href="https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit">https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit</a><a href="https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit,">,</a> <a href="https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki">https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki</a> etc)<br/>Another thing I find fascinating is DSLs (with focus on internal ones). I did a talk on what kind of delightful things you can do to Python to make it better suitable for writing DSLs (<a href="https://twitter.com/VladyslavSitalo/status/1344539651818758144?s=20">https://twitter.com/VladyslavSitalo/status/1344539651818758144?s=20</a> )<br/>-<br/>I’m currently trying to figure out how to work on something within that cluster of things full time. So if people have recommendations for <b>companies they find fascinating in the area - I’d appreciate if you can share them :)</b>

:wave: Hello! I'm Daniel, and my passion is for design tools. Specifically, I’m very interested in tools that allow designers to have more autonomy, allowing them to ship things and freeing them from relying on engineers. I’m a designer and engineer myself, currently working at InVision as an engineer on the <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/design-system-manager">Design System Manager</a> team.<br/><br/>My big project at the moment is to articulate the vision I have been working on for the last few years in a meaningful way. It’s all about making it possible for designers to build user interfaces and collaborate with engineers rather than draw pictures of things and then “hand off” to engineers. Realizing this vision would involve creating several new tools, and — maybe more important — a new way of thinking about what designers are responsible for and how they collaborate with engineers.

I have a management role and don't do too much coding now. But am interested in meta data, meta models and the boundary between code and data.

Hi everyone, my name is Fred, I'm 24 and live in the uk.<br/><br/>I've spent the last year obsessively thinking about some crazy idea I had, of representing an application as a graph data structure, in which everything (ui, logic, state, assets, everything) can be boiled down to edges and vertices. I thought this was the basis to do so many interesting things like code generators, low-code type tool, and even the theory behind it. <br/><br/>I never knew that there was a whole active community behind a lot of the ideas I've been thinking about. This has blown me away, made my entire day, even. I've never spoken about this type of stuff to anyone because I never thought anyone would even care, but to see that I was completely wrong is awesome!<br/><br/>Honestly, I haven't worked on my project for ages, after being busied by personal issues, but the past few days going through all the work and information from this community really revitalised something. All of a sudden, it's all I can think about again.<br/><br/>I don't have anything to show yet, but hopefully I'll share progress with you guys soon. I don't really know what else to say in this post, so I'll leave it at that :woman-shrugging:<br/><br/>Good day

Hello Everyone,<br/>My name is Greg and I’m a software engineer at Adzerk, where I get to code in Clojure, doing backend development and data engineering. Big fan of Lisp, Functional Programming and PL topics in general, with a keen interest in how FOC ideas can make data exploration and analysis easier and more accessible for everyone, including non programmers.<br/>Few years ago I had a chance to work on Mathematica inspired custom language with Notebook based UI and backed by Hadoop Data Lake, built as a data exploration platform for a financial institution and it was quite an eye opening experience.<br/>I’m very excited to discover that there is a community of people sharing the dissatisfaction with current state of programming and dedicated to exploring ideas on how to improve its future!

Hi everyone! I'm Paul, one of the creators of the Unison language (<a href="https://unisonweb.org">https://unisonweb.org</a>). Happy to be here!<br/><br/>A while ago I did experimentation with a structured editor for Unison where syntax and even type errors were ruled out by construction. It was neat but it raised a lot of questions about how to make the experience nice enough to actually use for real editing. For Unison, we came up with a very nice way to make codebase-level edits and refactoring without ever going through broken states, but for editing or writing individual definitions, I think it's harder to displace text editing (even though the benefits to doing so are huge).<br/><br/>I've enjoyed following along over the years with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Cyrus Omar</span> work on Hazel and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Eyal Lotem</span>'s work on Lamdu, among others, and glad to see people making more progress on this stuff. The Unison team is looking to pick up this topic of structured editing again soon now that Unison's core language is getting more settled (we're working on getting a non-alpha release of Unison soon). So maybe there will be opportunities to collaborate with folks here. :slightly_smiling_face:

that's all done and released. So phase 2 is to get that integrated into Maria.cloud, and augment Maria so that code in Maria documents can depend on code in other documents (which will unlock lovely stuff that I won't spray right now, but happy to discuss more!)

Hey folks, I'm Aria :wave:<br/><br/>Like most people here, I daydream FOC ideas :smile: I'm usually thinking about the gaps that separate groups of people, and how tools and languages can bridge those gaps.<br/><br/>I've been <em>trying</em> to do this as my job since 2014, but only managed to get there three years ago. I've been funding it with consulting, grants, and two very helpful angel investors.<br/><br/>What I'm working on is an authoring environment where developers and designers make things together. I usually describe it as a design tool that "blurs the line between designer/developer, author/consumer, and artist/scientist." If that sounds lofty, it's because it is. Right now it's just a modest animation editor for web apps that can be used by both designers and developers.<br/><br/>Short-term, it scratches an old itch. I always wanted to draw and code the same kind of stuff.<br/><br/>Long-term, I think this kind of environment (one that bridges manual and procedural creation), can be a building block to other FOC applications, like data/interactive journalism, exploratory learning, and trans-disciplinary authoring environments.<br/><br/>Also as a side-project, I'm building a personal memex. (<em>who isn't?</em> :man-shrugging:)<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm always up for a <a href="https://twitter.com/ariaminaei">call</a> to bounce ideas :blush:

Hello I’m John.  I live in Southern California and I currently write a lot of rust on the front and backend of an ad exchange. I have written PureScript, elm and Haskell previously. I love the future of programming. There are three or four topics that are at the top of my mind recently: types as visual design, polymorphic version control and diffing, type theories for tierless distributed computing, and user operations and self hosting with functional package management.

Hi everyone, I'm Luis. I'm originally from Colombia, but have lived in the Bay Area for many years. I worked as a software / infrastructure engineer at startups and bigger companies for a while and have often had to rewrite backends to be more efficient or scalable. I dream of a day in which the same program/backend can run on a single core or across many machines in the cloud without any operational complexity (extra deployment configuration or maintenance), extra code (frameworks or vendor APIs) or constraints (delayed execution, limited runtime, no persistent connections, etc). I created a new programming language with a friend to see if we could create a compiled language with a simplified bytecode, wrt to traditional languages which allow arbitrary computation that is not guaranteed to halt, that could be automatically parallelized by a VM/runtime (written in Rust :crab:) based on the size and shape of the data. It is still very much in an alpha state, but lmk if you want to learn more or have feedback for us!<br/><a href="https://github.com/alantech/alan">https://github.com/alantech/alan</a>

Hey folks, I'm Mohammad (go by Mo). I live in Ottawa, Canada. I spent most of my career in Product Management at Shopify. I left in 2018 to start my own business and am currently working on an idea that would best be described as "low code for devs, not no-code for non-devs".  Something like a bundled Firebase or the old Parse Cloud product Facebook bought, but way better. Hope to share a demo with you folks in the coming weeks and get some feedback, and just generally share thoughts and ideas around where development should be headed

Hello there! I’m Sven and I am a UX designer and right now studying strategic design in a small town in the south of Germany. I love to code, mostly frontend and experiments on my server, creative coding, generative design and explore machine learning. I stumbled upon this slack space and I thought this is perfect. I would love to get a glimpse of what the future of coding could be and maybe I can contribute in a meaningful way

Hi! My name's Paul and I love the prompt "future of coding". In the past, I've worked at Facebook and led product infrastructure at Discord. I actually left my job to explore ideas in programming/tools/education and learn more about PL and other things.<br/><br/>Being interested in code/design led me towards frontend/product engineering. Having spent some time here, I feel the tools and levels of abstractions are great but have so much more potential. I'm excited for a day styling (css, etc) is mostly handled in the design tool. Working with code as text files seems primitive. I have many more thoughts and questions :stuck_out_tongue:<br/><br/>Some links: <a href="https://blog.discord.com/discord-react-memory-leak-565c89763e8">Investigating React memory leak at Discord</a>, <a href="https://bypaulshen.com/posts/monads-for-javascript-developers/">Monad tutorial for JS devs</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_paulshen/status/1304855130748063744">Visualizing array.splice</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_paulshen">twitter @_paulshen</a><br/>Excited to be here!

Hi all :wave:<br/><br/>Been lurking here for a while and finally introducing myself (and hopefully getting more active). I'm one of the founders of 3Box, where we've been building a 'decentralized firebase' that lets apps and services store data with users rather than on siloed servers. We're now focused on <a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> - a verifiable information network and 'dataweb' (as opposed to siloed database) - and <a href="http://IDX.XYZ">identity index</a> library for managing identities, users, and other information across any app and platform.<br/><br/>We're really aimed at helping infrastructure and developers that are ushering in a more open, composable, connected web -- which is so many of you here. Happy to talk about anything related to identity, dweb and composable apps and looking forward to continuing to see and learn from your projects and thinking :slightly_smiling_face:

Hey All!<br/>I'm a software engineer by day, working on R&amp;D to make software easier and less expensive to maintain.<br/><br/>For the past couple of years, I've been interested in computational law. I worked a bit on an open source expert system as well as some tools for legal aid organizations in my spare time.<br/><br/>I'm really into personal finance, and I once made a spreadsheet that calculates all of my finances, think a personal double sided balance sheet. Coming back a year later though, it made the engineer side rather unsettled. From there I started researching trying to find (or possibly build) a "better Excel".<br/>And that research has led me here!

Oops just saw in the <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/member-handbook#introduce-yourself">member handbook</a> and #administrivia I should’ve first posted here. So:<br/>&gt; tell us about your background<br/>Originally I got into coding through film. I was preparing for auditions for my first feature. Upon posting a casting notice online I got over 4000 submissions. I had hardly any $$ so I couldn’t hire casting agents or assistants. At that time I started to dabble in coding, mostly making small games like battleship. I realized I could use google sheets + gscript (JS-like scripting around gsuite products) to send emails. I exported all actors data into a CSV, imported it into sheets, rated actors based on their video reels and fit for the role.<br/>Then wrote a 80 line script that sent them personalized emails in which, if their rating was high, they’d be invited to a scheduled audition and when low to an open call. The emails were signed by a made up person “Janina Kebera - Production Office Assistant.” I hacked on the script for 3 days, then pressed a button and it sent 4000+ emails in less than a second.<br/>I got 20 responses in 2 minutes, 40 in 5. I ended up doing the auditions but never the movie. My experience with it was so impactful, I decided to pursue coding instead.<br/>Since then I made <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-learnable-world-20ee8da4690a">Vimsical</a>, <a href="https://github.com/den1k/root">root</a>, genetic algorithms for CSS, trading algorithms, <a href="https://theshopgrid.com/">GRID</a> and a <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/dennis/page/oq8QVA0Sq">few other projects</a>.<br/><br/>&gt; what your interests are<br/>While learning about genetic algorithms I stumbled upon the concept of fitness functions and made my own. It’s <em>“have fun and be curious.”</em> This gets me around.<br/><br/>&gt; how you got into computer futurism<br/>I don’t know if I have. I think we got ahead of ourselves. The future lies in the past.<br/><br/>how you found the Slack<br/>&gt; I got introduced to Steve Krouse in the early days of FoC<br/>interesting hobbies<br/>&gt; only code makes it online :wink: so here’s my <a href="https://github.com/den1k">github</a><br/>Really love skimming through the posts here. People are up to amazing stuff! Feedback is constructive, people help providing context through links etc. Thanks everyone and especially <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> for all your hard work on FoC.

Hi! I'm Denny Vrandečić. I am the founder of Wikidata, and am working now on a new project for the Wikimedia Foundation which we currently call Wikilambda (a naming discussion will start soon) with the goal to democratize coding and access to code by providing a "Wikipedia of Functions".

Hey everyone! I'm <a href="https://kabir.sh">Kabir</a>, a junior in high school. I worked at <a href="https://webflow.com">Webflow</a> this past summer and had the opportunity to hack on some very cool things that definitely would belong here :eyes:. For me, what started as an interest in compilers and programming language theory spiraled into the urge to make something more consistent and expressive than the programming environments we have today. I've been following a lot of interesting projects for the past few years, and they eventually led me here! Super happy that there's a thriving community centered around this space :slightly_smiling_face:

Hi all! I'm Nilesh from India (<a href="https://twitter.com/nileshtrivedi">nileshtrivedi</a> on Twitter). I have been interested in the craft of coding for a while. Years ago, I built this prototype for a live-coding environment. I like what Scratch and Snap! are doing to make programming more accessible. And of course, I dream of futuristic ironman-style coding environments to build systems. My current project is <a href="https://learnawesome.org">https://learnawesome.org</a> which is an attempt to built Google Maps for learning. Hoping to learn a lot from all of you.

Hi awesome people :wave: I am Dhruv from India. I have been working with ThoughtWorks as a data engineer for about 4.5 years and as a developer trainer for the next 2.5 years. I’m really passionate about teaching and mentoring new developers. <br/>I teach about the fundamentals of OOP, clean code, TDD and CI/CD. A big part of my teaching goes towards how to approach a problem in a structured manner and motivating people to approach things in different ways.<br/>I also teach intermediate developers about big data tooling and make them ready for being a individual contributor for “data” projects.<br/>I am excited to be a part of this group so that I can share some new ideas with my trainees. I’m also inspired by the visions of Bret Victor and the future of programming excites me.

Hello all. I'm Cameron. I found this place in a roundabout way--surfing Chris Granger's Twitter, he retweeted John Edwards who linked to Steve Krouse's Patreon, and enough link-surfing got me here. I'm currently unemployed, but my skills are in full-stack web development. To give you a sense of what interests me, a while ago I put out a project that reduces most conceptual operations on Vue components to 4 or 5 keystrokes made from anywhere in the file, and right now I'm experimenting in the world of self-editing web applications. It's actually surprisingly easy. I built my feasibility prototype as a Rollup plugin for Svelte projects, and it's only ~200 lines to start live-editing the application in place using the same underlying tech as the developer. As a next step, right now I'm exploring what developer tooling looks like when there's no longer any distinction between "editor" and "application".

I hope I will find here some new inspiration and feedback.

As I'm participating more I should probably do this...<br/><br/>I've been programming since the 1970s. Originally focused on physics and mathematics, I was lured astray by certain findings in theoretical computer science. This is my 35th year as a Lisper and Emacs user. My first purely functional programming language was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_(programming_language)">Miranda</a>, c. 1987.<br/><br/>My desert island programming languages are Scheme, FORTH, Smalltalk and ML (Prolog's features are better as a library), but my most used language since 2009 is Clojure.<br/><br/>While I <em>prefer</em> to use highly interactive languages, I've also written millions of lines of C code in the course of my career, which has included all sorts of things from building operating systems, clustered filesystems and high-performance language runtimes to creating the first purpose-built <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore">Triplestore</a> for the semantic web to building some of the earliest streaming databases and complex event processing systems to building a big document understanding system using a mix of modern statistical and classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence">GOFAI</a> techniques (most recent startup exit).<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> interviewed me for the podcast last summer:<br/><br/><a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/041.html">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/041.html</a><br/><br/>At university I also studied classical music composition and played guitar in the jazz orchestra. Some years later, while doing a startup in the Valley, I attended art school at night. If you're interested in some recent work at the intersection of art + tech, here's a talk I gave last autumn in Helsinki:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeXCvh5X5w0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeXCvh5X5w0</a><br/><br/>Looking forward to getting to know everyone. :slightly_smiling_face:

Hello! My name is Kevin Moore.  I’m a sometimes software engineer, occasionally speak at Python conferences.  My most interesting work is social good/political type of stuff, e.g. I was founding CTO of <a href="http://upsolve.org">upsolve.org</a> and I help moderate SandersForPresident on reddit. I mostly view code as a tool to accomplish specific real-life objectives, though I do enjoy sharpening the coding knife.  I run r/LearnJavaScript on reddit, too, and have been idly working on a book about breaking into the coding industry (free at <a href="https://ZeroToCode.today">https://ZeroToCode.today</a>, people with CS degrees may shudder at some of the commentary).   I’ve also been teaching myself to draw, so the book has a lot of <em>very good</em> amateur illustrations.

Hello all! I've been a longtime fan of this community &amp; haven't officially introduced myself. My name is Jeff Morris Jr. - I am now an investor but have spent most of my career building product, most recently as VP of Product, Revenue at Tinder.<br/><br/>My recent favorite investment is Roam Research. I know Conor is a huge fan of this community too.<br/><br/>I wanted to introduce myself to see if any of you are starting companies right now. I find this community to be the most original technical thinkers anywhere on the internet, so I'd be an idiot if I didn't ask.<br/><br/>I launched a product accelerator today and would love to work with folks from this group if you want to start something. Here are more details on that: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/former-tinder-vp-jeff-morris-jr-opens-up-product-club-an-accelerator-meant-to-stay-small-and-focused/?tpcc=ECTW2020">https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/former-tinder-vp-jeff-morr&hellip;</a><br/><br/>Thank you for letting be be a small (and mostly quiet) part of this community. I love the open mindness and creativity that you all share.

Hello everyone :wave:<br/>My name is Tim and I’ve found this community through the Future of coding podcast, episode about relational algebra. <br/><br/>I was always interested in such things like frame-based editing, new ways to program a computer, etc. And I couldn’t imagine that there is a community who also explore “future of coding” :grin:<br/>I’m really excited to be here! <br/><br/>Now I’m exploring the idea to apply relational model to managing state in mobile applications. The main goal is to make mobile app development easier, less error prone and reduce amount of code that mobile developers usually write. <br/><br/>I’m not sure why, but currently mobile applications usually contain SO much code and accidentall complexity that it blows my mind. An app for mobile phone can easily grow to millions of lines of code for moderate functionality and I’m believe we can do better.<br/><br/>I’ve started with Rich Hickey’s talks and “Out of the tar pit” paper and we’ll see where I can get with it.

Hello! I made an account here some time ago but I don’t think I ever posted anything. I’ve been listening to the podcast now and then for the past few years. I’m an interaction designer and front-end developer interested in systems and how they shape work.<br/><br/>I’m currently working on a collaborative JSON editor. I have some future-of-coding-ish ideas that I want to explore in the design, around how to make schemas and automation more accessible to typical users.

Hi!<br/><br/>My name is Jeff Mickey, and I'm an IRL friend of <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tom Lieber</span>'s. I really like defmacro, let over lambda, and really anything to do with code generation. My current project is building a templating system for guile scheme that allows for the data / code divide to become smaller similar to imatix's gsl project. Hope to post some updates about my progress in a while.

Hello everyone :wave:<br/>I'm Apoorv. I came to know about this community via a comment on a recent HN post. To be honest, never gave much thought to futurism or having vivid imaginations of how things can/should be, let alone work on them :smile: . Humble beginnings, hoping to really soak in with the community and learn a ton!

Hi!<br/> <br/>I have already posted some "introduction" more than one year ago, but as today is a kind of "coming out" for me, I post a new one (or at least an update)! :slightly_smiling_face:<br/> <br/>In fact after very busy months on some cool-but-not-FoC-related project, today I start my 100% Future of Programming life. From now on, I will be fully committed in exploring, experimenting, state-of-the-arting, discussing and, of course, building stuff in this very exiting field. I have some ideas to experiment, old prototypes to reconsider (and throw away again after picking the good parts), users to meet, existing tools and languages to explore, etc.<br/> <br/>Here are some quick words on the vision of what I would like to work on. At a very high level, it is all about tools for thought, tools to create, tools to share ideas, tools to program. More concretely, I plan to work on collaborative programming environments usable by non experts. With a focus on how to provide the more expressive/tangible/interactive/malleable views of programming artifacts. As first "proglet" representations, I am thinking to explore two well-known and successful visual ones: blocks à la Scratch and nodes'n wires à la Max/MSP. But with the ability to still use text languages when the visual ones are not appropriate (yet). As they are widespread and covers most of the technical needs, all this will first be based on web standards, which will also ease adoption and meet some common first usages. Another "minor" reason, is that I actually enjoy programming in JavaScript (and even more in Vue.js)! Ok, ok, I can hear half of you saying "oh, nooo! not the web again" and the other half saying "obviously!", while a third half (hopefully, the bigger of the three halves) doesn't understand those petty squabbles. :smile:<br/> <br/>My background is nearly 30 years of professional programming on a wide range of fields (front/back/DB/infra/science/viz/GUI...), five years as an educator for creative computing with kids and adult beginners (mainly with Scratch) and a bit of programming for music/audio (with Live and MaxMSP) some times ago.<br/> <br/>Of course, I hope to be more active in this community (especially, compared to recently). I will be very happy to read and discuss all the very interesting subjects that you all are sharing here (some I have missed recently)!

Howdy folks :wave: <br/>I’m Joe, and I stumbled onto this community via my work with Enso (which some of you may know as Luna language), thanks to Ivan and Mariano on twitter :smile: I work on community and education (docs etc) at enso, but have long been interested in programming language design and Haskell, which is how I came to meet the Enso folks. In the past I’ve spent a lot of time working on initiatives to help young folks, particularly students, learn to code, via Major League Hacking, and GitHub Education.

I stumbled on to "Future of Coding" podcast through an interest in Orca for music. I've been making my way backwards through the podcast and feel like I've found my community. I've long been frustrated with programming tools after I left Smalltalk professionally. There's something to a lively environment that old Lisp and Smalltalk systems gave you. I have always wanted to get "modern" tools up to that standard where you thought only of the problem you were trying to solve. My goal is experiment with keeping focus on the task at hand and not the idiosyncrasies of the language or IDE. Excited to find like minded individuals and hope to participate in the future with others on projects.

I'm a long time listener and big fan of the podcast, but I'm just now getting around to joining the slack. I'm a big fan of Bret Victor (like many here I'm sure). I love experimental programming language design and compiler theory. I'm heavily involved in the nim-lang community, my niche language of choice. Where I differ from the mainstream is that I am not a fan of the modern web. I'm a big fan of Jonathan Blow, Casey Muratori, the "handmade" movement, and the ideas of "mechanical sympathy". I favor returning to native apps over web technologies everywhere. I feel like I'm a weirdo for being interested in both "the future of code" and also interested in low level computer optimization, but I believe it's possible to have the best of both worlds (at least that's my dream)! I am more about "raising the ceiling" than "lowering the floor" of programming. I come down firmly on the belief that computers are like a musical instrument, and we don't need to dumb them down (and slow them down) with an ever growing pile of abstractions, we instead need to provide a structured ladder of abstractions that can enable more expression. I will probably spend most of my time lurking, but I'm excited to be here and see what everyone is working on!

I just discovered this Slack while trawling r/programminglanguages! I'm hoping to meet some people with similar interests to mine. I'm an idealistic software developer who keeps getting distracted from actual projects by thinking about how cool computing <em>could</em> be if our tools were better. I usually view language design as part of a continuum with API design, OS design, and databases. Currently in the DC area. Looking forward to talking with you all!

Hi all! I’m a mostly self-taught web developer interested in GUI programming. I have that unfortunate type of personality very high in Openness and very low on Conscientiousness which means that I’m infinitely curious about a whole lot of things but I end up doing very little about it. My main interest around the topic of this Slack is the idea of a cross-platform GUI library that would allow the implementation of apps that would work wonderfully on all 3 big operating systems. I’m a huge fan of the work of Alan Kay at VPRI.

I've been posting a few things, so I feel like its time for me to drop an introduction in here. My name is Aleks. I'm a software engineer living and working in Massachusetts. I went to school for game development, but fell in love with programming languages and web development along the way. I'm interested in building tools that make computers easier to use without paving over the underlying complexity of computing. I believe when there's a dissonance between what a program appears to be doing and what a computer is actually doing, it causes pain all up and down the stack - from end users to the folks designing the silicon.<br/><br/>I have a terrible track record of leaving projects unfinished, but I will include a link here to one of my more finished projects - a command line tool for working with tags the same way you would work with files. <a href="https://github.com/alekslitynski/tagsystem">https://github.com/alekslitynski/tagsystem</a>. Like everyone else here, I'm currently hacking on a visual programming system. I'm hoping to get it to a point in the next few months where other people could jump on board and participate in its development, if they want to.<br/><br/>This community seems wonderful, and I'm excited to dive into it.

Hi all!<br/>I'm a web applications developer. I'm really excited by the idea of bringing programming to a less technical audience, in a way that they can easily understand, whilst being based on rigorous paradigms (without making a big song and dance about that), and having their work translate down to something a professional programmer could (and would be glad to) inherit.<br/>I've been catching up on the podcast slowly but surely and it seems like this is a community that has much in common with me. Glad to be here!

Hey! I’m Ollie, a language and text editor nerd writing Clojure for fun and profit! Currently at Viasat hacking on parens.<br/><br/>I’ve been working on interactive programming tools for Vim for the last few years, my pride and joy so far is Conjure (<a href="https://github.com/Olical/conjure">https://github.com/Olical/conjure</a>), interactive lisp evaluation for Neovim. The primary language is Clojure but it also supports Fennel and Janet with Common Lisp potentially being the first contributed client! <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/325517">https://asciinema.org/a/325517</a><br/><br/>This work got me interested in the general concept of having a conversation with your program so I wrote that up here: <a href="https://oli.me.uk/conversational-software-development/">https://oli.me.uk/conversational-software-development/</a><br/><br/>And now I have an itch to develop a 3D spatial non-text programming environment with stepping / time travel through the execution of the program based on ClojureScript in the browser. Another goal of this is full VR support where you’re exploring the program in space. The program itself would eventually be exportable and runnable wherever you wanted. This is an experimental concept that I don’t intend to be used in anger, but I want it to be good enough to solve Advent of Code problems, for example.<br/><br/>After ranting about this on twitter I was directed here and I’m so glad to have discovered you! :smile:

Hey, I'm Howard and I'm a programmer and tech lead at <a href="http://tray.io">tray.io</a> - it's a visual programming tool which allows you to build programs that run on our platform. One of the exciting things about it is lowering the barrier to entry of programming and opening up it's reach to a larger and more diverse group of people in the world. I'm very interested in building higher levels of abstraction than the current programming languages we have today and wanted to learn more about the work other people are doing in the area and also connect with likeminded people.

Hi all, I am Andrew Sernyak and I am a software architect at work and clojure hobbyist at my spare time from Ukraine :flag-ua:.<br/><br/>I've stumbled upon a future of coding podcast with Jonathan Edwards, then I saw Wildcard by Geoffrey Litt and so, here I am.<br/><br/>I am frustrated with the current state of things in software development and I am trying to bring back the joy of coding I once had. I've started widening my horizon by just thinking of other ways of building software, reading old programming papers and digging into computing history, instead of learning yet another js framework.<br/><br/>Currently I experiment with some ideas by creating specialized software just for myself, like web-page scraping, personal blog, etc.

Hi, I've long been in pursuit of great code. That's taken me on a journey to explore the creation of programming langauges and their influences. I would love to connect with others that have felt like the current languages hold them back.

Hi everyone! I'm Robert. I'm working on designing a hobbyist processor architecture that is designed to fit in a single person's head. The ultimate goal is to get a full software stack sitting on top of it that is useful from micro-controllers to serious desktop processing, simple enough to be fully understandable by a single human mind and yet powerful enough to do so-called "real" work. I basically want to figure out how simple we can make our entire software stack and perhaps unlock even more potential in the world by doing so.

Hey everyone, long time lurker here! I'm a software engineer in San Francisco. Over the last couple years, I've been playing with a handful of flow-based programming tools and prototyping my own. My main interest is in tools that make programming more accessible to everyone, especially those without technical backgrounds. I believe that the flow paradigm is intuitive and flexible enough to become a mainstream interface that everyone can use to manage their data, devices, etc.<br/><br/>I started working as a fullstack eng at <a href="http://Parabola.io">Parabola.io</a> just a couple months ago. It's a web-based flow tool for connecting and processing data from a wide range of other cloud platforms. Think flow programming meets IFTTT meets Excel. It's been an interesting shift in mindset, going from daydreaming about a flowy future to building a product that needs to solve practical needs for users! :slightly_smiling_face: It's a fun challenge, and I hope to share a few insights in the future!<br/><br/>Hopefully you'll see me jump into some conversations around Slack and Twitter. And if you're playing with Parabola, I'd love to know what you think. Please reach out if you need a hand with anything (tech issues, feature requests, pricing, etc)

Hi, I’m Andrew — I started studying CS after choosing a major in EE. My first professional experience was as a firmware engineer, now I’m a web developer (as tends to happen in our field).<br/><br/>I was inspired by this article: <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/notes/alan-kay-lunch.html">https://futureofcoding.org/notes/alan-kay-lunch.html</a> which is how I found the community. I want to push the needle forward for the field, and I want to try my hand at doing more “academic” work than I’m typically used to as a web developer, which is mostly remixing components so your customer has a good experience.<br/><br/>Hoping some people here are interested in doing the same and can point me in the right direction :slightly_smiling_face:

Hello! My name is Haakon and I'm a pretty fresh software engineer (around 1 year of experience and 1 year as a "data person" in a start-up) focusing on discrete optimization: routing and network planning in particular. Before that I dabbled around in mathematics for some years.<br/><br/>It is only this last year that I have worked with a real, running software system that has grown organically over many years, with all the kinks and constraints from previous design choices that entails.  I often find myself thinking (and occasionally screaming in frustration) "there must be a better way to do this" so I am hoping to find some inspiration here and to hopefully contribute as well!

Howdy, I'm Jean-Louis. I'm a code monkey located near Seattle. Been working on a few different programming languages over the years (mostly dialects of existing ones) but my most recent (and on-going project) is called _<a href="https://f1zz.org/">fizz</a> (<em>always looking for feedback :flushed: </em>)._  Will probably be lurking more than actively participating to conversation, but super excited about the future of programming in general (and more specifically AI tooling). Cheers!

Hey Gang! I've been listening to the podcast for a while (I think I cam across it after seeing some of Ivan's Hest gifs on twitter) - anyway love the idea of the 2 minute week and thought I'd stop lurking and start participating.<br/><br/>I have a background in architecture (physical buildings), somehow found myself making project management software for architects. I now find that a bit conventional and am trying to take it to more interesting places (2 minute video soon!)<br/><br/>I've been trying to show my developer and designer friends Bret Victor videos for years, and they never get it - it's good to find others equally interested in the future of programming! (for the longest time I though I was the only one haha) I enjoy programming but also find it kind of terrible. All these things you're all working on are very amazing and I hope to use them to improve my life one - and hopefully I can even participate a little as well!

Hi folks! I’ve been listening to the podcast for a while now; thought I’d stop by and say hi :wave:. I’m a programming languages / compilers / virtual-machines enthusiast by night (engineer at a mid-size tech company by day). In a past life, I helped build/maintain a small JVM called Avian (<a href="http://github.com/readytalk/avian">github.com/readytalk/avian</a>).<br/><br/>Currently tinkering with building a new programming language trying to blur the lines between imports (at a file level) and package/dependency management (at a project level). Nothing to share yet, but interested to chat if there are folks with similar interests.<br/><br/>Cheers!

Hi folks, let me do my introduction to this delightful community. I’m an industry coder currently doing webdev and frontend at Shutterfly. A few years back I was building a cool language for live programming called Circa-lang, which I showed at a few conferences.  That project is no more but I’m still interested in building the next generation of dev ecosystems. These days I’m more interested in how we can expand the role of databases and/or spreadsheets, and reduce the need for coding.<br/><br/>On my bookshelf right now is a biography on Wittgenstein, and a Minecraft story book (since the kids are full-on crazy about Minecraft right now). Nice to meet you all

Hello, I'm Thomas. I'm a former book seller/video game journalist (and fighting game nerd) turned UI and Accessibility developper. I don't have anything noteworthy to share about the future of coding, I'm mostly helping friends getting their own websites for personal and fun projects to fight centralization. I like the podcast and as a former art student, I'm very interesting in visuals and code related stuff. For a few months now I have started seeing code not only as a production tool but as a self discovery tool. I'm starting to build my own tools to fit my needs, asking myself actually how do I like doing things, instead of doing things with other people's way of doing.<br/><br/>I'll probably lurk on what you post and discuss to educate myself. Thanks for having me!

Helloo, I’m Jeff. Been lurking here for a month or so but after reading the community survey transcript I realized I should speak up. You see, my current FoC project is building an <a href="https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/">open-source version of Roam Research</a>, but I’m mainly just doing this to learn Clojure. Why? Because what I really want to make is a chat client built on top of a graph database that supports bi-directional links and multiple indexes (i.e. chronologically of course but <em>also</em> by tags that can organically emerge as channels similar to Zulip).<br/><br/>Conversation is personally my favorite Tool for Thought, but we haven’t quite cracked it digitally. Can we have frictionless divergent streams, but also refined, retrievable evergreen posts? This <a href="../linking-together/1574069038.213900.html#1574674319.319600">message</a> by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mariano Guerra</span> sums it up so well, and I have to agree… I’d be so sad if I never found it! Looking forward to continuing the conversation :wink: here and on <a href="https://twitter.com/tangjeff0">Twitter</a> if you’re into that sort of thing

Hi all, I am an ex-mathematician turned programmer interested in stuff like type theory functional programming etc. Professionally I work on a bioinformatics platform written in haskell. I am also interested (but much less knowledgeable) about creative programming and ways to make programming accessible. I was inspired to join the slack after the excellent recent episode on the survey of the community. Previously I only listened to the podcast (which <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> has so far been killing it on) but am inspired to see what the wider community is like.

Hi all! I'm Maikel. I am a freelance software developer from the Netherlands mainly focussing on web currently. In my spare time I am working on a visual flow-based programming environment which can be used in existing projects in both frontend and backend (I receive a subsidy for this via "Wbso" here in the netherlands). And always looking around me to learn more about the (near) future of our great profession and this looks like a great place for that :grinning:. Thanks!

Hi all! I'm Ian. I've spent my recent years focusing on VR creative tools, and I've started to think about how one might code within VR, without a textual interface. That category of thinking has led to a lot of interesting discoveries, including this community! I'm looking forward to learning from this community!

Hi, I’m Danny. I’m director of strategy at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and part of my job is to make sure that a better future of coding isn’t impeded by political or societal actions — stuff like overbroad cybercrime laws or ill-fitting intellectual property systems. I came here via exploring the Malleable.systems site, and realizing there was a whole ecology here that I’ve been orbiting without ever quite realizing. Thank you for having me!

Hi all, I'm Miguel.<br/>I'm a first-year undergrad CS student in California (moved here from France 7 years ago). I usually do high-level stuff like web &amp; game development, but have been getting interested in PL theory and other more theoretical aspects of computing. Wanting to learn more, I researched online and found this community. I'm excited to learn from (and maybe contribute to) the conversations on here.

Hi everyone! I’m Joel and I’m an entrepreneur and consultant in Business Intelligence. I’m developing a DSL and development environment for transparent data processing, i.e. a language to build data warehouses and reports in a collaborative environment where both developers and domain experts can understand what the program does even in large systems. I’m interested in everything relating to this, e.g. data processing and visualizations, PL theory, Category theory, code editing, code management and more.

Hi! I’m a newcomer from Almaty, Kazakhstan. Thanks for the invite <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Cole Lawrence</span>! I moved to the US 8 years ago to go to boarding school. After getting kicked out &amp; repeating junior year 3 times, I ended up studying entrepreneurship at New York University. There, I launched &amp; failed my first startup, built the biggest entrepreneurship community &amp; worked at a few accelerators. I also became obsessed with discovering and trying new tools and products.<br/><br/>After I graduated last month, I moved to Palo Alto with my mom (55), who is starting a new business and restarted studies at Stanford. So pumped for her!<br/><br/>I’m working on building a remote school that teaches people how to be more efficient at work using nocode and visual programming tools. I think this could be something like Lambda School but I’m doing more research on that. I’m running two experiments until figure out the model:<br/><br/>1. <a href="http://optemization.com/home">Optemization</a>: agency that helps startups build &amp; automate ops without code. Made $16,520.<br/>2. <a href="http://optemization.com/automagic-upcoming">Automagic</a>: production &amp; curation of no-code &amp; ops content. Got 234 subscribers (pre-launch).<br/>&lt;/lifestory&gt;

Hi all, long-time listener first-time caller... or something like that. I've been listening to the podcast for a while, and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mariano Guerra</span>’s excellent newsletters convinced me to finally join the Slack group.<br/><br/>I'm a programmer in Vancouver. Bret Victor was my gateway into all this. Inventing on Principle changed my life, it convinced me to quit my job and take a long sabbatical last year.<br/><br/>My professional life is mostly .NET and web stuff in finance. I'm currently interested in ways to make spreadsheets a better programming environment. I'm a big fan of <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Glen Chiacchieri</span>'s Flowsheets prototype, let me know if you have any other recommendations!

Hey everyone,<br/>I'm a gamedev at an indie studio and before my bg was in real time raytracing research. I stumbled on this community while researching the current state of the art of node editors for implementing my Nth node/visual editor.  My holy grail is trifecta of performance by default, rich visualization/debugging, and adding a procedural/scripting layer to tools for artists. Currently to me, the solution to those goals converged to imperative  programming with a functional core, relational code architectures (e.g. in games ECS over OOP). I just discovered "Language oriented design/projectional editors" which seem to be the final missing piece so I'm excited to dive more

Hi everyone :wave:,<br/><br/>Not sure exactly where I found FoC but great to be here.<br/><br/>I'm a bit of a generalist out of Berlin. Interests of mine are more broad than deep and include technology, philosophy and economics. I have been a programming hobbyist since taking a handful CS courses in college and now my involvement with it has ramped up.<br/><br/>Anyways, with my intro, I wanted to share a short article I researched and wrote after seeing connections between a talk and a book I was simultaneously reading. There has been some interesting commentary on reddit, nonetheless I think you all may find it interesting and I would love to learn from you: <a href="https://blog.deta.sh/assembly/">https://blog.deta.sh/assembly/</a><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Max

Hi everyone :wave: . Really glad to be here. I'm a software engineer located in the Netherlands. I really enjoy working on developer tooling. Recently I've been pretty passionate about LSP (Language Server Protocol), and have been actively working on <a href="https://scalameta.org/metals/">https://scalameta.org/metals/</a>, the Scala Language Server and the Vim client. I also enjoy simple tech and exploring what that looks like in it's various shapes. I've enjoyed everything I've listened to and read so far from the Future of Coding, so I hope to continue to learn :smile:

Hello everyone! My pronouns are they/them. I direct research on games/narrative/interactive systems and teach computer science at NC State. I spend a lot of time thinking about making better tools for game development &amp; other forms of expressive computing, combining Programming Languages and HCI approaches. This includes how language design (models of computation) influence how creators think about creative possibility spaces, and about how game design and HCI principles can make programming a more playful, expressive, and joyful experience.

Hi, I'm a GPU Programmer. In my spare time I'm working on a live coding environment.  The integrated editor was the first job (<a href="https://github.com/cmaughan/zep">https://github.com/cmaughan/zep</a>); It has interesting features such as GPU and Qt renderers, and the ability to embed widgets inside the text - it is designed to cleanly support the features I'm going to need in the live coding environment, while allowing me to live code using optional Vim syntax.  The live code part isn't open sourced yet, but I'm hoping to get at least the graphics side of things out the door within the next 6 months.  The renderer can sample audio using FFT etc and respond to music.  I also have an experimental synthesizer along with a work in progress Orca front end to it.  Lots of toys, no time to build them - but I'm making steady progress... :wink:

Hello! joined after hearing about this slack from <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Peak</span> and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Cole Lawrence</span>! I’m 10 years down the rabbit hole of having to learn to code to get stuff done from Excel to VBA to Python to Haskell and JS and it’s exciting to me that there is this community that is passionate about how things could be better! :wave:  oh and I’m in NYC.

Hello. I'm a full stack developer working mostly with JavaScript. Maybe thanks to unix, npm, and functional programming, I'm obsessed with pushing the bar toward simple, modular, expressive, reusable code, but not necessarily any good at it. My primary goal in programming right now is to write or settle on a JavaScript FRP library. To that end, I came across a Future of Coding blog post that talked about Reflex and Hareactive, and that lead me here.

Hi all, Martin here :slightly_smiling_face:!<br/>During college I competed in algorithms, did internships in Google &amp; Palantir and did my Master's thesis (MCS) in the field of bioinformatics (on the algorithmic side). After that I did a startup and worked on different projects, latest worked as a lead engineer for London-based bioinformatics startup (developing a web app/platform).<br/>I am excited about open source, computer science, functional programming, emacs, startups.<br/>Right now I am working with my twin brother on a programming language of our own that is specialized for developing web apps (I will write more about the language in the #share-your-work channel).<br/>I found out about this community through google search, and I am really excited that I will be able to learn from (and hopefully also help) so many experienced people working on similar problems!

Greetings!<br/><br/>Name is Aaron. I'm new to the community, introduced by a good friend. I'm the technical director at Singularity 6, a newish game studio. Prior to that I was at Riot Games for a long time and prior to that a number of non-game tech startups in the US and in China/Hong Kong. I got my start in open source contributions in the Java projects over at Apache.<br/><br/>When it comes to the future of programming, I'm particularly interested in (1) practical applications in game development, such as Unreal's blueprints and (2) future productive VR/AR desktop environments. To this day, I'm still most at home in Emacs.

Hello, I’m Mike. I’m a graduate student and my research interest is end-user programming for robots and interactive systems more broadly <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mjyc/">https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mjyc/</a>. Previously, I mainly worked with block-based visual programming interfaces but recently I’ve been fascinated with the idea of solver-aided programming <a href="https://emina.github.io/rosette/">https://emina.github.io/rosette/</a>. So lately, I’ve been thinking about making solver-aided programming more accessible to non-programmer or novice programmers. Nice to meet you all!

Hi folks! Recent lurker. I’m a Senior Engineer at Calendly by day, standard Ruby/React stuff. By night, I construct NES emulators in Common Lisp and ReasonML. I think Paul Chiusano’s Unison and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span>’s Mu are two extremely interesting  examples of FutureComputing :tm: but coming from totally different directions. I wrote up some of my Research Goals here but never made it to grad school so there’s hasn’t been a ton of progress :confused: : <a href="https://blog.kingcons.io/posts/Research-Goals.html">https://blog.kingcons.io/posts/Research-Goals.html</a>

Hi everyone! Been lurking here for a while. I am a software engineer based in London that currently works with python and is interesting in building tools that developers use. Heard about this group from twitter (it was some tweet about category theory). I am always interested in learning more stuff. Plan for this year is to build more stuff :smile:

Thanks for creating this community! I am excited to get to know people here and work together!<br/><br/>motivation<br/>• I'm looking for a programming environment where I can go from an idea to an implementation as quickly as possible.<br/>domain of interest<br/>• I am interested in tools which enable sophisticated end-users to build their own interfaces and functionality to manage their data and social networks, discover like-minded people and collaborate with them effectively.<br/>• I have a particular app/system I want to build — "Network of trust". It can solve the problem of fake accounts (my presentation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZJ-BercOGg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZJ-BercOGg</a>) and also enables you to weigh opinions of different people by trustworthiness of these people derived from trust chains from you to this or that person in the corresponding competence area. (I see it as a solution to what Alan Kay once wrote about: "the [information] retrieval systems of the future are not going to retrieve facts but points of view" <a href="https://vk.com/trustnet?w=wall-56630573_84_r91">https://vk.com/trustnet?w=wall-56630573_84_r91</a>)<br/>ideal<br/>• I want the highest-level programming that is possible: I communicate to an IDE my intentions (goals, restrictions, preferences) and the IDE gives me a working version of a program satisfying these conditions, which I then can customize and try using, then update my intentions and go to the next iteration, etc.<br/>some wishes<br/>• Functionality discovery right in the IDE, integrated with external sources (libraries, APIs). When I want to do something but yet do not know how to do it in this particular language, the IDE should be helpful to find that out (instead of googling manually). Ideally the solutions thus found should be already plugged-in and working with my actual data without the need for manually setting them up. E.g. when I want to plot a bar chart from my data, the IDE fetches several libraries that can do that (sorted by some ranking of relevancy and quality) and shows me the actual results of these options (with my actual data) so I can choose which I like more.<br/>• I can organize my code spatially (in 2D or even 3D). So that when I want to edit my program, I always know where to look for relevant parts of code to edit or add to.<br/>• Structured code editing, with the impossibility of syntax errors. Ability to select and edit whole semantic entities instead of just editing text characters. Convenient refactoring.<br/>programming experience<br/>• I learned a bit of Pharo Smalltalk, then made some projects with Javascript and Node.js (<a href="https://hatsevich.ru/programming_portfolio.html">https://hatsevich.ru/programming_portfolio.html</a>). Working in Pharo IDE was much more convenient then editing text files (javascript/node.js). Maybe I should return to it and use it for backend — unless you point me to something better.<br/>some thoughts on programming I wrote earlier<br/>• "Why programming languages are broken and how we can fix them" <a href="https://www.facebook.com/g.hatsevich/posts/742023955927813">https://www.facebook.com/g.hatsevich/posts/742023955927813</a><br/>• "Tool-oriented programming" <a href="https://www.facebook.com/g.hatsevich/posts/741820789281463">https://www.facebook.com/g.hatsevich/posts/741820789281463</a><br/>Interesting links on the "perfect programming" topic I found I posted here: <a href="https://vk.com/perfect_programming">https://vk.com/perfect_programming</a>

Hello, I'm Matthew. I'm a software engineer and very interested in the Future of Programming. I'm here both for my personal interest and my day job, as I work at the firm behind HighGear, which is a no code workflow platform. We enable business analysts to implement sophisticated business process requirements in an ergonomic and powerful visual programming language. I understand that the no code movement has some bad rep in this community, and I (and we) are not threatened by that. I'm excited to learn more about and discuss the future of programming and computing with you all!<br/><a href="http://highgear.com">http://highgear.com</a>

Hi there, I'm excited to talk about interesting things with everyone!<br/><br/>• I'm building a p2p offline distributed database in my free time (I have a day job unfortunately).<br/>• I've been really interested in EAV stores / Datalog lately. I think its a really flexible and general model for representing information while also having nice offline-syncing properties.<br/>• I'm considering using Hypercore, but the code is really hard to follow and feels too complicated. Does anyone know any better alternatives for secure p2p append-only log syncing?<br/>• If anyone else is working on something in this domain, I'd <em>love</em> to chat about it.<br/>You can find more about me here: <a href="http://www.chetcorcos.com">www.chetcorcos.com</a>

Hello! I wish I would have found this forever ago - I'm a software engineer that's extremely interested in programming language design, and I'm currently working on a language concept (deterministic, metaprogramming, and code-completable editing). <br/><br/>I got interested in programming languages while working extensively on various libraries for mobile/back-end/web (Kotlin), as I frequently found myself fighting language limitations to make the most intuitive and simple API possible. I've made a simple scripting language in the past, and I've managed my way around ANTLR while making a Kotlin to Swift syntax translator. <br/><br/>I've sure been humbled just reading about the various concepts I've never considered before, especially coding with proofs.  I also feel a little out of my depth with some of the formal terms here, but I'm excited to learn from you all!

hello all!<br/><br/>im a software engineer by trade but very interested in forward looking programming languages as a hobby.<br/><br/>im not sure exactly how i stumbled across this slack, but i have been lurking the programminglanguages subreddit for awhile and believe i saw it linked there.<br/><br/>i was drawn to the topic of programming language design and theory by my experimentation with haskell over the years, and the intense curiosity i found in the haskell community for pushing the language to its limits. since then i have consistently been very drawn to various functional languages, particularly purely functional stuff. the recent thing that has been interesting me is algebraic effects, particularly in the ability system provided by <a href="http://unisonweb.org">unisonweb.org</a>. i have been doing some tentative explorations into a lambda calculus based language myself, drawing inspiration from haskell, unison, reasonml/ocaml, and to a lesser extent, idris, purescript, etc. the syntax will probably be somewhat divergent from the traditions of these languages, as i am interested in seeing how the lambda calculus can be made more approachable for people used to c, java, javascript, python, etc

My main interests are in psychology/introspection/meditation, which if programming=thought, then programming=emotions, programming=pain/pleasure (or to be more precise expressions of emotions, expressions of pain, expressions of any psychic content).<br/><br/>So tools for thought could also be tools for emotions. Emotions are just nonverbal thoughts, anyway. I hope all this progress that we have made with tools where you can see your own ideas =&gt; can be propagated to tools where you can see your own psychological conflicts and problems.<br/><br/>Art has been doing this for millennia (representing our psyche), why can't interactive computing environments do it?

Hi everyone, I՚m Mike, and I՚ve been interested in making programming  expressive and accessible for a rather long time. I was at the MIT Media Lab in its early days, working on the Vivarium Project, and also invented a visual block language that was one of the ancestors of Scratch. Since then I՚ve mostly been working on software to support scientific discovery, currently at the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. These include an early web-based notebook/VPL system called BioBike and most recently a block-based tool for building queries against knowledge graphs[*]. Most of my work is done in Clojure and before that, Common Lisp. I՚m excited to see so much new energy being devoted to improving the experience of programming.<br/><br/> [*] <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qabtwa4p6u48gfy/enflame-clojure-meetup.pdf">https://www.dropbox.com/s/qabtwa4p6u48gfy/enflame-clojure-meetup.pdf</a>

Hi! I'm very interested in the future of computing, especially as it relates to social issues. Also a lisper and PLT designer wannabe (for now). Looking forward to some good discussions!

Hi, I'm Colby, I've been working on the Scratch backend systems since 2015, starting with the MIT Media Lab and we have just moved out of MIT and are officially in our own Scratch Foundation org. My coding history started in 1989 using Borland Turbo Pascal, and has been cross systems/paradigms since that point and in no particular order Perl to Ruby, Python, Java, C, C++, Go, Node, assembly, JavaScript, my own DSLs, and of course Scratch. My current focus is supporting the deluge of Scratch users needs. Long term, I'm hoping to help incorporate Scratch into a cross compiler/cross platform frameworks that allows the ability to use Scratch in much broader contexts. I am based in the Boston MA area. And I was brought here by someone else on the Scratch team!

Hi there! I'm Tuomas, and the author of <a href="http://Operon.io">Operon.io</a> -language. I have played with different programming languages for 30+ years, and felt that the existing languages don't work as I would like them to work, on the real life problems related on my field of integration. I created the initial website for the project, as a starting point for the release process (<a href="http://operon.io">http://operon.io</a>). I haven't yet released the binaries and most of the documentation is yet to be written :grin: I joined here as I felt the purpose of this community is aligned with my mission. I hope to share my thoughts with you, reach some of you to both give and receive feedback. After the project is mature enough I will start to reach out for larger audience. Cheers! :smile:

Hi community! My name is Pere and I'm a PM, ex strategy consultant and robotics researcher. I have been helping people build products and digitize processes for the last 5 years, and eventually came to the conclusion that there ought to be a better way. Recently, I automated one of my data analysis task in python and was greatly surprised at how ridiculously complex it it was to automate something I "programmed" in excel in under 10 minutes. This made me realize the potential is much bigger than what I thought.<br/><br/>Currently I'm exploring ways to enter the space in form of a startup. Really interested into talking to anyone thinking about entering the space, particularly if based in Spain or Greece.

Hey All, I'm Tony. I'm a former EE turned robotics engineer. Been programming since I was a kid as a hobby, but my only formal CS class in school was done in scheme (and it definitely shows!). It's been a long path, but I've moved my way from doing Analog IC's to Embedded Systems to now, where I am part of a team building a platform for distributed soft real-time control of robotic systems that are reactive to their environment. It's a super exciting project because we get to explore a ton of neat areas, both old and new, and enable folks to rapidly put together systems that interact with the real world. Not very often you get to see a guy writing code for a safety PLC discussing an electrical interface with an engineer doing reinforcement learning over high-res pointclouds on a multi-nvidia card box, and they are working on the same project!<br/><br/>Also turns out that the experience I had making block diagrams of signal processing chains and communicating modules, or state machines I made for behavior as an EE might map pretty nicely to mechanisms I'm learning about in the CS world if I call them FRP, or Actor systems, or state charts. And who doesn't love a graphical editor, whether it be for schematics or a distributed system :slightly_smiling_face: <br/><br/>Anyways, I'm in love with the creativity that is out there, and how many other folks are also thinking about how we move coding beyond where it is now. It's often overwhelming for a dilettante like me :-) I'm excited to learn more about what's out there, and to personally up my CS chops and learn some more theory. And of course very excited to share what I can with all of you as well!

Communication and writing have been forms of thought for me for a long time: in math and programming, but also in other areas of interest (meditation, philosophy, language, psychology, ...). I'm interested in learning what folks are working on in this area and to discuss ideas and projects.

Hi y’all, Nick here, founder of CodeCombat–we make a game-based learning platform for teaching kids coding. Got our own code engine to try to make it easier for beginners to learn languages like Python, JavaScript, C++, etc. with friendly error messages, control over code execution, full interpreter/game engine integration, a (disabled) time travel debugger, etc. Love hearing about ideas for how to make learning coding more intuitive.

Hello! Brandon Hudgeons from Austin, Texas. VP Technology at <a href="http://www.schoox.com">www.schoox.com</a> and General Counsel and BTC enthusiast at <a href="http://www.unchained-capital.com">www.unchained-capital.com</a>. I do most of my dayjob coding in Scala right now, but tons of polyglot stuff wherever I go. I have a feeling I know (or rather know of) many of you in here, and I'm angry at <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> for not telling me about this group until today :slightly_smiling_face:. Just a short scroll up #thinking-together tells me that this group addresses lots of my interests, but I think it will take me a week to get through the 64-post-long (so far) thread from yesterday. I've been interested in, listening to, and playing with Tidal for a long time, so having <span style="background-color:#ccf">@alex</span> in here for me is like being in a Slack group with Taylor Swift for a 13 year old girl :heart_eyes:. And wow ... while I was searching for "alex," <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Alex Miller</span> popped up ... I was at the first 4 Strange Loops ... the first one was where I saw Scala for the first time! Glad to finally be in here.

Hi! I'm Jonas, a creative developer in NYC. I make art websites, with a background in fine art and CS. I currently work at <a href="http://frame.io">frame.io</a> where I build their marketing site. Someday I hope to be free from the prison that is HTML and CSS. I've been really interested lately in how to make graphics programming more powerful and accessible, and in building out abstractions for the extremely niche type of web development work I do.

Hi! I'm Vergie.<br/>I'm a software engineer, I work at IT Vendor company from approximately 2 years ago, but now I already resign and got a new office.<br/>when I work as a software engineer at IT Vendor I hate doing the same thing over and over again and take much of time in development.<br/>So I found a senior that teach me a little about no-code development. I keep exploring that thing over and over. and then I create my own no-code development (still not cool enough).<br/>and apply some of less code on my company framework, and it works perfectly to cut off development time. Still need to learn more to create wonderful framework :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>I need your guidance guys :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>Thanks~

Hey! I'm Piotr. I've found FoC by googling for non-coding services.<br/><br/>I've created a service for building machine learning models without coding: <a href="https://mljar.com">https://mljar.com</a><br/><br/>I'm not happy with my service. It's only building ML models. Users need to do a lot of additional work to use the ML model in production. And I think that knowing how to use ML models is maybe too complex.<br/><br/>I would like to extend/change the mljar. I would like to let users do data analysis (dashboards and apps). I've started looking at different non-coding platforms for data science. This is how I've found this community :slightly_smiling_face:

Was just recommended this channel by another member who highly recommended it and I thought it was cool.<br/><br/>I'm a software engineer who recently co-founded a product called Merit (<a href="https://www.get-merit.com/">https://www.get-merit.com/</a>) which connects folks in software teams to senior leaders to grow their craft and career. Before that I built a diversity recruiting platform called Jopwell and led engineering as the CTO.<br/><br/>We use NodeJS, Mongo, and React at Merit, which switches between feeling super hacky :see_no_evil: and super effective :smile: . I'm excited to be in this slack group and learning from folks here!

Hi all, long time lurker here. I love this community; it has so much valuable content and discussions; it also gave us confidence that we were moving in the right direction. As we are getting ready to launch what we (<a href="https://bitspark.de/">https://bitspark.de/</a>) have been working on, I want to introduce our company Bitspark. We started working on a VPL long before we knew that this community existed and where navie enough to not even search for prior art - doh’. We started from an observation we made as everyday programmers. There so much repetition, and you need to be highly trained to be a software engineer. We asked our selves what the world <em>after Programming</em> would look like. That was in early 2018. Since then, we created a VPL runtime (<a href="https://bitspark.de/slang/">https://bitspark.de/slang/</a>) in Golang, making heavy use of Green Threads (each node in the tree is a green thread all connected via channels). That gave us quite the performance out of the box (<a href="https://bitspark.de/blog/benchmarking-slang">https://bitspark.de/blog/benchmarking-slang</a>). We have had our ups and downs and doubts and in the process, went through three different (editor) UIs. And then, in early 2019, we decided we need to build a platform around the runtime and the UI to make it easier to access and run/manage.<br/><br/>And that is what we (soft) launch in early November.<br/>Why am I telling you this? We are looking for like-minded people willing to take the platform for a test drive and provide valuable feedback or provide feedback in any form or shape.

Hi Everyone, I have been working with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Maeliza</span> for the last few months to try to build CodistAI. Developer for last 15/16 years. Started doing Game Development in India back in 2005. Then drifted to Web Application and Machine Learning Engineer. Also super interested into Quantum Computing. I  write time to time for <a href="http://towardsdatascience.com">towardsdatascience.com</a> (<a href="https://medium.com/@rcshubha">https://medium.com/@rcshubha</a>) and working on open sourcing a bunch of notebooks on QC (<a href="https://github.com/rcshubhadeep/qc4cs">https://github.com/rcshubhadeep/qc4cs</a>) I am very happy to join the channel and looking forward to learn a lot. I am very interested to know and connect with developers. I love everything tech :smile: Let's catch up :wave:<br/><br/>P.S. - I also got published from Packt this year - (<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/eu/application-development/data-wrangling-python">https://www.packtpub.com/eu/application-development/data-wrangling-python</a>)

Hi everyone!<br/><br/>I want to make the process of coding closer to how we think about programming. I'm currently experimenting with structural/projectional code editors. I am also fascinated by how structural editors open a window for new programming languages unburdened from text-based syntax.<br/><br/>I don't have much to showcase as I was mostly investigating the field and experimenting with small prototypes in the last few months.<br/><br/>Would be glad to meet someone who's working in the same direction.

Hey there! :wave:<br/>I've been working with a friend on <b>CodistAI</b> (<a href="http://codist-ai.com/">http://codist-ai.com/</a>) for the past two months: it's about navigating and understanding source code in visual and more intuitive way. We render any code as a graph which is diggable, interactive and augmented (with quality and security info).<br/>We came up with that idea bc working on different projects and every time the same question "WTF is happening here ?!" especially when I face some kind of spaghetti code.<br/>Also I'm deeply interested in any way possible to make software development more dev friendly! :nerd_face:<br/><br/>I'm happy to join this channel!

Hi all! I've been working on a web development platform called Boomla for 14 years, I'm sort of coming out of the bush these days. <a href="https://boomla.com/">https://boomla.com/</a> I also call it a Website OS as it is a platform where websites are first-class citizens.<br/>It is a server-side platform, with its own object-oriented filesystem, functional execution model, package management solution, etc. It can currently be programmed in JavaScript on the server, but it will support multiple languages in the future.<br/>It also provides a drag&amp;drop user-interface for end-users to let them build websites. But that's optional, you could build a different frontend for it.<br/>It has a web based IDE and lots of documentation. I made the decision early to focus on the platform and not write any new programming language. :smile:<br/>It was designed to be low on maintenance. The platform is fast and rock solid stable. Developers tend to agree that the most interesting part of the system is the object oriented filesystem with lots of interesting properties.<br/>I'm glad for the existence of the group, looking forward to interesting conversations!

Hi everybody! I’m yet another child of HyperCard hoping to recapture the dream of the ’90s. I’m currently working with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Peter Abrahamsen</span> on an end-user thing; we’re experimenting with building it using a simple Datalog-like model.<br/>Divergently, I’ve spent a lot of time in academia building ecological and evolutionary models, all the while dreaming about more natural ways for scientists to work with computers. (And doing basically nothing about it.)<br/>Less concretely, I’m generally hopeful for a future where many more people view computers as infinitely flexible instruments of creative expression rather than devices limited by what professional software developers are willing to provide.<br/>I’m also interested in how power structures in society have affected the way we use computers—and what we can do about it.<br/>I’m here for the conversations!

Hello all :wave: I like to make stuff out of bits and test new ideas. As many of you I am also a big Bret Victor and Alan Kay fan worring from time to time what went wrong in programming environments that we stuck where we are now. Currently I'm focused on experiments with node-based app for data generation/processing.

Hello, friends. I am the co-founder of a digital product studio in NYC called Postlight, and sometimes write/podcast about technology. Like many here I am a big Bret Victor fan and also enjoy reading up on the history of programming languages/development environments/workstations. I do find myself drifting towards agent-based and simulation tools lately, mostly for fun, particularly NetLogo, and I'm also very interested in sound synthesis livecoding, even though I don't have any musical talent. I'll lurk for a while before saying much so I can understand how things go here.

Hi folks, I'm a long time fan of Edwards and Victor, and the guy behind the aquameta project ( <a href="http://aquameta.org">http://aquameta.org</a> ), trying to prove the concept of (for lack of a better name) "datafication" of the stack.  Aquameta reimplements the layers of a traditional web stack as relational data, so that rows instead of files are the atomic unit.  As an industry, we are really good at building user interfaces to data, and if the whole stack is data, UI that manipulates it very easy to develop.  Explorinng concepts around version control of relational data, datafication of EBNF grammars for data-driven code manipulation from a UI, semantic decoration of the database schema to couple UI components with columns for auto-crud generation that can be progressively enhanced, an on-screen in-app widget editor so that you can edit a UI from within the UI, etc.  Demo videos:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOpj8lvNJtg&amp;t=4s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOpj8lvNJtg&amp;t=4s</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8SYrTmUXgU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8SYrTmUXgU</a>

Hi all. I'm interested in safer, easier to use programming languages. I suppose like many here, I was fascinated by Bret Victor's famous presentation, and I've been following another series of interesting attempts at <a href="https://alarmingdevelopment.org/">https://alarmingdevelopment.org/</a>. Discovered the podcast recently, and hope to find more thought provoking resources here. (I don't think I'm going to attempt to build something myself anytime soon, but one never knows.)

You have done such a great job of making things pretty, and routing the wires nicely. But I think you have picked the wrong level of abstraction to diagram. You are drawing the microscopic local variables, yet in a program like Snake or TicTacToe (see <a href="https://github.com/magicmouse/beads-examples">https://github.com/magicmouse/beads-examples</a><br/>), one has the core model stored in some data structure which holds the source of truth, which for TicTacToe might be whose turn it is, what is in the 9 cells of the grid, etc., then you have the layout of the screen, which has its own data structures, and then you have user input events, which are not data but a stream of inputs driving the finite state machine of the game. There is negligible computation in this example, and if you diagram the functions you would make it less understandable. I like visual tools, but diagramming local variables and formal parameter inputs is too low level IMHO. Lots of things one could draw nicely, but the low level computation is perhaps the least interesting thing to show.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dan Cook</span> Yes, the eventual goal is for Glance to become a code editor/debugger for Haskell or other languages. Currently, Glance drawings don't scale well to large and/or complicated functions, so I have been thinking about how to improve that recently. I think adding a more structured and linearized node layout (in addition to the current layout) with lines/wires routed in a more organized fashion might work. Right now I'm attempting to prototype the new layout by taking textual Haskell code and adding ASCII art lines to it.

Hey, I've seen this before - I think listed on <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span>'s visual programming codex?<br/><br/>Anyway, that's a really neat visualization! Do you have any plans to allow "programming" to be done by direct interaction with such visualizations?

Hi, I'm interested in visual programming languages, and how they could make harnessing computers more enjoyable and accessible for everyone. I have been experimenting with represeting Haskell visually as a way to figure out what the biggest barriers are towards making visual programming languages universally useful: <a href="https://github.com/rgleichman/glance">https://github.com/rgleichman/glance</a>.

Hi.  I'm interesting in scientific computing and how to make scientific programs easier to understand and validate.  Right now my favored approach is building up a program through a series of small changes.  Thanks to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span> for pointing out this Slack and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> for posting a link to my writing here after I posted to Reddit.  I'm located near Urbana-Champaign in Illinois.

hey everyone, i've been lurking here for a while, and i suppose i've finally summoned up the courage to join in on the conversation (you seem like a nice bunch, so i'm not sure why it took me so long :man-shrugging:). i'm a software developer from lethbridge, canada and like many of you, i've been thinking a lot lately about building more humane mediums for creating software. i'm curious: what were you trying to do when you realized that in order to do it, you needed to learn a programming language?

Hi folks!! I’m a brand new baby coder. At 37, I’m changing careers from being a fire-medic, to studying computer science. I love my job but due to injuries, it’s time to move on. Fortunately, I’ve fallen in love with coding and the amount of creativity it takes to solve a problem. Currently I am working through freecodecamp and just started playing with python. Also, MIT open source is absolutely incredible. So thankful for the amount of knowledge they are willing to share.<br/>Steve’s podcast is how I found this group. Hoping I will have some projects to share soon.

Stumbled upon Jim Coplien's work with DCI<br/>-&gt; He talks a lot about Alan Kay<br/>-&gt; became a fan of Alan Kay and found VPRI<br/>-&gt; subscribed to the VPRI mailing list<br/>-&gt; when the list was discontinued, many subscribers replied with disappointment and made our own projects known<br/>-&gt; I made the SomethingNew GitHub repo as a place to collaborate and catalog our ideas<br/>-&gt; people kept adding resources and links, and we started stumbling across other online collections and communities (like Ivan Reese's)<br/>-&gt; Eventually wound up here, but didn't do much and kept wandering and forgot about it<br/>-&gt; Eventually found Dark, and Ellen Chisa (CEO) referred me back to here<br/>-&gt; Discovered that many other individuals and groups I had come across previously (big names and small) and whom I never thought were connected or that I'd come across again ... Many of them are part of FOC, so I concluded that this is some nexus of it all and became active here

:wave: Hi all. I’ve been doing web dev for six years.<br/><br/>Googling Elixir/Erlang stuff →<br/>somehow <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span>’s Vimeo channel →<br/>his interview on the podcast →<br/>this Slack workspace<br/><br/>I’ve never formally studied PL theory/postsecondary math/really anything related, but I’ve skimmed the first page and a half of a lot of PDFs. Like others here, I’m dogged by persistent fantasies about how my programming experiences could be improved, which for me tends to lead to thinking about language user interface design and how programmers experience the meaning of code (so semantics, but in the original sense?). My on-again, off-again pet project is a structure editor that uses color and shape to convey syntax but largely retains the visual layout of text editors.

Greetings from Oakland, CA :wave:. I discovered the podcast about a month ago, binged a bunch of episodes, and started lurking here in slack.  I've really enjoyed the conversations around here.  Not sure I'll have a lot to contribute, but I'll definitely keep listening!<br/><br/>Anyways, I'm a data person who over the years has used a lot of different tools for data wrangling and data visualization (Spreadsheets, Stata, SQL, R, Python, JS, Tableau, among others). My favorite tools are the Tidyverse libraries in R, which have made me more curious about FP and DSLs more generally.

Hi everyone!<br/>Just found this community via Steve’s HN post.<br/>I’m Ian from Croatia, I work as a software architect in an agency primarily focused on mobile development. Been into code generation since I was a kid since I’m too lazy to write code the “normal” way :joy:<br/>Currently working on a “code editor” (I like to call it a software editor or a list editor, like treenotation designer), using kotlin and tornadofx mostly - You starts from the datatypes, workflow connections (visual connect the dots) and ends up with a generated graphql w axon-kafka or molecular.js backend and a flutter mobile app (that’s kinda the MVP goal) but I want it to be language-independent. Basically, I want it to be to IDE’s what Lisp is to Java  My current minigoal  is to use it to write the editor itself, that’s gonna be a PITA in itself but I think I might have it in a month or so. Can’t wait to share it with y’all and learn a thing or two here :slightly_smiling_face:

Hello all.  Also found FoC from the HN catalogue post.  By profession I help build and oversee a range of statistical projection models.  Out of work I'm an inveterate language tinkerer with current interests in static type systems, concurrency and dataflow.

Saw the catalogue post on HN and found it super interesting :slightly_smiling_face: I'm one of the cofounders of <a href="https://withkoji.com">https://withkoji.com</a> , a web-based IDE + hosting platform trying to make it easier for non-devs and junior devs to create games and web apps (JS or JS-flavored things) by remixing existing apps and then using a combination of code and no-code interfaces to create something new. We're fresh out of beta, and already have a ton of different people from all around the world and all walks of life creating all kinds of weird things -- the goal is to do to app development what YouTube did to video publishing. Some more info here: <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/">https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-a&hellip;</a> and here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgpFGMH6VR4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgpFGMH6VR4</a> (long technical video). Anyway, excited to have found this community and look forward to participating more!

Hey there, I'm Jacob. Have been curious about languages for a long time, and programming languages for a slightly shorter amount of time. Not particularly formally educated in either area, but I do enjoy poking around PL environments. Smug Lisp weenie (without a job in Lisp though, so as a hobby only), but I've also been very influenced by my experiences in Smalltalk. Would like to build more environments and less apps, but preferably without inventing a language of my own.

Hi, I contribute to the game engine Godot Engine.  We cater to the surface level understanding of the game designers who barely code, to the gameplay developers who care about games than the complexity of a rendering engine, to the game engine developers who have to provide understanding of all the cases but don't have bandwidth to dedicate to being a gameplay developer.<br/><br/>In Godot Engine, we have several coding interfaces. C++ core, C++ as a shared library GDNative, GDScript which is a custom python-like game script,  and Visual Script which is a Node and Wire graphical editor. <a href="https://godotengine.org/">https://godotengine.org/</a><br/><br/>I and a Google summer of code student have been improving Visual Script from it's current unusable state. <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/gsoc-2019-progress-report-3#visual-scripting">https://godotengine.org/article/gsoc-2019-progress-report-3#visual-scripting</a> The work has been done, but it's not fully merged yet. Godot Engine is not just capable of games, imagine using a single executable editor / game for other things!

Hi everybody, I just found this community today through the Whole Code Catalog that was getting shared on Twitter, adding the podcast to my list as well. I’m an engineer working on design and prototyping of voice user interfaces at Adobe, primarily on Adobe Xd and previously at my startup Sayspring that focused on Alexa and Google Home.<br/><br/>Tend to stick to HN and Twitter (@scottwernerd), and ran into <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> online a while back through Ribbonfarm and his blog. Actually got into an argument the other day around code style that ended with me sending someone a link to one of your old blog posts :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>Anyway, current side project is working on an idea around reading and exploring code I got from the end of The Timeless Way of Building. I don’t have the book with me, but the drawings on the right side on page 488 are the key idea - being able to visualize how code evolves over time at different levels (project, file, class, function, etc). I’m still in the early stages, so don’t really know if anything interesting is going to fall out, but happy to chat more if that sounds interesting to anyone.

Howdy everyone, I'm an American living in Paris very interested in democratizing the development of apps and programs. My current controversial opinions/hypotheses are that in most companies design and product really do most of the "programming" (but little of the coding), developers have developed internal models of the subsets of Turing machines that behave well but we haven't made those explicit, and category theory may provide a useful way to model programs and guarantee properties under composition (but currently feels primarily descriptive).

On a tangent, I <em>love</em> the idea of mentioning favorite forums/watering holes in one's introduction. Can densely convey a lot of intangible information to just the right people. I used to do it a few years ago, but fell off the wagon. Thanks for the reminder!

Aloha everyone. I'm Breck, a researcher at the UH Cancer Center Honolulu. My main communities these days are HN, Lobsters, /r/programminglanguages/, and SUS. I work on Tree Notation and am creating the Tree Notation Lab here. Our theory is there is a natural notation sitting between binary notation and higher level languages that has been overlooked and it could be a silver bullet. We call it Tree Notation and it's very promising (though we might have some details wrong---always looking for help). To be thorough, we build the largest database of programming and computer languages in the world with over 10K languages and over 1K columns (in the process of open sourcing it!). The first key applications we are working on is for a new data science language and studio for cancer/bioinformatics researchers, and a new grammar for electronic medical records. We are also helping over 30 companies now experiment with new languages in domains from tax returns to logic languages to visual ides and new languages for deep learning. DC referred me to this community and it looks very cool! I have never gotten into the Slack habit, so I apologize for noob mistakes.

Hi everyone! I’m Izu. I’m a developer and product designer, currently at Mailchimp, and have had an intense fascination with interfaces and the democratization of computing for as long as I can remember.<br/><br/>I fully believe that to expand access to the computer’s nature as an interactive medium, we have to provide tools beyond code that enable everyone to take part, just as Photoshop did for image editing or the typewriter did for text, and I’ve been working on a project with just that in mind. However, I’ve been in a silo on this and I’m just beginning to discover all of the incredible research and resources out there around visual programming and conveying interaction beyond code.<br/><br/>I can’t wait to hear more about the ideas for what’s next that y’all are working on. :pray:

Hi all, I am engineer in industry for a while, but lately I am getting more involved in research as well and trying to find the right blend for myself. My main communities these days are Mozilla, LLVM, and Matrix. I recently moved from Chicago to London.<br/><br/>I believe mainstream computing has failed to deliver on many of the ways it could be empowering everyone in society (not just specialist programmers) and enabling communities to create and share specialised solutions to long-tail problems that improve their daily lives. I am exploring various approaches to restore some of the magic that's been lost. More thoughts on my blog: <a href="https://convolv.es/blog/now.html">https://convolv.es/blog/now.html</a>

Hello, I am currently a student at a coding bootcamp in San Francisco. I have been trying to learn on my own but decided it is best to be in a formal class since I tend to  jump around a lot. I am a Smalltalk fan and love reading about the history of the language and have volunteered for the eruopean smalltalk user group last year. My goal is to contribute to Pharo. I currently am reading Mindstorms by Seymour Papert bc I love thinking about how we learn. I hope that I can find some friends/mentors in this community!

Hi there, I'm Eli Mellen -- I currently live and work in Portland ME. I'm a developer who mostly does web dev,  testing and some product owner-ing right now. This community lives squarely at the intersection of many of my interests, namely exploring ways to make programming more accessible. I pop between a bunch of languages most days, but very much like LISPs, and try to use them whenever possible. <a href="https://eli.li">https://eli.li</a> is my blog, which I use mostly in lieu of bona fide social media these days.

would be interested in how one adds a new language to syntax highlighting for VS Code. Some of the new languages being developed are textual and even many of the graphical ones have a textual output, so making it clearer how one gets syntax highlighting and of even more integration with VS Code, which is a very well received editor, would be helpful.  People develop strong preferences for specific editors, and all younger programmers are used to partial completion suggestions and coloration.

Hello there! My name is Pine and I'm an engineer at Microsoft working on VS Code. I have a short blurb about myself here: <a href="http://blog.matsu.io/about">http://blog.matsu.io/about</a>. I'm not sure how I ended up here, maybe because of the Bret Victor fan club thing, maybe because I sit below the TypeScript team room and Mr. Hejlsberg's influence seeped through the ceiling, or maybe because of the actually really good podcasts by Steve — anyway, nice to be here :stuck_out_tongue:<br/><br/>In my work I maintain the HTML/CSS Language Servers in VS Code, and for fun I'm building the Vue Language Server (<a href="https://vuejs.github.io/vetur/">https://vuejs.github.io/vetur/</a>). I feel Language Server Protocol is one of the interesting/new area of focuses in the language design/tooling space, and I'm exploring with programming tools that complement programming languages &amp; enable new paradigms of programming. I see many interesting conversations and links floating around, and I look forward to joining the discussions!<br/><br/>I'm based in Seattle but would travel to London/Tokyo/NYC soon. To borrow the tweet from ep35, if you are inspired by the Bret Victor talk, or the topics of LSP &amp; programming editors/tools, I'd love to meet you over coffee. Coffee is on me :wink:

Hello folks. I’m an engineer/designer/photographer running a small creative studio in London together with my wife (<a href="https://a.possible.space">https://a.possible.space</a>). I’ve been sort of away from serious programming for the last two years and am slowly getting back to it. Got excited about technology again recently thanks mostly to people I met on Mastodon, and am learning new things again :slightly_smiling_face: Excited to be here!

Hi all! I'm interested in rekindling my love for programming. Somewhere there is a sense of wonder long beaten down by excessive pragmatism since that's what's hot these days.  Is it possible to reconcile these forces when there is too little time and languages and toolsets take time to adopt but most be only superficially different from each other to become mainstream? Let's find out! :smile:<br/><br/>A coworker told me about this group.<br/><br/>I currently mostly do ocaml and python, and some C#.  I love/hate emacs and am trying to do more in VS Code going forward.

Hi everyone, I'm a final year CS student thats very interested in computers and how to make them better. It's tragically easy to imagine better technology and this community and podcast seems aligned with interests in that way (even though I haven't heard many podcast episodes). Looking forward to meeting everyone else and having discussions about computers :)

Hello people,<br/>I found this community while searching for people who are into Flow-Based Programming projects. I am working on a DSL to build up my own FBP over Kotlin. One of the main problems with FBP I faced so far is "Performance Issues". Since you are dealing with some way of communication among the blocks of codes (typically a protocol over socket). I wonder how others see FBP as a general purpose way of coding  while dealing with it's disadvantages like performance issues.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Brendan Zabarauskas</span> something about dependent types feels icky to me.  It's taken reflection over years, but it boils down to principle typing being a sweet spot where you can ask what is <b>the</b> type of an expression.  Knowing additional properties is nice, but there's finesse: what additional type information is relevant for a given task.  For example, within a library you really want to know that data-structure invariants are maintained, but as the user of the library you're happy to ignore those details.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Pezo - Zoltan Peto</span> I’ve actually been pretty fortunate to land a job working on implementing a dependently typed DSL at my job (because my boss is excited about them). But yeah, the more you dig into trying to implement them, the more you realise how much we still need to figure out in order to make them viable. I’m still pretty hopeful though. There’s lots of cool work going on at the moment, especially in the realm of modal type theory, and I’m hoping some of it starts coming together in cool, practical ways!<br/><br/>My advice is to keep plugging away learning, and talk about it online like you’re doing. You might be surprised who you bump into! But it will probably be more of a case of ‘putting yourself in a position to be lucky’, and networking, than finding a job advertised explicitly.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Pezo - Zoltan Peto</span> dependent types are the future but it's perhaps a little difficult to make money at it right now (some folks are making money in the commercial realm proving things with the likes of Coq). In Haskell there are ways of simulating dependent types (<a href="https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/hasochism.pdf">https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/hasochism.pdf</a>). I'm not sure there is any Haskell&lt;-&gt;Unity integration. Looks like Haskell will get full dependent types in the next few years.<br/><br/>As you may not be able to use Haskell for your Unity work, I recall seeing this some time ago:<br/><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/steshaw/status/775271713940475905">https://twitter.com/steshaw/status/775271713940475905</a><br/>Some more tweets here: <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%20unity3d%20idris&amp;src=typed_query">https://twitter.com/search?q=%20unity3d%20idris&amp;src=typed_query</a><br/><br/>I'd never heard of that integration before or since. I can't imagine it's maintained. Idris is a research PL with little funding ATM. Idris v2 is currently under development. I hope it has a bright future.

I have an odd background in entertainment/cinema and engineering, so a lot of my thinking about the future of code come from a lot of thinking about the growing marriage of those two seemingly at odds disciplines.

I was having a conversation with some Svelte.js people (look it up if curious) about these ideas, and someone dropped the link to this community. I love all this stuff about more organic and intuitive approaches to programming. Bret Victor is my personal hero, for context.

Hi everyone! I have just posted this question to hackernews and got to the frontpage. One of the comments suggested this channel but I don't really know anyone. (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20431879">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20431879</a>)<br/><br/>I am 26, have a BSc in computers science. I did not go further to MSc, because I deeply felt my university does not emphasize the right things. Eg. we barely learned about FP and nothing on Dependent Types, but my interest was always to write the cleanest and most expressive code possible.<br/><br/>I tried to look up and search many things in the last years: OOP, Uncle Bobs Clean Code series, classic GoF Design Patterns, DCI Architecture, Prolog and Logic programming, UML, Statecharts, reading on FP &amp; Type Systems, research on Temporal Logic and model validation, TDD, property based testing, using (runtime) assertions to reason, Eiffel and Design By Contract. None of these made me happy, I always felt something is just missing. My intuition said it is closely related to logic, reasoning, and boolean "tagging" of values/objects as "properties" (how to model odd/even numbers), the support of incremental implementation of code, plus a huge one: some help/reasoning on ordering of computations: aka taming async code which might get complicated really quickly... and of course some neat IDE support for that: neat "views" to focus on different but related parts of the implemented code and study their relations with or without other logic statements already coded up.<br/><br/>2 years ago I have found a youtube video on Idris and Dependent Types from Edward Brady and I was fascinated. I've seen the "properties" part I was looking for, the holes in code and some awesome self-written definitions, awesome case split. I googled Dependent Types, I have found Agda, Coq and Idris, checked some videos about them, but I was not sure if they are what I am really looking for or is there something more. This lead me to write the Ask HN post I mentioned above, I wanted to make sure I am not missing anything before investing in learning Dependent Types.<br/><br/>After reading the comments and connecting some dots I think the main intuitions I had are addressed exactly by Dependent Types, but I am really curious about further/other ideas what are going on, plus to join to a community who might use these tools.<br/><br/>I am wondering about the jobs and the fit of Dependent Types for my personal projects. I am a game developer now (Unity), but before that I used React / React Native, I am really interested in bindings with these technologies, but maybe it is not even necessary. I'd really happy to learn about real world options, how/where to use DT to make some money.

Hi, I’ve listened to a few episodes of the podcast (found it via the episode with Hillel), and hanging out on the slack for a few weeks. In my day job, I work on an actively developed, but 18 year old (and very creaky) code base of a few million lines, which has helped give me an interest in automated refactoring and static analysis. I have some vague ideas for making those tools easy to write. I also have a project in progress for an IDE facility to fuzz a function and display input-output pairs that exercise different branches: <a href="https://github.com/hyperpape/quicklook">https://github.com/hyperpape/quicklook</a> (that’s just the core fuzzing facility, the IDE integration is a work in progress).

Hey :wave: I've been enjoying the future of coding podcast for a while and some of the episodes get me really excited (hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tudor Girba</span>!). After programming german card games for over ten years I'm now working on making computational research explorable at <a href="http://nextjournal.com">nextjournal.com</a>. Bret Victor has been a big influence for the project, especially his climate change article. After never even looking at a LISP because of a distaste for it's parens we've finally discovered and learnt to love Clojure and we're now using it across the whole stack. I'll also be at Papers We Love in London on sunday and Curry On next week. Please say hello if you're also around!

Hi all, invited by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span> after I contacted him about his Onex project I found a few months ago. From my interest in astronomy, found <a href="http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/futurelang.php">http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/futurelang.php</a> and Lojban, then Clean. As a basic/assembler/c++ coder, I discovered functional programming. Then I looked for LISP, quickly found Erlang, then Racket. My latest discoveries are Picat and Elm (and perhaps Pyret). Always had a problem with programming language verbosity, how much "useless" lines have to be input before getting actual things done. Java someone ? Anyway, thinking about my own programming language for years now, something more about declarative programming (Picat) but that can be also edited visually. Hence my interest in Onex and TreeSheets (from <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Wouter van Oortmerssen</span> ). I really like the spreadsheet representation that can already be found in property sheets, close to data base editing. Wanna add data ? Add columns/rows. Wanna change the code ? Add more formulas. And the underlying code is still textual and can be edited using a terminal and/or refactored/analyzed using standard tools. I'd like to avoid the culprit programming languages such like Labview of Windev that needs a proprietary, complex and heavyweight IDE to edit/compile the code. My main aim is ai, db and embedded coding. I like easy prototyping languages like Python, interpreted and/or fast to compile, easy to debug. Also greatly interested/influenced by Bret Victor's work on real-time feedback user interfaces. So, here I am, and thanks for the invitation.

Hi everyone! I found out about this slack via <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> on twitter (thank you!) I'm currently on a break from consulting to focus on a personal project that's been cooking in my head for the past 5 years. It's a predictive, end-user programmable (forth-like), on-screen keyboard with variable key count (1–N) for use with assistive devices, smartphones, and VR input devices like tapwithus. Happy to learn from such a great community :)

Hello! I stumbled across a mention of this Slack on Twitter and it seemed very aligned to my interests :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>I'm particularly interested in live programming and developer experience, so I write a lot of lisp and I've been slowly teaching myself smalltalk/pharo.<br/><br/>For my day I work on Hack, the programming language that powers Facebook. We spend a lot of time thinking about type systems on big codebases, so sometimes I'm thinking about static types, and other times I think about dynamic types.

Hi all! Longtime follower and recent contributor on the “robust first” computing effort with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dave Ackley</span>. My background is working in the industry on large software systems. I’m determined to build life-like robustness into a new computing stack. As a concrete analogy: I like to think of how primitive cellular functions build upon each other to achieve higher level goals. This could be similar to how traditional software functions are composed today. The best part is we get to start from scratch. Removing billions of years of cruft :-) we can build crisp and predictable functions with good reuse. That’s part of the fun and challenge of this work, and we’re definitely still at the beginning. Would love to get to know you all and answer questions!<br/><br/>Edit: I hang out in: #robust-computation and <a href="http://gitter.im/t2tile/">http://gitter.im/t2tile/</a> is where most of the real work happens.

Hello everyone! My name is Joel and I was directed here by an acquaintance who felt I’d fit in with this crowd. :slightly_smiling_face: I would consider myself as someone who’s relatively young in the PL space but have just as much love and respect for the field as any veteran out there. I’m primarily interested in Term Rewriting, Pattern Matching/Substitution, and Symbolic programming. For the past few years I’ve been developing a library in Clojure to do “real programming” heavily based on those interests. I believe there’s tremendous benefit in bringing TR concepts into mainstream software engineering, technical and social.

This has involved defining a progress measure for a computation in terms of an information-gain game between the system and the logic/environment, and an adaptive evaluation procedure based on trying to maximize performance in this game. More concretely, it's a probabilistic relational language written in Julia that uses ideas from game tree search to learn to do well at that game. The main strategy for optimizing is finding highly informative inference paths connecting facts to queries, which are essentially dataflows, so I got some ideas about a dataflow-oriented but still general purpose VM/hardware which I'm calling the Route Machine and which I think might synergize quite well with the Movable Feast Machine ideas. Looking forward to discussing more.<br/>I also enjoyed a quick look at the podcast backlog and am keen on taking in more of the culture. I've been a bit dry since Lambda the Ultimate declined in activity.

Hi folks.  I'm here at the invitation of David Broderick, who liked a "Future of Programming" video I did a few years ago.  I started coding on the IBM 1130 in the early '70s and my first programming language stuff was doing the code generator for (what became) the "Sargasso C" compiler for TOPS-10/-20 in the late '70s.  I did machine learning in the '80s, artificial life and distributed systems in the '90s, and biological approaches to computer security in the '00s.  Since about 2008 I've been on a mission to develop a computer architecture that abandons the assumption of hardware determinism and instead embraces best-effort throughout a reinvented computational stack.  The resulting "Movable Feast Machine" looks like a cellular automata on steroids and we are only at the beginnings of developing basic structures and programming paradigms for it.

Hey all. I just finished a PhD in programming languages at Northeastern in Boston, and I'm now working at Google here in the Boston area. I'd like to find more ways to make software development easier, so I'm very interested to learn more about this community

Hi everyone, I found this group recently through a HN comment / Steve’s site, and have been very much enjoying following all the great conversations going on here! My academic background is maths, so I’m not super strong on the compsci theoretical side, but I learnt coding from my dad, and then through doing dev work for charities for some years I stumbled into many similar beliefs to those expressed here. In particular I’m very interested in the ‘coding for non-coders’ endeavour, e.g. FRP, excel-like systems, user empowerment etc. I’ve been working on a new language in this vein over the past year, and am excited to see what you guys think - I’ll share in the feedback channel :slightly_smiling_face:

Hello everyone.<br/>I found Steve Krouse’s podcast, and then to this Slack. In my day job I’m a developer evangelist for Mixed Reality at Mozilla, but I’ve had programming languages and usability as a passion of mine for many years. A lot stems from my belief that the best technology is something which empowers people to solve their own problems.  The computer was supposed to be “the bicycle for the mind”, and yet it’s getting less hackable and customizable over time.  There is such enormous potential in providing programmability to people who are experts in something other than programming.<br/><br/>Also, I think there has to be a better way to program computers than ascii text stored on disk. Surely when we build the Starship Enterprise in 300 years it won’t still have a command line in it. Right? :slightly_smiling_face:

Hi!<br/><br/>Consider a 3D animated character. How to build one such that it moves by itself? Then, how to make it such as it becomes a proxy for you to express your emotions and experiences, as quickly as possible, with as little indirection as possible?<br/><br/>My interest in programming and computer as a medium comes from these first set of questions. My name is Achraf ("ash-rough"), I live in Morocco, and I have a background in visual arts, philosophy, and cognitive science. I worked in 3D visualization, web programming, and user interface design. More info on my website: <a href="https://www.achrafkassioui.com/">https://www.achrafkassioui.com/</a><br/><br/>I follow a lot of people in this group. Kudos to all of you who share and communicate your work.

Hi y'all. Just joined after <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Gregor</span> mentioned this slack to me :wave::skin-tone-2:. It seemed like the place I should be while I think hard about how to solve today's challenges of web coding &amp; design in my role as Product Manager for :fire::fox_face::hammer_and_wrench: Firefox DevTools.<br/><br/>My goals are to make devs more productive and guide their work to create an open, fast &amp; compatible web, accessible to everyone. I like to explore topics around logging, step debugging, logpoints/tracepoints, time travel debugging :male-scientist::skin-tone-3:, remote debugging, worker debugging, etc. (If you are interested in exploring DevTools, discussing ideas with the team or following development, we got <a href="https://devtools-html-slack.herokuapp.com/)">https://devtools-html-slack.herokuapp.com/)</a> .

Hello all. My name is Rashad Gover and I’m a second year college student in L.A. I’m primarily interested in functional programming, logic programming, denotational semantics, PLT, type theory, applied category theory, and the formal verification of programs. My main goals are to improve the ergonomics of programming languages, come up with methods for mathematically proving the correctness of programs, and come up with better ways of teaching programming and computer science. I am still new to a lot of this stuff so I look forward to learning a lot from the more experienced members of this group. I look forward to doing 1-on-1’s with some of you:grin: Cheers to the future of coding:beers:

Hello all. I figure it’s time I should formally introduce myself. I’m a programmer in Virginia who’s eagerly looking for the future of coding. My dream is to unlock the power of computing for non-programmers. I’ve seen this done particularly well in Dynamics CRM, Microsoft Excel, and in the now-abandoned Eve language. I’m particularly interested in logic programming, query languages (like Datalog), and the semantic web, so naturally I pay close attention to Dustin Getz’ Hyperfiddle project. Clojure is my weapon of choice, but I’m developing an appreciation for static types and the expressivity they bring, and am interested in exploring formal methods and dependently-typed languages like Idris. I also have an avid interest in how philosophy bears on computation, and how a humane philosophy can work itself out into humane software. I’m very grateful to have found this group. Here’s to the future of coding :clinking_glasses:

Hi there! I'm Sébastien and am currently based in Montréal (moving to Wellington, NZ in a few months). I've been interested in PL design since late 90s and have created a few transpilers ([Sugar](<a href="https://github.com/sebastien/sugar">https://github.com/sebastien/sugar</a>), [Sugar 2](<a href="https://github.com/sebastien/sugar2">https://github.com/sebastien/sugar2</a>), [PAML](<a href="https://github.com/sebastien/paml">https://github.com/sebastien/paml</a>), [PCSS](<a href="https://github.com/sebastien/pcss]">https://github.com/sebastien/pcss]</a> as well as underlying tools/libraries like [LambdaFactory](<a href="https://github.com/sebastien/lambdafactory">https://github.com/sebastien/lambdafactory</a>) and [Libparsing](<a href="https://github.com/sebastien/libparsing">https://github.com/sebastien/libparsing</a>)). My background is primarily in software engineering, but I also have studied design and have worked at the intersection of both creating interactive data-visualizations and data-rich interfaces at [FFunction](<a href="https://ffctn.com">https://ffctn.com</a>)<br/><br/>I'm currently working on two PL-related projects at the moment: Curved, a visual editor for the Curv Language by Doug Moen (who's also on this forum) and TLang, a language for incremental tree processing to build compilers, build systems, reactive user interfaces, databases and other applications that rely heavily on a graph structure.<br/><br/>I'm very interested in the topics of visual programming and how programming languages/paradigms shape our mental model, and I'm particularly interested in the technical topics of parsing, abstract program model/program representation and data structure synthesis (all of which, you can guess, are quite useful in building modern compilers!).

Hi everyone! I've listened to a couple episodes of the podcast but I've been interested in the future of software development for quite a few years. I've been fascinated by the ideas Bret Victor talks about ever since I saw his talks, and I've been working on bringing together some of his ideas and others together into a new type of software development platform. This seems like a great place to discuss these ideas and learn new concepts too!

Hi everyone! I just signed to this group after listening to my third episode of <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span>'s podcast (with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span>). I don't consider myself a programmer, but as an advanced computer user. I write code for my own use (quite a bit), and I also share my code and contribute to collective developments, but I never write code that I wouldn't use myself.

Hi! I’m Ian (but you could tell that already), from Minneapolis.<br/><br/>I’m particularly interested in programming environments – for instance, notebook interfaces seem like the most notable programming exploration of the moment. But the specific project I’ve been mulling over and experimenting with is using fully automated testing (like fuzzing) of interactive applications to collect execution information to support the programmer. I imagine a system where you can get a map of what the application actually does (intentional or not), and then you can explore down into <em>why</em> it does those things.<br/><br/>But it’s a side project, so maybe more dream than reality, but I’m sure I’m not alone :wink:

i am working myself on something that would be ideal for coding camps, and i look forward to the field test where i test it on 12 year olds and 70 year olds. Both groups are excluded at present, and the seniors have the most to offer because they know what should be built, while kids typically only know games.

welcome to the group. There is no question that better languages can drastically simplify programming, and that a much larger number of personality types can enjoy programming once this grand simplification occurs. I find at present, programming is restricted to people who could do a 5000 piece jigsaw puzzle. That takes a very special kind of persistence, patience, and strong pattern recognition skills. Most puzzles sold are in the 300 / 500 / 1000 piece sizes, and many stores don't even stock a 5000 piece jigsaw.

Hi, all! My name is Nathan Schulzke. I first started programming as a 10-year-old with a copy of Macromedia Flash. Building silly Flash games as a pre-teen doesn't look like much of an educational experience to typical modern educators, but I firmly attribute my success in learning math, logic, and linguistics to early experiments in programming. Because coding was so foundational for me, it has always been surprising and disappointing how few kids get into programming, and how many CS college students find little to no enjoyment in it.<br/><br/>Two summers ago I taught at a coding camp, which proved to be a turning point for me. I was able to observe in others the same transformation that I went through upon learning programming. I watched kids who thought they were dunces realized they could make the computer do <em>anything</em>, which gave them hope and confidence that wasn't there before. But I also observed that the programming curriculum we were given actually got in they way of learning, and only the few kids who were able to ignore the curriculum actually learned to love to code.<br/><br/>This observation led me to read everything I could find on teaching programming to kids. I read Seymour Papert, Alan Kay, and Brett Victor, and a philosophy of programming education began to take shape. I began to feel that programming could be used to solve critical educational deficits in a lot of kids, if we can only lift our vision above the C-style programming model and treat computing as the wide and varied creative field it can be. I thought I was alone in this line of thinking until the Hillel Wayne podcast ended up on Hacker News. I'm thrilled to find a group so invested in all of my favorite authors, and am excited to learn more!

Hi :wave: I'm the founder of Storyscript, top-level language that seamlessly connects microservices and functions in a serverless way. Would love to connect with anyone who believes we need a much higher level language to define data-flow that moves data in a highly readable and intuitive way. :heart: OSS, We are hiring!, See thread for details.

Hi folks! I'm Pete. My background is as a fullstack developer, but I've become very interested in databases, since a lot of fullstack app development comes down to loading and saving data from the DB. I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/vilterp/treesql">https://github.com/vilterp/treesql</a>, a database which has GraphQL-inspired tree-structured queries, and pushes out updates to those queries when the underlying data changes.<br/><br/>I work at <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/">https://www.cockroachlabs.com/</a>, where I'm learning the craft of database architecture from some of the greats. A few years ago, I also made some contributions to the Elm time-travelling debugger (<a href="https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-reactor/pull/115">https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-reactor/pull/115</a>), so I have a soft spot for that project :slightly_smiling_face:

Hi, I'm Charlie, and I've just released the Strat Cloud Language ( <a href="https://strat.world/">https://strat.world/</a> ).  Strat is this odd thing that connects functions together within the cloud and lets users represent services and events at a very high level.  I've just found my way here and I'm starting to poke around.  As silly as it may be, I believe Strat, or other languages like it will play a big part in "the future of coding".  Let me know what you think!  Also, I built Strat's compiler in flat, (mostly) dependency-less Javascript, so if you want some deranged hot takes and poor technology evaluations, I'm your guy.

Hello, I’m the CEO of <a href="http://www.hyperfiddle.net/">http://www.hyperfiddle.net/</a> which is a FOC startup currently based in Philadelphia. Hyperfiddle basically takes the Clojure/Datomic information model and extends it through to user interfaces. While the technology is interesting, we think a large part of the work is forming a strategy to get adoption at scale (a smooth path from 0 to 1 to 100 to 100k) and also figuring out an economic model to fund the work.<br/><br/>We are bullish on Clojure because Clojure satisfies the criteria of “smooth adoption path” and has a lot of deeply interesting properties, such as the cost of porting Clojure to a new platform is within about a man-year of effort. Clojure on N platforms makes it possible to build distributed systems across platforms with shared information model, data structures and code. A unified/holistic model. So while Clojure is certainly not perfect, it is designed for real-world usage and makes practical compromises to achieve growth. We see Hyperfiddle as just one component of a self-organizing movement which is larger than any one project or company funding 100% of the work.

Hi all, I am an art historian turned philosopher and historian of computing – . I was lucky enough to get a permanent research position at a time when I was starting to despair a bit and still feel as one of the most lucky persons when I realize I have this job. It gave me a new kind of freedom which I didn’t have in previous academic positions; and it took me quite a while to realize that.  I am very much engaged with retracing and rendering transparent through history where we are now with computing technology – as so many others; I worry a lot about this broad and disconnected field; I very much like an approach of asking rather basic questions (I guess that is the philosopher in me) which, at first sight, almost seem trivial but once one starts to dig a bit, seem to be quite hard. One main question I am currently focusing on is: What is a (computer) program? This is the guiding question of a research project I am coordinating and which involves historians, philosophers, computer scientists and some programmers. Note: the choice for "program" and not software; code; algorithm; etc is not arbitrary – I think it kind of comprises/implied these other notions. If anyone of you might be interested in this or anything else that is losely or strictly related to history and philosophy of computing and programs, please do share your thoughts/concerns/etc with me. Also: I am currently starting to collect answers from as many people as possible to the main question above and I would be happy to receive some from you too – best wishes, L

Hello, folks. I'm an electrical-turned-embedded engineer focused on remote, low-power monitoring and control systems, mostly in the developing world. I've got an interest in dependable and high-reliability system designs; mainly because the majority of devices using my work are extremely hard to access and update if maintenance is required, so 'pushing an OTA fix' is often out of the question. I've got an interest in applying tools and research to improve the reliability of both designs and delivered software. Some recently interesting examples are Rust, TLA+, and Frama-C.<br/><br/>I got turned on to "Future of Coding" via the Hillel Wayne podcast on formal specifications, and now I'm here. Cheers!

Hello everyone! PhD student in CS but have been coding for around 15 years. I've done hundreds of things as I was always "following the new trends" during all this time. As of today, I'm very into JIT compilers and WebAssembly, also my PhD is on Scientific Visualization with an application to Biology. These days I'm going through some kind of early-adult-life crisis, I had a daughter 3 years ago and that changed my perspective on life completely. I used to be a very chill person and didn't worry about "monetizing" my career. Now I have bills to pay and I want to find ways to turn my talent into profit. This has been very difficult as my network is mostly scientists and we are very disconnected from /the real world/. I've tried to join some university incubators but had no success (I could tell the story later). I'm mainly looking to network with people to either 1. get into a new venture/startup and help getting it off the ground or 2. find a nice job to go to after I finish my PhD. Don't hesitate to message me if you want to talk about pretty much anything (I read a lot about many things, not only science related). I've been reading HN (and other stuff) daily since 2009, so if you just want to talk industry gossip is cool for me. Also greetings everyone :smile:!

Hi everyone. I'm Carlo Kok And just curious about this Community. I work on a commercial compiler as my main job. Specifically c#, pascal, swift, go and java for .net, jvm, android, iOS, Macos and a native backend based on llvm. Atm I'm just here to see if there's any worthwhile ideas I know about and share later.

Hi everyone, I'm David Broderick.  Originally from northern California, I spent 20 years in Europe (mainly Switzerland, Czech Republic and most recently southern France) and I'm currently living in Boise, Idaho.<br/>I used to be part of the 2020 group in San Francisco which has similar discussions and is paired with the Future of Programming meetups in the Bay Area (<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Future-of-Programming">https://www.meetup.com/Future-of-Programming</a>).  My big, long-term project is called Kayia which is an attempt to layer the spreadsheet model onto a declarative language, if that makes any sense.  I would link to the site for that, but since it's undergoing a lot of changes, it just has a stub for now.   I'm looking forward to joining in on the discussions!

Hi everyone! I'm a mathematician of a similar age as <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span> and have programmed since the tail end of the punched card era, mostly at a low level - digging myself upwards from designing and building assemblers, debuggers, compilers, and interpreters to graphical editors (2D and 3D), to web design (frontend and backend).<br/><br/>I taught Maths and then Computer Science at a Cambridge, UK sixth form and saw the introduction of the BBC Micro. This led me eventually to quitting teaching and writing software for the first ARM-based computer (the Acorn Archimedes) having borrowed one for a weekend to port the virtual machine for an APL interpreter (which could also run on the BBC Micro).<br/><br/>The (minimal) original website for my company is still up and running (<a href="http://www.acecomp.demon.co.uk/">http://www.acecomp.demon.co.uk/</a>) and there's a brief mention of some earlier work on the Binary Dinosaurs site (<a href="http://www.binarydinosaurs.co.uk/Museum/icl/tcheal.php">http://www.binarydinosaurs.co.uk/Museum/icl/tcheal.php</a>). My company merged with two other small UK software houses who produced a HyperCard-like programming system (Genesis) for the Archimedes. I am currently employed by an NLP specialist - designing a new web-based front-end for their product. I have also recently been teaching CS again, now that the UK syllabus has returned to something more like the one I taught in the 1980s.<br/><br/>I have been working on attempts to improve programming itself for about 25 years, mostly due to a random thought in about 1993 which means I can no longer program without thinking "This could be a lot easier..." every time I hit a key. I've set myself a deadline for September to produce something a bit more public, as a self-imposed incentive. I've probably now gone down most dead-ends, so I'm hoping that failure experience will eventually pay off.

Hi everyone! My name is Nicolas and I live in Toulouse, France.<br/><br/>I love coding since I first try it (maybe at 11) and do it for a living for more than twenty years (as a computer scientist and a scientist in remote sensing imaging). I like discovering and experimenting new things in computer science. My recent interests are WebAssembly, Vue.js and Rust. Several years ago I cofound "la Compagnie du Code", an organization in Toulouse that organizes workshops to give childrens the opportunity to code and practice creative computing and computationnal thinking. My main tool for that is MIT's Scratch.<br/><br/>I am convinced that for now programming is a uneccessary complicated and I am wondering how this activity can evolve to permit more people to do it, even those that are not professionnal programmers but that can benefit from a bit of programming every now and then. My guess is that one key thing to bring more people to code is visual coding. So I am here, maybe because on my search on visual programming resources I once heard of Bret Victor, then later found some reference to him in "Future of Coding" and find this initiative very inspiring! :slightly_smiling_face: I know I have <b>lots</b> of stuff to read and discuss to learn what people have expermients in that field...<br/><br/>So my vision is a visual coding platform on top of web standards. I know there are lots of visual programming semantics that have been invented/experimented since several decades, and it is not new to try to bring people to programming this way, and none has really succeeded (some more than others, but none has became a standard or is widely used). But I am convinced that there is some stuff to experiment! I have started to read some content of <a href="http://futureofcoding.org">futureofcoding.org</a> and what I have read so far is very close to my vision, in particular in <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/about#mission">https://futureofcoding.org/about#mission</a> where lots of points I should have wrote myself, except that I focus less on low level language, which is important, but for me the first step is the visual parts.<br/><br/>To conclude, I hope my trip in this slack and with the "Future of Coding" community will make me challenge my thoughts, discover some new inspiring visions and people, and experiment more on that field!

Happy to be here. I'm an Oracle database developer and have been sort of stuck in this niche for about 20 years. I do web development with Oracles newly rebranded low code tool called Application Express (Apex for short but not to be confused with Salesforce).<br/><br/>I find I keep coming back to ideas around better languages, better tools, and developer experience and somehow found this group last night. For me it seems like we are swimming in place and I guess I feel like I'm smart enough to want to find a way out of this mouse maze and into a better one.

Good morning and hello all. My name is Jason Priestley, I'm a bay area software developer. I have one big idea for the future of software. It's hard to describe because it either sounds vague or trivial or incomprehensible depending on how I describe it, so I'll describe it in a few ways, and perhaps the sum will give a better sense of things.<br/><br/>My idea is to unify programmer and user. Seen from the programmer's side, this means an IDE that provides the discoverability and rich graphical UI that user's enjoy. Seen from the user's side, this means that their walled-garden "apps" are now part of one big app, they are unknowingly editing code by clicking buttons, and there is a smooth transition between graphical UI and code.<br/><br/>My idea is to bring the Lisp REPL into the graphical era. Read and Print are text-based primitives. The modern equivalent is a graphical UI that can extend and edit itself. The extension method may resemble Reader macros, but instead of taking over Read at certain syntax, it takes over the whole UI.<br/><br/>My idea is to make data into code. Lisp made code into data - a function declaration is also a linked list. Data into code means that whenever you are operating on data - editing a TODO list say - you are literally editing code in one big program. Editing your TODO list is a specialized UI that does the exact same thing as opening the TODOs variable in your code editor and typing out your changes manually.<br/><br/>My idea is to make a universal editor. Instead of one editor and many apps you have one editor that can be changed and customized to take on any behavior.<br/><br/>My idea is to complete the idea behind Emacs. People joke that Emacs is an OS, that you can do anything in Emacs. I take these jokes seriously. An extensible editor should be our OS, but emacs is too ad-hoc and too tied to text buffers to really suffice. Emacs, but the primitive operations are more low-level UI constructs, and graphical from the start.

I'm excited to meet someone who worked at Intentional Software! I've watched videos of Charles Simonyi talk about links in code being stored as strong references, and about generative programming. I don't think think those concepts are foreign to this community, but I was very excited to see a real company (Intentional) formed around doing programming that way. I look forward to whatever insights you can find and provide in this community.

Hey folks, I'm Jeremy. I'm based in Ottawa, ON, Canada. Been listening to the podcast off and on for a while, don't remember how I found it.<br/>I've been programming since I was 4 years old using BASIC on a Commodore Vic-20. My career as a developer has been kind of all over the map, but the relevant detail for this crowd is that I got very excited about DSLs in the early 2000s and went to work at Intentional Software for five and a half years (2006-2011).<br/>I also run a game-making community at <a href="http://glorioustrainwrecks.com">glorioustrainwrecks.com</a>, where the guiding ethos is to be creative and expressive without gatekeeping or judgement about your choice of tools, game mechanics, or subject matter. Tiny, weird, and personal games are the norm, to the extent there is a norm. Hyper-accessible game-making tools like Klik &amp; Play and Twine deserve to be talked about in the same breath as Hypercard IMO.<br/>In general, my main interest at this point is empowering ordinary people; computing should be understandable, accessible, personal, collaborative, and in the direct control of the people who use it. When I was a kid, I was surrounded by tools that were designed to be learnable by people who had never touched a keyboard, and resources that encouraged me that understanding computers was not only possible, but fun and rewarding. To the extent that improving programming can advance that goal, I am on board.

Heyya! I'm Rainer. I'm from all over :earth_africa: but currently in Sierra Leone :flag-sl: I found you by going down the "What happened to Eve?" google-path. I would like to build a literate programming app centered around a journal / research log that's always just a keystroke away and tracks my activities to document my thought process (will probably be tightly integrated into the OS). I'm also super interested in learning / Spaced Repetition (especially enumerating "requirements/dependencies" for any lesson, to find a shortest path to a new piece of knowledge.) I'll probably just lurk here for a while, but will hopefully have some prototypes to show you some day.

:wave: I'm Vitorio, found this place from an HN comment.  I'm a UX designer and user researcher by day, but I've got Bret Victor's 2014 CDG research agenda tacked up on my wall, and I think there are a lot more intersections between this sort of work and more qualitative knowledge work (like user research) than is being broadly pursued.  I wrote up some early armchair Dynamicland commentary here: <a href="http://vitor.io/on-dynamicland">http://vitor.io/on-dynamicland</a> and followed it up on Jason Brennan's forum here: <a href="http://discuss.nearthespeedoflight.com/t/dynamicland/86/9">http://discuss.nearthespeedoflight.com/t/dynamicland/86/9</a> (thoughts gratefully welcomed!)

Hello, World! I'm Wouter van Oortmerssen and I've made a few programming languages (<a href="http://strlen.com/programming-languages/">http://strlen.com/programming-languages/</a>) probably the most futuristic being Aardappel (graphical distributed tree rewriting by example, <a href="http://strlen.com/aardappel-language/">http://strlen.com/aardappel-language/</a>) and Restructor (fully automatic whole program refactoring, also graphical, <a href="http://strlen.com/restructor/">http://strlen.com/restructor/</a>). My main project right now is a more conventional language, Lobster, that nevertheless has some innovation (e.g. flow sensitive type specialization, automatic lifetime analysis, FRP-like frame variables etc, <a href="http://strlen.com/lobster/)">http://strlen.com/lobster/)</a>. On the sillier side I once caused an esolang revival with <a href="http://strlen.com/false-language/">http://strlen.com/false-language/</a>. Oh and in my day job I work on LLVM and WebAssembly :slightly_smiling_face: Also make games and game engines, and productivity tools like TreeSheets.

Hi Everyone,<br/><br/>It was great to meet some of you today at the SF/Dynamicland meetup. While I've<br/>been on Slack for a bit, I never posted to introductions so here it is.<br/><br/>I'm a software engineer professionally and over time I've grown increasingly<br/>dissatisfied with the general state of affairs. It was all fun and games for a<br/>while, but then I started watching Alan Kay videos :smile:. While digging into<br/>historical ideas and banging my head against what seem to be a hard ceiling in<br/>many of the tools and systems we use, I've arrived at the position that there is<br/>a large space of possibilities that has been left unexplored while we continue<br/>to incrementally hammer away at the entrenched systems. I believe big leaps can<br/>only happen if many established fundamental ideas are changed or replaced. For<br/>instance, we store and share <b>information</b> by encoding it in a<br/>non-introspectable, very low level medium (aka files) that also loses its<br/>connections to related information, history and identity. We then redesign these<br/>features over and over in various ways in different contexts. Programs as text<br/>files is another poor representation. We re-implement the same functionality and<br/>schemas in different siloed processes and services. It seems our language for<br/>interconnection and scaling up is really poor. Much of programming deals with<br/>stuff that isn't really computing anything but just dealing with represenation<br/>changes (e.g. parsing - doesn't change the information content). Worse, this<br/>type of represenation shuffling code is tightly intermingled with the computing<br/>code. We sit in front of powerful computers, and simulate them in our heads -<br/>humans are simulating the general purpose simulator.<br/><br/>So what's an alternative? I don't know but perhaps creating a new<br/>PL/DB/framework to fit in a PL/DB/framework shaped hole in the current mess may not<br/>help. We need to explore ideas that are holisitic, ground up rethinking of what<br/>computing is, how the space is partitioned into concepts and artifacts (note<br/>files/filesystems, OS processes, databases, 'programs', compilers etc. are all<br/>means to an end, serving the users achieve some of their goals - what are the<br/>goals and what other ways can they be expressed?). How does something like this<br/>'alternative substrate' or 'new material for computing' fit onto the existing<br/>world? It doesn't, but my interest is more of a research exercise - how can it<br/>be done, what would make it complete and self sustaining? If we have some good<br/>ideas, we can prototype. Since this is broad and can go in all directions, I've<br/>been writing to try and clear my thoughts and keep moving forward in some way.<br/>If you're interested take a look at <a href="https://shalabh.com/programmable-systems/">https://shalabh.com/programmable-systems/</a>

<em>(frantically throws together some kind of intro before heading to meet everyone at Dynamicland)</em><br/><br/>Hello there! I’m Yoz, a short bald Brit who lives in Oakland and works in SF. I’ve been lurking on this Slack for a while after enjoying a few episodes of Steve’s podcast. Some relevant bits of history:<br/>1. Ever since I first logged onto <b>LambdaMOO</b> in 1993, I’ve been obsessed with the potential for <b>shared programmable worlds</b>. This led me to 5 years working at <b>Linden Lab</b>, the creators/maintainers of <b>Second Life</b>, Blocksworld and Sansar, all of which are shared programmable worlds like MOO. It taught me a huge amount about the underestimated benefits and problems of these systems.<br/>2. I spent 4 years at <b>18F</b>, a consultancy within the US Government. It teaches departments about agile development &amp; procurement, user-centered design and open source, all with the aim of serving citizens better. Most of my time was spent both programming new systems and learning about legacy ones. <b>It convinced me that most of our software development was inherently a bad idea</b>, and that it would be better to build on no-code/low-code systems, and to focus on empowering staffers rather than automating their jobs away.<br/>3. I’m fascinated by debugging, with existing and new tools. I’ve given talks on debugging (see thread) and played around with creating new debugging tools.<br/>4. These days I’m something of a software pessimist, to the point where I’m not sure that we should be teaching kids to code at all - at least, not until we are able to sufficiently manage the complexity we create.<br/>5. I love amazing bug stories - see the thread for a couple, and also for my favourite computing paper.<br/><br/>Looking forward to meeting and chatting with folks!

Hi everyone! My name is Robin Allison. I want to understand stuff. I studied pure math in undergrad and grad school for a year. I studied math because I could get it and obsessed over algebraic topology because more than any other subject because I couldn't get it. That wasn't good for my career but its given me a unique perspective on math and I'm grateful for that. I read Michael Nielsen's essay "Reinventing Explanation" which eventually let me understand Bret Victor. I came to the conclusion that my understanding was limited by the representations we used, and that by inventing my own I could better understand.<br/><br/>I've had two personal victories, one with spectral sequences and one with the proof of the cellular boundary, in designing better representations using static media. I'm working on better representing the computation of the homology of the projective plane using the decomposition RP^2 = e^2 \cup e^1 \cup e^0, extending the previous techniques. I hope that these "prototypes" can convince other mathematicians the merits and unexplored possibilities of design, leaving aside the possibilities of dynamic media. Additionally I speculate heavily on how we interface with mathematical ideas, motivated by whats probably considered low working memory and expressive language capabilities for math.<br/><br/>In my experience it is extremely difficult to get other mathematicians to think about the kinds of ideas talked about here. I think part of the problem is that the solution is outside of math whereas for coding at least the solution is still code and has a historical basis in the work of Alan Kay etc.  So I hope I can hang out here until mathematics expands to consider "design" a part of math too. :slightly_smiling_face:

Hi Future of Coding Slack!<br/>I'm Christopher Schuster. I spent some time with Smalltalk and Lively, I was an intern at CDG/HARC and I also ended up working on live programming for my PhD studies at University of California, Santa Cruz. I recently finished my thesis which tries to somewhat bridge live programming and static program verification (you can read more at <a href="http://chris-schuster.net/thesis">chris-schuster.net/thesis</a>). I'm currently in the Bay Area.<br/><br/>I'm also a frequent listener of Future of Coding podcast and I'm joining this Slack channel to get some news and updates.

Hi people from the future,<br/><br/>I'm based in Portugal and I've started working at OutSystems 18 years ago, where we are approaching this opportunity space more from a business side, targeting medium-large companies. Historically it's been hard, as there has been a lot of push-back from the more technical crowd.<br/><br/>Recently industry analysts (Gartner, Forrester) have discovered there is a big market for these low-code solutions (thanks, in part, to our own effort), and we're riding that wave and have become an Unicorn.<br/><br/>We've always approached development from a user experience angle, and now we have more and more established usability practices that steer our IDE and our language.<br/><br/>Looking forward to learn and share, and for the critique of a group that has this subject in their hearts and minds.<br/><br/>We have a free version that can be tried out at <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/">https://www.outsystems.com/</a>

Hi everyone!<br/><br/>My name is Miguel Rochefort. I'm a software developer from Montréal, Canada. I've been traveling around Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Bali) for the past 6 months out of my 21-liter backpack.<br/><br/>I initially got into programming at age 10, when I built my first websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). At 12, I started played with Python and C++. At 16, it was Visual Basic and PHP. At 18, I started learning C#, which has been my main language for the past 10 years. I then discovered Haskell, Prolog, Lisp, Smalltalk, ML, Agda, Idris, Coq, Mercury, Eve, etc. That's when I got hooked on programming language design.<br/><br/>My main influences are Bret Victor, Alan Kay, Douglas Engelbart, Chris Granger, Ted Nelson, Tim Berners Lee, Jef Raskin, Steve Jobs, Stephen Wolfram, Charles Simonyi, David Allen, Mathias Duarte, etc. If I could travel back in time, I would go to Xerox PARC.<br/><br/>The current state of software is a mess. The incidental complexity is unbelievable. Nothing changed in the past 40 years. We must have reached a local maxima.<br/><br/>Here are some of my heuristics for the future of programming:<br/><br/>- Using software and creating software should feel the same.<br/>- 80% of people should be able to program without any formal training.<br/>- You should be productive when programming on a 5" phone (but the optimal interface should be VR or R).<br/>- Programming should not involve text files and syntax.<br/>- Programming by example (with direct manipulation) should be the dominant paradigm (WYSIWYG, TDD, ML dataset, Excel's Flash Fill).<br/>- The distinction between natural language, programming language and graphical user interface should disappear.<br/>- Programming is mainly a modeling problem.<br/>- Designing and implementing GUI by hand doesn't scale (especially once responsive design considers all of a user's preferences) and should be automated (e.g., Naked Objects).<br/>- The code to invoke a user (GUI) and the code to invoke a machine (API) should be identical.<br/>- Every function/predicate/model ever created should be instantly available to everyone.<br/>- Mechnical turks and AI functions should be as easy to call as a local function.<br/>- Fuzzy/bayesian values (e.g., "integer between 0 and 18") should be first class citizens, and automatically turn any deterministic functions into a fuzzy/probabilistic functions.<br/>- Strings should be avoided, and semantically richer types/ontologies (Email, PhoneNumber, Password, Country) should be used instead.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm experimenting with Quantified Self. I'm trying to collect as much information about my life as I can. This starts with IoT devices, wearables, NFC tags, QR codes, cameras, audio recorders, GPS trackers, keyloggers, IFTTT, manual input, etc. Then I have to manually/automatically classify/quantify the collected data, to extract computable meaning/semantics. Ultimately, I can visualize the data, query it, infer new knowledge, make lifestyle changes to affect the output, etc. The idea is that the more we know about a user, the less we need to ask it for input ("don't make me click") and the less assumptions about it we need to hard code in our code base. I believe this is the first step to make coding against a user as easy as coding against an API or a database.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to some great discussions!

Hi folks! I'm Ilari, a developer at a Finnish startup Valaa Technologies (colleague of Ville and Iridian above :point_up_2:). To be a bit grandiose: We're creating what could be called a new paradigm of web coding, called ValOS (Valaa Open System). In practice it isn't that different from all the black magic things that something like Meteor framework does (automatic live updates to all displayed data between multiple users, etc). But on the background, it is a deeper rethinking of the coding model (especially distribution of code, and the frontend/backend separation), instead of piling more and more stuff on top of current stacks. Anyway, we can discuss our thing more on the channels, but I think it was relevant to intro since it's very relevant for why I am here. Because what we are doing is is directly in the frontlines of the future of coding. I'm happy to talk about this more.<br/><br/>I've personally been coding from something like age of ten, and I've always been interested in experimenting with things. Professionally I've been a (full-stack) coder for approx. 7 years. I have an educational background in usability, and often call myself a human-geek interface. My personal passions, in addition to coding, are storytelling and games. Hopefully I'll manage to combine all these things at some point. Hopefully soon.<br/><br/>Currently the stuff I'm most interested in are the possibilities of ValOS resource model, combined with how quick code experimentation with ValOS is. As a coder, I want to both see and use immediate results instead of having to jump through hoops. If I hadn't encountered ValaaTech, I'd be doing similar experimentation with Meteor.

Hiya. I'm an entrepreneur partner of Ville's and the chief architect of ValOS base infrastructure. I'm more than happy to share deeper technicalities of the stack, but glad to leave Ville do most of the talking.<br/>I'm a generalist and a systems builder (with all the good and the bad that comes with it), and for me ValOS is an 'exercise' of pushing the envelope of 'Distributed CRUD Event Sourcing' on several fronts as a basis of interactive content sharing and execution environment. The vision crystallized already back in late 2016 and we were able to bootstrap our own IDE 'Zero' for developing itself in late 2017 - this is the point were it ceased to be an exercise but a real thing. While the design has always centered around the base technologies of JS, HTML5 and CSS (and always will be!), the underlying paradigm is quite different. This has meant having to reinvent more wheels than we'd like. But we're on the doorsteps of having a fully functional development ecosystem with all the necessary components in place. So even I am sticking my neck out and not have Ville do all the networking... :stuck_out_tongue:

Hi! everyone! I’m Ville Ilkkala from a Finnish startup called Valaa Technologies. We are working on an open source software development architecture called ValOS (Valaa Open System) that is based on sort of an direct manipulation programming and a globally distributed event sourcing mechanism that covers also the application source code, not just the data.<br/><br/>I am more of an prototype user / citizen developer and I have written my first full-stack applications with the ValOS platform (I never really got my head around existing web development stacks and suffered the most with back ends and databases). Others in our team are working on the core technology and the web IDE. My prior working history includes educational game design, interaction and concept design and other things going on <em>around</em> the code. Since getting my feet wet with programming I have also started teaching it to non-programmers using our platform.<br/><br/>I learned about <a href="http://futureofcoding.org">futureofcoding.org</a> last year when Steve sent me an bug report that our IDE doesn’t even start. :smile: He interviewed us last week and posted the video on #share-your-work.<br/><br/>The projects here seem super interesting and inspiring. I look forward to discussions, feedback and meeting new people. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>I'm most active in LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ville-ilkkala-1809b319/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ville-ilkkala-1809b319/</a>

I want to work on the foundations of programming and on interoperability, and I think my work is relevant to everyone here. Many researchers, for instance, have made experimental programming languages and environments - but they can't interoperate with each other! Many languages can only interoperate with C, one of the most archaic languages in existence!<br/><br/>We must break down these silo walls, so I want to work on those common foundations: to figure out a way to let you write a library in a language that will convert itself to several different languages and run easily on many platforms. To figure out how to standardize everything from point data types (X,Y coordinates), to D-style ranges (an abstraction for subsequences), to whatever data types neural networks are made of, to the way debuggers work. (current thinking: a StackOverflow-like site where people vote on interface designs?). In short, I want to solve the technical problems that create friction in both the niche of programming language design and in the broader world of software engineering. (But, as I say, no time, can't do it. It's funny to have enough urgent work to fill a lifetime, but treat it like a minor hobby to do on weekends sometimes.)<br/><br/>Oh and Bret Victor inspired me yada yada I invent on principle blah blah. Like the rest of y'all :slightly_smiling_face: But seriously, Bret Victor FTW.<br/><br/>Twitter: @DPiepgrass  Site: <a href="http://david.loyc.net">david.loyc.net</a>

I’ve been dreaming of making some sort of “ultimate programming language” for over 15 years—but to my surprise, never found any like-minded folks until recently. I registered <a href="http://loyc.net/">http://loyc.net/</a> in 2007 with the idea of making a democratically-extensible compiler with multiple input syntaxes; as time passed it morphed into a set of general ideas for language building. More concretely I wrote the C# parser generator LLLPG and the Lisp-inspired macro system it runs within (it's designed so that the same macro system could support any programming language, I just haven't had time to go beyond C#). But for this group the most relevant thing I've made is LESv2 and LESv3, two simple languages to represent universal syntax trees. I've worked a bit with Jonathan Van der Cruise who made Flame, a compiler-building framework for C#. I learned about Haxe just this year, but I've wanted to build something for several years that would let you write libraries targeting several languages at once. I think I could build something better than Haxe and Cito (Ć) - if only I had some funding and manpower. I’d also be interested in a system for bridging programming languages at run-time so they could communicate seamlessly. For now, I’m too busy at my new job to do anything, including hang out here! (truth be told it's a horrible job and I desperately wish to find something better.) I’ve been bursting with ideas for years and hate being unable to execute on them.<br/><br/>Links:<br/>• Loyc trees <a href="http://loyc.net/loyc-trees">http://loyc.net/loyc-trees</a><br/>• LES <a href="http://loyc.net/les">http://loyc.net/les</a> &lt;= Use this to prototype new programming languages<br/>• LLLPG <a href="http://ecsharp.net/lllpg">http://ecsharp.net/lllpg</a><br/>• LeMP <a href="http://ecsharp.net/lemp">http://ecsharp.net/lemp</a><br/>• Flame <a href="https://github.com/jonathanvdc/Flame">https://github.com/jonathanvdc/Flame</a><br/>• Haxe <a href="https://haxe.org">https://haxe.org</a>

Hi all :wave:<br/>I'm a developer based in Cambridge, UK. I discovered Future of Coding thanks to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Woods</span> and especially liked the episode about React history with Pete Hunt. I currently code in TypeScript and Swift, but I've done my first more or less serious coding in my life in Scheme and Tcl. Also had a bit of production experience with Haskell as well. I see there are mentions of music interests and visual programming here, and both topics are quite interesting to me. In my spare time I like poking modular synthesisers in something like Audulus (<a href="http://audulus.com">http://audulus.com</a>)<br/><br/>I'm currently building a framework inspired by React in pure Swift. I was very excited when React Hooks were announced, so I decided to drop the class-based API altogether and only implement a Hooks API. I still need to implement a few more hooks and host components, but I hope I'm much closer to a point where it can be used for real iOS apps and some other platforms in the future, when more renders are added. You can check out my current progress here if you're interested: <a href="https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/Gluon">https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/Gluon</a><br/>If this thing gets any traction, I'd like to build visual developer tools for it in the future.<br/><br/>Thanks for the podcast and the community, super excited to learn more from you all!

Hello all! I’ve been hanging around this community since I attended the first London meetup, so it’s probably about time I introduced myself. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>I’m an Australian software developer currently working as a contractor in London and looking forward to working in other global cities in the future. Was fortunate enough to discover computers around age 12, got my first paid development job at 15 (couldn’t believe that I could get paid to do something I already enjoy!) and never looked back. Worked with various languages, projects and stacks. These days it’s Typescript, Javascript, Rx and C#. Maybe (hopefully!) Scala in the near future.<br/><br/>My formal education is a bit scant, but I’ve reading up and doing courses here and there. Some books I really enjoyed were ‘A Philosophy of Software Design’ (Outsterhout), ‘Code Complete’ (McConnel) and ‘Design Patterns’ (GOF). And this community has also been a fount of resources.<br/><br/>I constantly feel like a beginner with software, and maybe it’ll be that way for life, but I still want to advance my knowledge.<br/><br/>I’m especially interested in the craft of coding, the construction of software and systems and the intersection of design and programming. My biggest weakness is fear &amp; ignorance of math, but I’m slowly chipping away at that.<br/><br/>I’m very fond of certain kinds of music that have a systematic and/or cyclic element to them. I especially love the symphonies of Anton Bruckner, which seem to have an organic complexity and depth that I get totally lost in.<br/><br/>Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> &amp; <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> and all of you. Let’s get it started in here! B-)

Hi, I'm Duncan,<br/><br/>I'm building <a href="https://thorny.io">https://thorny.io</a>, an interactive notebook for decision making.<br/>I want to help engineers tackle overwhelming design, planning and strategy problems where multiple decisions are tangled together.<br/><br/>The end goal is not a programming tool but it is still an end-user computation problem because at their most general level, decisions, plans and reasoning, are actually types of computation.<br/><br/>The underlying structure is a knowledge graph which includes possibilities and reasoning (similar to syntax tree).<br/>Like a spreadsheet, if you change the reasoning, decisions or beliefs, then the consequences ripple through the graph.<br/>The UI I have been exploring is<br/>- an outliner (effectively a structure editor for a reasoning notation)<br/>- with spreadsheet power (it supports formulas that reference other parts of the knowledge graph)<br/>The demos on the site are out of date and baffling, I will update them with the current version shortly!<br/><br/>I am based in Bristol UK. I studied CompSci at Cambridge and was previously head of software at an engineering firm building various design and optimization tools for engineers. I am interested in the typical Brett Victor topics plus:<br/>- non-monotonic reasoning<br/>- belief networks<br/>- logic programming<br/>- argument mapping<br/>- optimization and solvers<br/><br/>I have also built various compilers, code generation and visualization tools.<br/>I want to work more in the open and share more but I find it tough.<br/>I am so impressed with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> and this community, I have so much to learn here!

hi team!<br/>I've been following <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> for a while.. and now is the time to join.<br/><br/>My thesis and my team's is that everyone should have access to general purpose computation, so that they can unlock data and processes that only they can customize. Our approach is to package the basic ingredients (logic, I/O, clocks, persistence and "databases") into the functions of the cells of a spreadsheet. Like lego.<br/><br/>My initial thinking on the matter started a few years back (<a href="https://www.patife.com/entries/9/">https://www.patife.com/entries/9/</a>).<br/>We're launching in a couple of weeks at <a href="http://dashdash.com">dashdash.com</a>. we're a 2-year old startup where i'm a product owner and CEO in a great team of 24.<br/><br/>so far we have built<br/>- the regular excel functions like vlookup(), min(), max(), etc (same names, syntax, types and coercion)<br/>- new: web functions like get(), post(), and integrations that give you send_sms() and more<br/>- new: automation with repeat(  , period)<br/>- new: side effects with insert() and update() for table-to-table operations.<br/>You can find a video of an example of what we do here <a href="https://twitter.com/patife/status/1086345026643394560">https://twitter.com/patife/status/1086345026643394560</a><br/><br/>I hope to get feedback on our product and explore how to <em>translate</em> programming for non-techies, which functions to build, and how to avoid people taping into dangerous resources. you can follow me at <a href="https://twitter.com/patife/">https://twitter.com/patife/</a>

Hey'all, I've been hovering this Slack for a few months and wanted to wait with introducing myself until I have something to show. But since I just keep pushing the date, I'll cut the crap and say hi: Hi :wave: Also I just started listening to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span>'s podcast and it's been eerie (and fulfilling) to hear so similar thoughts.<br/>My thinking for the last few years has been around more incremental improvements to the programming status quo. ~2 years ago I built a JSON editor that doesn't let you syntax error (<a href="https://gregoor.github.io/syntactor">https://gregoor.github.io/syntactor</a>). It was supposed to be a full JS editor, but I drowned in TODOS. I talked about the project at the Salon des Refuses of that year (and met <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Philip Tchernavskij</span>, nice to see you here :slightly_smiling_face: ).<br/>I've restarted the project a couple of months ago and I'm close to having it in a state worth showing. It's not super out there (you're still "just writing" JavaScript) but I think it's a step out of the text-manipulation stone age we currently live in.<br/>In my day job I work as the lead developer on Mozilla's Common Voice (<a href="https://voice.mozilla.org/en">https://voice.mozilla.org/en</a>). Leave your voice if you want to contribute to an open data set :upside_down_face: I live in Berlin, so if you're around ping me, and I'll show you some great vietnamese restaurant. :ramen:

Hi folks. I’m Will Crichton, a CS PhD student at Stanford. I work on large-scale programmable systems (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner">https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner</a>) and I also teach the programming languages course here (<a href="http://cs242.stanford.edu/f18/">http://cs242.stanford.edu/f18/</a>). Deeply interested in the psychology of programming and understanding cognitive models of computation. Also, of course got a blog: <a href="http://willcrichton.net/notes/">http://willcrichton.net/notes/</a>

Hi! I see everyone prefers to use their real names here, but I prefer the oldschool approach of staying at least slightly anonymous online. Hope that's fine.<br/>I'm a software architect from Europe, I work on medical systems and SaaS platforms.<br/>Outside that I actively work on problems related to programming languages, language development, code comprehensibility and internalization. I joined this Slack after randomly stumbling upon the FoC podcast, which was very exciting for me right off the bat. Hope to have some discussions with people about new and fresh ideas, and on how to improve/iterate on <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span>’s concepts, especially with regards to the "quickly alter the software you're using" idea.

Hi, I'm a "creative technologist" running a small studio (<a href="http://flow-control.io">flow-control.io</a>) and hacking on different projects (<a href="http://szymonkaliski.com">szymonkaliski.com</a>), I work mostly in this alley of weird projects, ranging from data visualization and complex UI to art installations, generative graphics, etc. I also make experimental music with DIY software and hardware; I'm very interested in how tools shape what we do, and been recently experimenting with making some domain-specific tools for myself and others; besides all of this I also teach at SWPS university (intro to processing and arduino), and I'm part-time researcher at ink&amp;switch where I work on end-user-programming research.

I'm in the typed functional programming camp. I've been working with Scala since the beginning in 2004. I'm a member of the Scala SIP (ie. language design) committee and a contributor to both Scala 2 and the upcoming Scala 3 (aka Dotty) compiler ... currently my day job is 50% work on the latter. I'm also the author of shapeless, Scala's main generic programming library, and a cofounder of Typelevel, an umbrella group for Scala projects which focuses on the typed functional end of the Scala spectrum combined with a desire to create a welcoming environment for people coming from outside that tradition.<br/>Types are very much my thing, and I take the view that dependent types in particular are the future. I think of Scala and Haskell as being the partially dependent status quo, and languages like Agda and Idris showing the way ahead.

Hello, I’m a long time Clojure developer based in Athens, Greece. I used to live in London for almost two decades. My personal journey was BASIC -&gt; some C/C++ -&gt; Perl -&gt; Java -&gt; Clojure. I’m currently the tech lead for a couple of small Clojure teams (3 devs in each team but with very different projects) and I’m very interested in developer experience (DX as opposed to UX) so I found that the podcast really resonated with me. I’m here to just hang out and discuss stimulating ideas!

Hello! I am a frontend developer from Kharkiv (Ukraine). I contribute to open source projects and work on my own framework called Rete.js. <a href="http://rete.js.org">http://rete.js.org</a><br/><br/>I started learning programming more than 5 years ago, studied languages ​​ PHP -&gt; JS -&gt; C++ -&gt; C# -&gt; Java -&gt; ES6/TS. Now basically I programming on JavaScript.<br/><br/>At the moment I see the benefit for myself in languages ​​such as JS/TS and C++, but one of the problems still remains - writing the code. Perhaps someone will argue that you need to have a good knowledge  of programming language. I agree, good knowledge will allow you to write quality code, but there are problems with reading someone else's code that is written in a different style (or has poor quality).<br/><br/>Being inspired by UE4, Substance Designer and Plant factory I decided to write my own library for creating such editors in the browser (dataflow programming). At that time (as now) I didn’t find a universal and customizable framework/library. I have started writing a library called D3-Node-Editor (March, 2017) and after a year of development I revised many approaches and rewrote it to the new architecture and called Rete.js. <a href="https://github.com/retejs/rete">https://github.com/retejs/rete</a><br/><br/>Are there somebody who have experience in Dataflow programming and know the current unsolved problems? I'm going to postgraduate studies to working with dataflow and my framework, but my scientific director (I hope I correctly translated to english phrase "научный руководитель") says that a dissertation must contains scientific novelty, and framework is only a tool. So I am not sure whether to continue studying at the university in order to do this, since among professors no one has much experience with visual programming.

Hey folks, I'm Jasim and for a long time I thought that programming was just expressions, mutation, loops, and i/o - and you had it all. "Give me a Turing machine and I shall move mountains" or something like that.<br/><br/>But one day I had enough - a Javascript framework I used at work was not performant, yet I couldn't dig down because its abstractions were opaque and non-programmable. And it was making it difficult to do my job, causing real stress. But I couldn't put my hands on what was actually wrong. Was it my lack of understanding, or had it to do with the tool itself? To get to its root I had to understand programming at a meta-level and that rabbit hole took me into CTM by Peter Van Roy, who describes it thus:<br/><br/>&gt; We define programming, as a general human activity, to mean the act of extending or changing a system's functionality. Programming is a widespread activity that is done both by nonspecialists (eg: consumers who change the settings of their alarm clock or cellular phone) and specialists (computer programmers, the audience for this book).<br/><br/>I see the <em>future of programming</em> as this infinite game were things that previously needed specialists keep moving into non-specialist territory, yet the field keeps growing and constantly keeps giving birth to new specialisations.<br/><br/>And I'm working on a product at a distant proximity to this: a tool for UI designers that makes their designs live by providing clean &amp; precise HTML and CSS as they design. It is called Protoship Codegen and is at <a href="https://protoship.io">https://protoship.io</a>.<br/><br/>I tweet at <a href="http://twitter.com/jasim_ab">twitter.com/jasim_ab</a>, where I mostly advocate for the mainstreaming of Typed Functional Programming, am a regular listener of the podcast, and am excited to meet you all!

Hi all, I'm Noah.  Gosh, there's a lot of interesting work represented here.  I'm an untrained, uneducated freelance web dev in Tennessee who, about 3 years ago, thought: "wouldn't be cool if you could actually see programs?"  Since then I've discovered Fred Brooks, Bret Victor, VISSOFT, and, well, Computer Science in general.  And recently, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> and the community he has begun to catalogue and connect!  Hats off to you.  My initial goal has refined, but is largely unchanged: create massive visualizations of software behaviour for experienced workaday programmers.  My current stab looks like this:<br/><br/>Target language: JavaScript (preferable ES6)<br/>Analysis method: instrumentation and dynamic analysis<br/>Drawing: WebGL<br/>Target elements of software behaviour: data flow within control flow

Hi all,<br/>- I came across the future of coding podcast a few weeks ago, and got through just about all of the back catalogue by listening whenever I was driving<br/><br/>- I'm from the UK, currently near Bristol.<br/><br/>- My undergrad was in Ergonomics/Human Factors Design<br/>	- My dissertation was on improving the graphical communication of a commonly used (in the field) cognitive tool/methodology (hierarchical task analysis)<br/><br/>- I've done a lot more programming in C than Javascript/functional languages, so I may be coming from a slightly different place than many here, but hey, it takes all sorts right?! :wink:<br/>	- I'm also a 'fan' of the Handmade Hero/Handmade Network approach to programming. I'm hoping that these aren't incompatible!<br/>	- I do want the programmer/software design experience to be better, but I want to make sure this is not at the expense of the end user of the software.<br/>		- The key components of the argument are roughly<br/>			- We can't expect improved hardware to account for reduced software performance:<br/>				1) Individual processors seem to have reached a heat barrier in terms of clock speed<br/>				2) Most problems are not trivially parallelizable across multiple processors.<br/>			- Generalized abstractions tend to have a significant performance cost attached<br/>		- As such, there is (at least for the moment) a class of problems where the cost of writing in beautiful abstractions is too high in terms of end program performance.<br/>		- For this area, I think that the biggest wins are likely to be in improving the UI/UX/representation and reducing the feedback loop<br/>	- I've previously made rudimentary C tools aimed at reducing the feedback loop - live recompiling, live variable editing.<br/><br/>- I'm currently working on something similar to Glen Chiacchieri's REPLugger using LLVM/Clang. This is starting with C(++), but should hopefully not be too difficult to add frontends for other compiled languages due to the way LLVM works.

Hi all! I’m a Computational Media PhD student at the Expressive Intelligence Studio at UC Santa Cruz, working on approachable and playful mixed-initiative (AI+human creative collaboration) tools to augment human creativity. Like a lot of you, Bret Victor’s work was probably the main thing that got me into future-of-programming stuff, but I’m also inspired by games like Spore that place the process of creating stuff at the center of the play experience. More recently I’ve been thinking a lot about the problem of how to empower people to shape their digital social environments to suit their personal and community-specific needs.<br/><br/>I’m nominally an “AI researcher”, but I think the approaches to AI that are currently in vogue make a critical mistake: they focus way too much on <em>guessing</em> what people want rather than <em>asking</em> them what they want (and giving them the languages they need to answer properly). As a result, all of the AI problems I’m interested in end up also being HCI and/or PL problems to some extent, and my work keeps overlapping with future-of-programming stuff in interesting ways.<br/><br/>Some of you probably recognize me from Twitter; I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkreminski">https://twitter.com/maxkreminski</a>. My personal website and blog is at <a href="https://mkremins.github.io">https://mkremins.github.io</a>.

I'm a Javascript React frontend dev. Right now I'm trying out ideas on the side in a few areas:<br/>• Coloring interfaces. I'm actively working on an experiment for this. This work might be helpful for future app UI design tools. I'll post links on this soon.<br/>• Responsive components. I want to set breakpoints at the component level, not at the page level.<br/>• Random experiments in hierarchical and composable systems.<br/><br/>The hypothesis is that better primitives can unlock a lot of new possibilities, specifically for programming UIs.<br/><br/>Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> for tweeting a link to this. It's very exciting that there's a community of people who are interested in the future of coding.

I'm Martijn Brekelmans, although I prefer to go by Laura because of ... reasons!<br/>I'm an employed software engineer, got my diploma as a computer engineering student, which is: 1 year EE, 3 years CS, trained to program chips, learn C, C++, Linux systems programming, driver development, FPGA's, etcetcetc...<br/>Buuttt I work as a full-stack web-developer for now, PHP, JavaScript and MySQL, the original stack :stuck_out_tongue:<br/>I'm always exploring something or building something new, because I like exploration and finding out what is possible.<br/><br/>As for most people here, I also have an unhealthy obsession with Bret Victor's work.<br/><br/>Most of my work revolves around data visualisation, playing with language &amp; words, interactive toys &amp; generative art and various experiments with user interfaces, programming languages and code-editor software/insights. Although I don't usually share much of what I do, I think this place is perfect for feedback and discussions!

Hi! I am Clemens Klokmose. I'm interested in how to make programming in some form or the other part of everyday computing, and in how to break out of the traditional application silos. I'm a computer scientist by training and working as a professor at department of digital design and information studies at Aarhus University, where I teach students with a humanities background programming. I'm also in charge of the Webstrates project (<a href="http://webstrates.net">webstrates.net</a>).

&gt; FP is hostile towards ease of learning and use because it is a bastion of the priesthood, which seeks to obscure and obfuscate the processes of programming. They love crazy terms like monad and functors, Words which are not even in graduate level mathematics. Backus would be mad<br/><br/>:smile: like it!

I am the default leader of the next-gen language developer's association, and try to coordinate and communicate with the key members of the development teams who are working on the next generation language, which includes Parasail, Red, Luna, Beads, Elm, Chapel, etc.  It is a very competitive situation, but since inertia is the most powerful force in the universe, we new language enthusiasts need to stick together enough to get the masses to realize that there is a major problem out there, and that JavaScript (a blatant but uncredited copy of Macromedia's ActionScript 2) is not the end-state.

My first love language as an undergrad was Smalltalk. My weapon of choice today is Clojure. I generally like the stuff that I'm sure most people like : Lisps, Smalltalk, Parc, HARC.<br/><br/>My current thinking on new languages / areas of investigation / demands in my manifesto are these :<br/><br/>1) expressing computation is a solved problem. We have Lambda calculus, Lisp-like functions, Smalltalk-like messages. These are fine. We don't need to worry about these.<br/><br/>The areas we need to explore further are in expressing complex data-structures, "architecture" and constraints. My recent thinking on OO is that what makes OO "hard" is that we don't have good ways of expressing larger scale assemblages of objects. And there's too much focus on the individual class, rather than the collective of how classes or objects act together.<br/><br/>2) A second problem is that programming languages make us do the work in an order that suits them. Our job as programmers is to give a number of constraints to the computer that define a program. The problem is that the computer makes us give the constraints in the order and format that is convenient for it. Often requiring us to fit into architectural restrictions that we don't, in fact, care about but which are part of the fussy housekeeping of the system ... eg. why am I jumping between different files to fill in information about model, about view, about database, about client UI? Etc? Why can't I express what's important to me, in one place, in the order that suits me, and have the computer go back and wire these together?<br/><br/>The first of these thoughts is making me interested in grammars. And the way that ML or Haskell define complex data-schema with algebraic data-types in an almost Backus-Naur style. Can we use something like this to declare assemblages of objects?

Hi everyone,<br/><br/>I'm Phil and I suffer from the same the disease that many of you do. I know, just know, that there could be a much better, much easier, much more powerful way to write software than the way we're doing it at the moment.

Hi, I'm Jack Armitage. I am a PhD student in Media &amp; Arts Technologies in the Augmented Instruments Lab, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London.<br/><br/>I have been studying music technology and musical instrument design for around 10 years. My undergrad was BSc Music, Multimedia &amp; Electronics at the University of Leeds, and after that I was a research engineer at <a href="http://www.roli.com">www.roli.com</a> and later <a href="http://www.fxpansion.com">www.fxpansion.com</a> working on instrument quality and developing visuo-tactile materials and interfaces. My PhD focuses on craft in digital musical instrument design, and how one's "ability to craft" is impacted by the tools, methods and technologies used (<a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=APvoBhUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=APvoBhUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en</a>).<br/><br/>I was somehow exposed to Bret Victor's Inventing on Principle around 2012 at the end of my undergrad, and from there I became quite obsessed with the history of 'The New Medium'. While working in the music technology industry I was seeing everything through Bret Victor and Alan Kay's eyes; 10's of expert designers and engineers spending 10's of thousands of pounds and 6 months to explore singular, basic ideas, and as a result not having any time or money - or even awareness - of possible 'bigger ideas' that could be explored.<br/><br/>I started my PhD wanting to solve these problems by creating new tools and programming languages that treat instrument designers as artists (see 'Artists and the Art of the Luthier' by Bill Buxton). However I made the mistake of interviewing violin makers in my first study, which has taken me down the rabbit hole of embodied craft practice, which I am now trying to reconcile with digital technology :slightly_smiling_face:. In my spare time I compose and produce music, and 'live code' music onstage using Haskell (<a href="http://tidalcycles.org">http://tidalcycles.org</a>). My latest music project just launched on Tuesday: <a href="http://offer.band">http://offer.band</a><br/><br/>Based in London, always happy to talk over email or meet up for a coffee, and host visits to the Instruments Lab (<a href="http://instrumentslab.org">http://instrumentslab.org</a>). Thank you <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> for inviting me to the recent London meetup and subsequently to this group. I am very intrigued to learn more about the people in this group!

Hi - I am Antranig Basman. I'm part of an overlapping group of publicly funded projects to improve people's access to technology. These are funded under the general headline of "accessibility" and improving the lives of people with disabilities, but we quickly realised that this mission will be uneconomic and unpractical unless we reform the way technology is built, and most importantly eliminate the use of all currently popular programming languages.<br/><br/>What we seek is to "democratise the affordances of computation" so that they can be accessed with as few barriers as possible imposed by interaction modality, style of cognition, representation, etc. We say "the affordances of computation" rather than "computation" since we believe what the public needs is not well described by computation as classically conceived.<br/><br/>If you're interested in a semi-technical exposition of what this means in terms of a conception of "Open Authorship", you can read my Onward 2018 preprint at <a href="https://github.com/amb26/papers/blob/master/onward-2016/onward-2016.pdf">https://github.com/amb26/papers/blob/master/onward-2016/onward-2016.pdf</a> - I live in London, looking forward to chatting with you all about many topics of interest! I'm particularly interested these days in reading about the philosophy and history of the numerous scientific and mathematical concepts that we tend to take for granted, and am a great fan of Lakatos, Lakoff, and Lakos.

Hi! I'm Michael Arntzenius, I go by "rntz" online. I used to think I would reinvent programming all by my lonesome. Then I realized it might be a tad more difficult than I thought, so I scaled back. Nowadays I'm mostly chugging away in academia at little problems that I can make headway on, like: how do we combine functional and relational/set-oriented programming nicely? (For that, see <a href="http://www.rntz.net/datafun/">http://www.rntz.net/datafun/</a>) But I'm still interested in the bigger picture. Themes I keep coming back to are:<br/><br/>1. Small programs. Ideas last longer than code. So make your code small enough it becomes an idea.<br/><br/>2. Monotonicity: systems that always go in "one direction", eg. append-only databases, CRDTs, LVars, propagators, recursion in Datalog...<br/><br/>3. Incrementality. I think a lot of code is incidentally complex because it's trying to handle <em>change</em> efficiently. How can we make this easy?<br/><br/>4. Unexpected uses of simple type systems. Eg. To enforce monotonicity; or, as dynamic contracts rather than static guarantees; or, as data for metaprogramming with.<br/><br/>5. Communication. Maybe the future is in lots of special-purpose tools/langs, not one tool to rule them all. But for that to work, we need tools that work together well. Unix byte-streams were a useful first step in this direction, but are too limiting.<br/><br/>I joined this Slack after seeing on Twitter that there had been a meetup in London. I live in Oxford, so maybe I can come down the next time a meetup happens.<br/><br/>Also, hello <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Thomas Ballinger</span>!

Hey y'all! Been listening to Steve's podcast for a while now and managed to meet up with him for a bit while he was in Boston. I work at a data pipeline startup, and help run both Boston's Elm Meetup and a weekly functional programming meetup with a few friends.<br/><br/>I also have a future-of-coding-esqe personal project that I've been mapping out for a while, and want to get more serious about implementing. The use case is rapidly developing and combining little personal systems for note-taking, note-organizing, goal tracking, task prioritization, etc. The system itself will be a combination visual + textual editor for a big strongly typed frp-ish program, plus a live-updating view that's a user-defined pure function of the state of the frp network. I'm trying to make it so that "if it compiles, it's deployed". I am in way over my head with this and will need all the help I can get!

Hello everyone.  I am middle age woman who had many directions in life from studying math to becoming a visual artist, stage director and actress. Recently I am self educating myself on programming and facing the problem that I feel a lot of people will be facing since getting into “knowing” what to do with a computer and in the computer is unavoidable. There is a need of thinking in more abstract terms that would allow learning through common logic of human mind rather than education done in unfamiliar to non-computer oriented mind language that describes another unknown language that talks to unknown and sometime “scary” beast - computer. Languages I have learn so far are Javascript, Elixir, Python, (html,css ), some Golang. While I am introducing myself to languages I am growing in understanding on difficulties and trying to bring into my mind solutions how things could be explained in more “human terms” and logic. I hope participating in this group will introduce new paths for people to cross the gap from not knowing into knowing what to do and how to approach computer programming.

Hello everyone, I am the founder of Postman (<a href="http://www.getpostman.com">www.getpostman.com</a>). I built Postman as a side-project and thanks to the support of the dev community has grown to become a powerful tool used by more than 5 million people. I am super passionate about development easier, faster, and more accessible to everyone. I came across <a href="http://futureofcoding.org">futureofcoding.org</a> recently and thought it’d be great to join the community and learn more from everyone. We have several challenges in meeting the needs of devs (new and expert) and I am always curious about new ideas!

I'm excited about programming education (I volunteer with Software Carpentry and worked at the Recurse Center for 4 years) and have reached the point where I've been excited about possible programming futures for long enough to start being a little questioning, but I'm not cynical yet :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>Oh I'm interesting and occasionally involved in the IPython/Jupyter world, and I still like REPLs and wrote a new terminal frontend for bpython - I liked the rewind feature and made some changes to it that makes it more exciting for live-coding.

:wave: Hello! Daytime I work as a web developer (Rails, react, etc) and nights/weekends/mornings I’m finishing up a dissertation on the early history of software engineering. I’m interested in the past and future of programming. I found this slack through the podcast, which I think i probably saw on twitter…

Aloha, everyone! A few years ago, I co-founded a company with the specific mission of reinventing the development experience. On the practical side, this means that we build a new kind of an IDE called the Glamorous Toolkit. However, our main focus is on the human behavior, and as we build our environment, we create several new techniques. We call the overall approach moldable development based on the idea that the environment must adapt to the context of our system. I can say that I now program fundamentally different than I did 5 years ago.<br/><br/>Glamorous Toolkit is implemented in Pharo and it comes with a complete graphical stack that has some interesting properties. For example, it includes a live documentation and notebook technology right in the IDE. We reached a first alpha version a couple of months ago. I'd love to talk about it and other people's experience. Some details can be found here: <a href="https://feenk.com/gt">https://feenk.com/gt</a>

I'm generally interested in ideas to make programmers more efficient. I'm working on a platform that allows programmers to more easily make and distribute their own custom tools with the goal of facilitating more innovation in our field. There are some animated GIFs here <a href="https://github.com/robenkleene/webconsole">https://github.com/robenkleene/webconsole</a> and a simple product page for something related I'm planning on shipping here <a href="https://thepotionlab.com">https://thepotionlab.com</a> I'm based on New York and would love to chat with anyone interested in any of these topics!

Hello everyone. :wave:<br/><br/>I want to reinvent programming, or help anyone else who is, because I fear that we are squandering human achievement otherwise. Computers are the pinnacle of human invention, a universal machine, and we have locked their use behind a techno priesthood who speak arcane runes. Instead of computers becoming the bicycle of the mind we have created TV 2.0. It seems ridiculous and hugely inefficient to me that the people with domain specific knowledge need to hire others to encode that knowledge into a computer program. We should create tools to enable the domain expert.<br/><br/>I’m currently working on a bimodal visualization of React Components. Bimodal because both the visual and the textual views are first class meaning changes are propagated to the other. I’m very interested in bimodal types of programming as I feel that while text is great at expressing detail, it isn’t as effective as visuals in communicating structure and relationships. I’m limiting this tool to React Components because I’m unsure if this tool will actually be very effective and I want a well defined and small space to play in.<br/><br/>If anyone wants to grab a beer/coffee/tea in Pittsburgh, PA and talk programming just DM me.

Hi everybody! I’m a programmer based in Dubai/Kashmir. I’m a Mechanical engineer by training, but have been programming since a very young age. I tried to build multiple edtech products before this, and all of them failed and taught me important lessons and I’m happy to be a better developer and even better person because of those experiences. I love reading the works of Vannevar Bush, Alan Kay and Bret Victor. I also like hiking and camping, and also Urdu/Persian/Kashmiri poetry.<br/><br/>I’m currently working on a project which doesn’t have a name yet. But I’m basically trying to build a new type of digital document which is intended to be non-linear, dynamic, and action-oriented.<br/><br/>The document can be made using an editor that I’m currently building which will resemble Google Docs in terms of UI, but the document itself will allow writers to write in a format that allows you to “dive deeper” into particular sections of text allowing readers to go down a “rabbit hole” or skim a document.<br/><br/>The document will also be connected to various webservices and will allow users to construct pipelines of actions/triggers which can modify it, for example — “When somebody mentions me on Twitter, add a row to this table on this document, send an SMS to my friend, and then set the value of the “mentions” column on this other table to +1 from what it is already” .<br/><br/>I don’t have a name for the project right now, but I’m close to launching a public version of it. I wish to speak with people who can critique the idea, offer some feedback, or even if it sounds useful/useless I am happy to hear more about why/why not.<br/><br/>I am also applying to business school these days and sorting out my GMAT, although if I could afford it, I would just focus on building this full time.

Hey everyone! I just finished catching up on Steve’s podcast, which is how I found this group. I discovered the podcast while researching folks who were teaching Elm as a first programming language. The first episode to which I listened was Professor Anand’s interview, and it remains one of my favorites. In the last couple years, I’ve become very involved in the Elm community, and I’m excited about its potential as a tool to teach programming.<br/><br/>I’m a based in Chicago. Currently, I’m not working on anything worth promoting. I just wrapped up some experiments with a BEAM backend for the Elm compiler, which may be interesting to some folks here: <a href="https://kofi.sexy/blog/elm-beam">https://kofi.sexy/blog/elm-beam</a>. At this point, I’m primarily here to learn more about the work happening in this area. I’m also open to opportunities to transition my own career in that direction. Looking forward to great conversations!

Hey, I'm a software developer based in Bucharest. I'm not working on anything I could call the future of programming yet. Although, this project shows my interest with increasing developer efficiency. It's a command line interface for documentation: <a href="http://cli.elbear.com/">http://cli.elbear.com/</a><br/><br/>Other than that, I'm interested in exploring how tooling for functional languages could be improved. Specifically, I think Haskell could have hugely better tooling thanks to its immutability and pure functions.

Hiya, I live in London and currently work on a consumer app that's unrelated to all this.<br/><br/>However, lately I've been gripped by the idea that the way we build our computing systems today can't possibly be sustainable. Assuming we're still computing in 1000 years, I'm convinced it won't look like this—so how do we start moving in that direction?<br/><br/>At the beginning of my career almost 20 years ago I worked on a system at MAYA Design (Civium/Visage/VIA Repository) that used unconventional approaches like storing data in key-value dictionaries with UUIDs that could be easily distributed/synced across the network, as well as a message-based/boxes-and-wires programming model where the code modules were also stored in these dictionaries, so that computing could happen wherever was convenient. (It mostly worked, but was a bit slow.)<br/><br/>I'm interested in seeing what systems have been built since then that explore similar ideas, since I feel that data storage &amp; management is a useful lens to help us see the future of computing. I've already spent a few days following links from this Slack, and the closest things I found so far were the Houyhnhnm Computing essays, <a href="http://Sandstorm.io">Sandstorm.io</a>, IPFS, Urbit, and Camlistore. (I'd appreciate pointers to other things in that vein.)<br/><br/>I'm also very interested in the meta-problem of how to architect new technologies in a way that aligns people's and companies' incentives to increase their chances of getting developed and adopted.<br/><br/>Thanks to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> for building this beacon to help us find each other, and to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> for getting me on board. Looking forward to meeting some of you at a future London meetup!

Hey! I'm Dev. I used to work with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Aidan Cunniffe</span> at Dropsource (and he invited me here). I've been interested in software synthesis/code generation and event sourcing architecture for a long time. I'm currently focused more on the event sourcing side but have been enjoying the Future of Programming podcast and am looking forward to seeing what you all are up to!

Hi all, I'm Jeremy, currently based in London where I am working for a Fintech. I have spent a lot of time recently thinking about topics related to this field and I plan to spend a growing amount of my time exploring the question of whether these ideas can be brought to life. Just like everyone else, I do not know what exactly this might turn into. My academic background is in maths and I have always had an interest in computers, and particularly the visual usage of these.<br/><br/>An example of what frustrated (frustrates) me growing up was walking around a video game world complete with environment, characters etc. and not having any control to modify or create any of the game myself, without going back to 'square 1' so to speak. I look forward to following the conversations as they develop here.<br/><br/>P.S. I found this community through Steve's post on 'A Visual History of Eve' (<a href="https://futureofcoding.org/essays/eve/">https://futureofcoding.org/essays/eve/</a>).

I learned about this group from the Future of Programming unsession at strangeloop. I'm interested in ways that make computing more accessible for everyone. I'm working on a DSL for reactive pixel art called Pikov <a href="https://github.com/google/pikov">https://github.com/google/pikov</a> Currently the reactive behavior is just Markov chains, but I'm interested in ways to incorporate transitions based on events in a natural visual programming interface.

Hi folks!  I've been a developer for a couple decades and have been doing research mathematics in finite group theory and art hacks on the side for some time.  I'm currently shifting my career away from commercial software development and pursuing my own research harder.  At the moment obsessed with program synthesis...which is how I found this forum.

Hi all. I was recently introduced to Steve. I see I've stumbled across some like-minded folks here (i.e. "programming can be so much better!!!"). Like many of you, I'm a gentleman scientist (<a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/independent-research">https://nadiaeghbal.com/independent-research</a>), tinkering with language ideas that I'd love to use with real work -- like Automatic Concurrency, Automatic Mutable State Safety, Safe Hot Swap, Automatic Garbage Collection, and Friendly Dependent Types. I'm based in Denver in case anyone else is here. I find myself in Boston, SF (recently for YC events), and NYC now and then too, and love to talk PLs. Nice to be here.

Hi! My name is Rae and I just graduated from Columbia University with a CS degree. I think I landed here based on a podcast and came down a rabbit hole finding myself agreeing with this thought “why haven’t we thought about the future of programming more?” I’m currently doing a lot of software engineering interviews atm and a project on tagging patient stories and medical terms (think webMD but like chatbot style almost) - a NLP model is already well trained for this, I’m just building an interface on top of it.

Hi everyone! Lately I tend to introduce myself as a barbarian programmer. I mean that in a few different ways:<br/><br/>• I tend to be a curmudgeon, happier by myself than "organizing" into groups to achieve some shared goal. This doesn't mean I dislike collaboration. I just think we tend to conflate collaboration with <em>synchronous</em> collaboration, and asynchronous collaboration is a better fit for many tasks. Asynchronous collaboration can span great distances in space and time. You reading Aristotle could be asynchronous collaboration -- if you are then able to build on what you read in some way and put out some artifact that someone else can collaborate with. UX people like to say "don't make me think". I like to say "don't make me talk to you". Show me what you built in a form that I can read, listen to, play interactively with and gradually understand/appreciate. I may still come talk to you if the situation merits it (I actually love talking to people, believe it or not), but give me the choice.<br/>• I think we've been doing city-living cheek-by-jowl for so long that we've forgotten what benefits it has, and continue cargo-culting it long after it's become superfluous. I don't mean that literally; I love living in cities. But our software stacks have many of the same patterns as cities, and they aren't really necessary: a) promiscuously adding dependencies, b) relying implicitly on some sort of division of labor, so that if we find a problem in a dependency we don't feel empowered to fix it for ourselves, instead turning to ways to try to get others to do it for us like paying, bullying, cajoling, passing laws, etc. It's worth swinging that pendulum back a bit, to imagine we're out on the steppe with just what we have on our backs and nobody else around for miles, and try to achieve our ends with 10x fewer libraries and frameworks. (More details: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16882140#16882555">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16882140#16882555</a> .)<br/>• It emphasizes sustainability. When you live off the land (I gather; I wouldn't actually know) you are more attuned to how you affect your environment. Your <em>externalities</em>. We city dwellers just expect someone else to cart our trash out for us.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this is all aspirational, because the way we write software doesn't really work for a barbarian. I've been working very slowly on extricating a kernel of software and way of writing software that can be more self-sufficient and sustainable. I started out building a new programming language based on Lisp (<a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart">http://akkartik.name/post/wart</a>, which itself grew out of a startup; those who can't startup shave yaks), then grew frustrated with the stack below me and simultaneously realized languages don't matter, and build a toy VM and OS (<a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu#readme">https://github.com/akkartik/mu#readme</a> ; <a href="http://akkartik.name/about">http://akkartik.name/about</a>), used it to teach programming for a couple of years, then grew frustrated with how slow it was and gradually faced up to the need to understand even more low-level details. Lately I've been building simple tools for programming in machine code (<a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu/tree/master/subx#readme">https://github.com/akkartik/mu/tree/master/subx#readme</a>), but in the past week I've set this aside to design a type-safe language that I can bootstrap out of machine code (no link yet).

Hello everyone! Many thanks to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> for inviting me to this place. My name is Joel and I live in Cambridge, UK, where I completed my CS undergraduate degree last summer. For the past year I've been a software engineer in a local startup. But it is my working on my blog (<a href="https://programmingmadecomplicated.wordpress.com">https://programmingmadecomplicated.wordpress.com</a>) and on the general vision that we share here, that gives me true fulfillment - especially since nobody I've met in real life expresses any sort of interest or enthusiasm about this sort of thing. Fortunately I've found many who do online, and I'll eagerly attend any meetups in the UK.<br/><br/>Origin story is, in a nutshell: I wanted to make games as a kid so I learned GameMaker. I then traded the ability to make games for learning to Code Properly and now I want my creativity-outlet back :angry:<br/><br/>I would try different programming languages and libraries, different paradigms, design patterns, and all sorts of elaborate schemes to manage the complexity of code in my various barely-started game projects. I enlisted as a main developer for an online fan game project, and couldn't deliver the goods. I eventually developed some sort of philosophical paralysis about programming in general, questioning my life choices and wondering if I could ever tolerate the career path I was headed towards, until I was snapped out of it from finding Alan Kay, Bret Victor and VPRI on the 'net roughly two years ago. Finally I realised that one of my basic foundations, that of "language being primary / fundamental", was in reality a limiting box of artificial creation :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>And now I really, really want to explore bootstrapping and try to bootstrap a graphical system somehow using shapes instead of source code.<br/><br/>(meanwhile, at work I just do normal frustrating software-engineer stuff :neutral_face: but I will not stay there forever.)

Hi! I'm Spencer. I live in NYC.<br/><br/>I have had crazy ideas about programming languages bouncing around in my head for at least a year now. It seems to me that inadequacies in our programming languages and surrounding tooling are the root cause of most technological troubles.<br/><br/>I've previously worked with computer vision, where I implemented a number of image processing algorithms. The tools we used were grossly insufficient for the task. CUDA was painfully low level, all algorithms became mucked up with performance concerns, code was not portable, build systems were tangled nightmares of dependencies on antiquated software from the 70's... I've been trying to find a better way.<br/><br/>My ideas are still vague and poorly defined but a month ago I started taking these thoughts seriously. I've been learning type theory in an attempt to gain the necessary background to either implement my ideas or determine if they are even feasible. I have a very long way to go to acquire enough background to even understand what I'm getting into... but you have to start somewhere!

hi! I'm Mariano Guerra, Software Engineer (actually Information Systems Engineer but close) from Argentina, currently living in Stuttgart, I like Distributed Systems, Swarm Intelligence/Emergent Systems and more specific to this group, creating programming languages, I created "standard" ones like efene[1] and more visual ones, two of them products that I developed and are my current source of income, the old one Event Fabric[2]: a data flow/scratch mix that ended up being more complex for customers to understand than what I expected. From the lessons learned from that one I developed a new one from scratch (no pun intended) called instadeq[3], which later I found out is part of a family of programming languages known as programming by demonstration (knowing about them before starting would have made it faster to develop it :slightly_smiling_face:).  Last October we migrated our customers from event fabric to instadeq and now we are focusing on launching the SaaS version of it.<br/><br/>[1]  <a href="http://efene.org/">http://efene.org/</a><br/>[2] <a href="https://www.event-fabric.com/">https://www.event-fabric.com/</a><br/>[3] <a href="https://instadeq.com/">https://instadeq.com/</a>

Hello everyone! <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nikolas Martens</span> mentioned this slack in his log, so now I'm here. So glad that I found a place with people that share my passion.<br/>Hey <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span>, glad that you're also here.<br/><br/>My name is Vladimir and I live in Russia, currently in Saint Petersburg.<br/>I always loved programming languages and was curious about alternative ways to program.<br/><br/>Some years ago I became fascinated by Bret Victor's ideas, especially his "Future Programming" and "Seeing Spaces" talks.<br/>This realization that is not technology's fault that we don't have better tools, but just lack of culture, improper attitude -- it felt really striking.<br/>So I wanted to contribute to development of this new culture somehow. Introduce this thinking into daily life.<br/><br/>As a full-time employee I had to work on my projects on weekends.<br/>I would love to do it full time. In order to get that I need to turn project into something commercial.<br/>Something that makes people ready to pay to stop the pain of alternative.<br/><br/>So I tried to create a "Seeing tool" for debugging (not Seeing Space though). A tool that captures trace events for Erlang/OTP platform and visualizes them.<br/>Makes it easier to understand what's happening. Allows to skip the pain of reading hundreds of lines of text logs. It may save hundreds of working hours.<br/>I choosed Erlang/OTP first because underlying model of isolated processes and message passing is really easy to visualize and manipulate with.<br/>Second because it provides powerful tracing API, that makes it very easy to start. And third: I already had experience working in production with Erlang and I loved it.<br/><br/>I took a couple of months break and worked on Batiscaph project: <a href="https://github.com/vladimir-vg/batiscaph">https://github.com/vladimir-vg/batiscaph</a><br/>Here is the demo video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNr7o9eg4Ck">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNr7o9eg4Ck</a><br/><br/>I got a working prototype, yet it's far from being useful in production.<br/>I realized that road to commercializing this project is really long, may take years.<br/>I stopped this project for now and thinking about shorter ways of bringing new thinking into daily life.<br/><br/>Currently I'm thinking about new medium for software and hypermedia (That's why I was reading <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nikolas Martens</span> zells logs: <a href="https://github.com/zells/project/tree/master/log">https://github.com/zells/project/tree/master/log</a>).<br/>Got one exciting idea about it. Also it might be easily connected to something not programming related, something that people use in daily life, thus bigger market and maybe easier commercialization.

As prompted by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> I’ll do a little introduction. I’m a PhD student at the University of Melbourne (Australia), working on tangible mixed reality interfaces for design work. I’ve been interested in alternative visions of programming for a few years now, following Bret Victor and Eve etc., but don’t have any projects of my own. My PhD research isn’t about programming but it somewhat overlaps with the kind of interfaces championed by Bret and Dynamicland. It’s still early days here though.

Hey all. Introductions? Ok, well, I made video games for 25+ years C64-&gt;PS3, worked on the Chrome GPU team at Google making WebGL, and stumbled on the Future of Coding podcast recently.<br/><br/>I don't know if have anything to add but I am interested in the topic. I wrote a simple signal based visual programming system for a game I worked on. I worked with a visual programming system called "Virtools" in like 2004. I also got lucky and by chance got to visit Dynamicland last March. I would love to discuss all that stuff somewhere and learn more.

Hey <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Gregg Tavares</span>, I’ve just read your “Life Goals 2018” blog post. Two paragraphs in, I was hooked. I worked at Apple seven years, quit two years ago, and I can relate to everything you write. I’m also in a finding phase, living off my Apple savings, still with enough runway so I’m exactly in that position where it’s comfortable enough to explore whatever, and not uncomfortable enough to get your ass kicked into action. On good days I’m trying to push some projects forward that I consider meaningful, on other days I’m in that “the planet’s going to shit” mood (climate change, politics, etc.) that’s not helping with anything.<br/><br/>Then you write about cancer. Over the last few months, I’ve been spending many hours talking with a good friend once a week during his chemotherapy. We used to work at Apple together, so we talk about the company, technology in general, and the future — stuff we love talking about. Last week they told him they have to stop the chemotherapy, because his body is so weak that it would kill him before the cancer does. I feel like that’s life giving me the (index) finger so I pay attention, because life can give you the (middle) finger anytime.<br/><br/>You live in Japan? Well, where are we going to eat? I’m coming to Tokyo next Wednesday, staying for 10 days in Roppongi. Let’s meet for coffee or food!

I'm especially interested, because making the Nengo GUI was ridiculously hard and we're trying to rewrite it because we had no idea what we were doing the first time (bunch of Python devs writing their first web app). But I also can't find any real prior art for it which I could copy from? I think this is partially because our cognitive modelling system is super restrictive; all communication happens with vectors. When you step away from that restriction, the visualisation and computation domain balloons.

Hi everybody,<br/><br/>I just finished my Master's thesis which focused on Cognitive Modelling. My lab works with brain models, but this requires really weird specialized tools. Like [a reactive GUI](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVeIPKnQAL4&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVeIPKnQAL4&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>) and a [DSL designed for large-scale modelling called SPA](<a href="http://github.com/nengo/nengo-spa">http://github.com/nengo/nengo-spa</a>) with its own type system. It's made me want to make more tools, so I've been following the domain for a while and I'm looking to do a PhD related to it.<br/><br/>Twitter: @voyageur_techno

Hi Steve, hi everyone. I've been following many of you on Twitter for a good while now, and decided it was time to join the Slack group after <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nikolas Martens</span> mentioned it positively in his most recent Zells project log.   <br/><br/>I've lived my entire life in central Alberta, Canada — currently building a house in a remote forest with no phone service and barely any internet.<br/><br/>Life Story (Abridged): I taught myself 3D animation as a kid/teen, which led to a job with a small company in a nearby town that makes some very neat interactive learning media. Over the past decade, I've taught myself to code, and am now the main software dev at the company.<br/><br/>Currently, I'm working on a new suite of tools for our simulation-crafting artists. I want to give them a programming experience that's worthy of being called "Victor-esq", vaguely in the tradition of HyperCard and SmallTalk, loosely inspired by system-centric video games like Factorio or SimCity, with tools as rich and powerful as I'm used to from 3D animation. I'll be sharing progress after I've finished the divergent prototyping phase and start to converge on a specific approach.<br/><br/>I'm also a huge experimental music nerd, so DM me if you want to talk about Max/MSP or Brian Current's "Slanted Time" or Godfried-Willem Raes.  <br/>  <br/>Twitter: <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span>  <br/>Portfolio: <a href="http://spiralganglion.com">spiralganglion.com</a>

Hi, I’m Brian. I’m a grad student working on Sketch-n-Sketch, a bimodal program editor that allows the programmer to edit their plain-text code <em>or</em> to directly manipulate the program’s output and thereby trigger appropriate program updates. Our main target domain is programs that draw SVGs, because for manipulating graphical shapes there’s already a kind of “standard” mouse UI—think Inkscape or PowerPoint or Illustrator—and a first goal was to imitate the basic interactions of such a regular vector graphics editor, although using plain-text code as the underlying representation of the drawing rather than some hidden graphics-specific internal data structure. More broadly the goal is to figure out reasonable ways to back-propagate manipulations on the output into code transformations, and even more broadly the theme is exploring ways to add more direct manipulation interactions to the programming workflow (e.g. mouse manipulations on code as well as on output). Many of the techniques are not specific to SVG and we are looking at alternative domains.
