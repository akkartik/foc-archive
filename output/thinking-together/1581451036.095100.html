<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Deepak Karki</span> the approach of Undo's time traveling debugging is to capture microscopic level of changes. This is a heavy process and would not be normally enabled for a customer running a graphical interactive program. So what would be more desirable is such a lightweight recording technology that it can be enabled at all times, and then if a problem occurs the recording can be transmitted and now you are in an era of 100% repeatable, fixable software. This is the approach i have used in Beads.  But Undo is offering debugging for systems that were never designed for this, which is very clever.
