<b>Call for Workshop Proposals: "Hybrid Live Coding Interfaces: performance and craft"</b><br/><br/>• <b>Permanent link to the call:</b> <a href="https://hybrid-livecode.pubpub.org/pub/nimecfp">https://hybrid-livecode.pubpub.org/pub/nimecfp</a><br/>• <b>Shareable Tweet</b>: <a href="https://twitter.com/jdkarmitage/status/1253625078899761152">https://twitter.com/jdkarmitage/status/1253625078899761152</a><br/>• Venue: <a href="https://nime2020.bcu.ac.uk/">New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) 2020</a>, 21-25 July, Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, United Kingdom (<a href="https://nime2020.bcu.ac.uk/#nime2020update">hosted virtually</a>).<br/>• Format: Research workshop with short ‘lightning’ presentations followed by moderated discussion.<br/>• Time and place: Online, three hour workshop, 21st July 2020 BST. <em>(hours to be decided in response to participant survey).</em><br/>• Proposal deadline: 24th May 2020 AoE.<br/>• Participation fee: Free for all participants and presenters.<br/>• Outcome: Exchange and generation of ideas, new contacts and potential new collaborations.<br/>• Workshop chairs: <br/>• <a href="https://shellyknotts.wordpress.com/">Shelly Knotts</a> (University of Durham).<br/>• <a href="http://www.jackarmitage.com/">Jack Armitage</a> (Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London).<br/>• <a href="https://slab.org/">Alex McLean</a> (Deutsches Museum Research Institute / FoAM Kernow).<br/>• Contact: <a href="mailto:hybridlive_@jarm.is">hybridlive_@jarm.is</a>.<br/>The live coding field has grown over the past 20 years from <a href="http://art.runme.org/1107861145-2780-0/livecoding.pdf">a community of artists and researchers</a> interested in “changing rules while they are followed” -- that is, the creative practice of using a computer programming language as a live interface, mainly in the performing arts. This field has since grown into the international “<a href="https://toplap.org/">TOPLAP</a>” community, with <a href="https://toplap.org/nodes/">dozens of local nodes</a> and offshoots such as <a href="http://algorave.com/">Algorave</a> algorithmic dance music events, with events taking place in over a hundred cities with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/30/is-algorave-the-future-of-dance-music-sheffield-algomech-festival">growing</a> <a href="https://cdm.link/2018/05/inside-the-livecoding-algorave-movement-and-what-it-says-about-music/">media</a> <a href="https://mixmag.net/feature/algorave/4">interest</a>.<br/><br/>Live coders have worked collectively to make their technology and culture accessible, with <a href="https://github.com/toplap/awesome-livecoding#languages">almost all systems shared as free/open source software</a>, and attempts to instill <a href="https://github.com/Algorave/guidelines">inclusivity, diversity</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Algorave/algoraveconduct">safety</a> across organisations and lineups. On this foundation, <a href="https://iclc.toplap.org/">current research</a> in the field is increasingly looking outward, beyond now well-established practices such as <a href="https://algorave.com/">algorave</a>, livecode <a href="https://networkmusicfestival.org/">network music</a> and <a href="http://www.ludions.com/texts/2007a/">slow coding</a>. This includes new interfaces based on old practices including the <a href="https://github.com/jarmitage/Stenophone/">Stenophone</a> made from a court transcription device, a <a href="https://penelope.hypotheses.org/1780">live-codable loom</a> based on ancient weaving technology, and experiments in punk genres such as riot grrrl remixed with live codeable machine listening tools.<br/><br/>This workshop aims to bring together current thinking on how live coding techniques can be combined with other algorithmic practices, and augmented and hybridised with gestural and physical interfaces. A feature of this research is humility, as researchers realise that relatively young computer science innovations have everything to learn from physical interface designs, which have developed through practice over hundreds and perhaps thousands of years. This online workshop explores these themes through discussion and exploration of interfaces and practices.<br/><br/>This is a call for proposals for short demos, talks and other interventions exploring hybrid live coding interfaces in performance and craft.
