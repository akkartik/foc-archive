Hi all (and Davide), I just joined. I found this group because ... well, I assume my story is similar to some of yours: stumbled across the likes of Bret Victor, Alan Kay, etc., realized that software and programming is far from what it should be, and I've been on a quest to improve it. I started my own project for a self-bootstrapping system capable of the engine of it's own modification, both from a programmatic and an end-user perspective. In the process, I found a group of like-minded people who all came out of the cracks when VPRI (a non profit started by Alan Kay) put an end to its mailing list about exploring fundamental new ways of computing. We all suddenly spoke to about our disappointment, and mentioned our own projects and research, and came together to form the following collaboration: <br/><a href="https://github.com/d-cook/SomethingNew">https://github.com/d-cook/SomethingNew</a>
