Without p2p you are beholden to network structures, and without libre software you can't modify your system in the first place. The remaining problem is one of UX, which has largely been ignored as you point out, and is something that should be worked on. But I think making a dichotomy like that is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. \"Person-human-scale\" tools are useless without the structural factors to make them useful—resurrecting hypercard, for  example, is not going to solve the problem of every program you run being monitored by apple or whatever.",

Without p2p you are beholden to network structures, and without libre software you can't modify your system in the first place. The remaining problem is one of UX, which has largely been ignored as you point out, and is something that should be worked on. But I think making a dichotomy like that is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. \"Person-human-scale\" tools are useless without the structural factors to make them useful—resurrecting hypercard, for  example, is not going to solve the problem of every program you run being monitored by apple or whatever."
