Hello, folks. I'm an electrical-turned-embedded engineer focused on remote, low-power monitoring and control systems, mostly in the developing world. I've got an interest in dependable and high-reliability system designs; mainly because the majority of devices using my work are extremely hard to access and update if maintenance is required, so 'pushing an OTA fix' is often out of the question. I've got an interest in applying tools and research to improve the reliability of both designs and delivered software. Some recently interesting examples are Rust, TLA+, and Frama-C.<br/><br/>I got turned on to "Future of Coding" via the Hillel Wayne podcast on formal specifications, and now I'm here. Cheers!
