Aren’t a huge number of apps just fancy views on data in a database, with defined UI idioms to manipulate the data, or the views on it (sorting, filtering, selecting, editing, etc.)? I don’t think this category of apps is much more complex than music production or video editing; I’m tempted to argue that this category of apps is even simpler, but that’s a different discussion. <br/><br/>Sure, there are other categories of use cases that need more sophisticated algorithms and data structures and domain modeling. Why not leave that stuff to expert programmers for now (Hey, at least some of us get to stay employed then), and enable other people to build their own simple apps that just display and manipulate data?<br/>I’m surprised that most attempts at visual programming try to recreate the full power of a programming language. That’s a noble goal, and apparently very difficult, looking at how many times it has been tried over the last half-century.<br/><br/>If the people we want to enable to create apps aren’t programmers anyway, why promising them the full power of a programming language?
