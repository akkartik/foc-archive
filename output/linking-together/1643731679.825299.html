<b>Automated Visual Software Analytics</b><br/>&gt; In this MOOC, we explore how the effectiveness of software development projects can be pro-actively improved by applying concepts, techniques, and tools from software diagnosis. The term “software diagnosis” refers to recently innovated techniques from automated software analysis and software visual analytics that aim at giving insights into information about complex software system implementations, the correlated software development processes, and the system evolution. To this end, all common, traditionally separated infomation sources of software development get automatically extracted, related, and combined. The ultimate goals of these techniques are to provide not only software engineers but also all other stakeholders better instruments to monitor, to comprehend, to discuss, and to steer software development activities. In particular we will investigate how “software maps” as cartography-oriented, general-purpose, powerful visual analytics instruments can be used to improve software development effectiveness and transparency.<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdmaUqnmrw0&amp;list=PLoOmvuyo5UAfyyE3b5eRaDjRAD7u8vl1R&amp;index=1">Intro Video</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoOmvuyo5UAfyyE3b5eRaDjRAD7u8vl1R">Full playlist</a>
