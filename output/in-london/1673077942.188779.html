Not yet, but there will likely be a pub hangout towards the end of the month - I’ll set a date by next week.<br/><br/>Hoping to do another demo-based meetup at Newspeak house in February (similar to the November one) but currently figuring out how to make funding work - eg. need £££ for pizza and drinks for everyone when we do it at non-pub locations.<br/><br/>Currently debating between setting up a fund on open collective (<a href="https://opencollective.com/">https://opencollective.com/</a>) and scouting for sponsors. Ideally the latter since the former looks like it could get complex with accounting and taxes (even if it’s just everyone pays £5 in and we use it for food).<br/><br/>If anyone knows of companies who might be willing to sponsor a couple meetups a year, send them my way!
