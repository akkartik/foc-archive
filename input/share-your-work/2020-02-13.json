Every tool that tries to show multiple dimensions simultaneously will bump into this horrible screensize constraint. We are in the dark ages of programming where it hasn't been realized that we need wall sized screens with 10x the number of pixels we currently have. Apple is leading the way forward in pixel count, but because they are increasing the density not the size of the screen (their iMac Pro for example tops out at a mere 27 inches), they cheat and pixel double, so their 5000 pixels across is actually on 2500 in practice, which is nothing fancy.

I just saw a Samsung phone demoed that has 12 GB of RAM, so i imagine in the future you will wirelessly dock your phone with some giant monitor grid and work that way.
