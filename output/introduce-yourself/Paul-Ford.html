Hello, friends. I am the co-founder of a digital product studio in NYC called Postlight, and sometimes write/podcast about technology. Like many here I am a big Bret Victor fan and also enjoy reading up on the history of programming languages/development environments/workstations. I do find myself drifting towards agent-based and simulation tools lately, mostly for fun, particularly NetLogo, and I'm also very interested in sound synthesis livecoding, even though I don't have any musical talent. I'll lurk for a while before saying much so I can understand how things go here.
