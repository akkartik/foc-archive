Because of the litigation by Oracle over the Java API for obvious reasons the web companies do not credit MacroMedia (which was purchase by Adobe) that created Actionscript 2. The tragedy is that in AS3 they added strong typing, and it was a far better language after that addition, including a nice module system. Too bad ES 2016 modules didn't quite fully implement the AS3 module system. Forget the myths about it was developed it 2 weeks; it was a clone of a long-gestating, very popular scripting language that was the source of the original CDROM revolution of \"multimedia\" content (Macromedia Director with the Lingo language being the first popular multimedia authoring tool). Gradually JS has added in many of AS3's feature sets although the omission of strong typing is sorely missed. I have a small editing script that with a few dozen regular expressions can convert AS3 to JS at a 99% level. Steve Jobs and MS ganged up at one point to attack Adobe, trying to destroy their font business, and Adobe counterattacked with a suite of products that today is one of the best (and most expensive).",

Because of the litigation by Oracle over the Java API for obvious reasons the web companies do not credit MacroMedia (which was purchase by Adobe) that created Actionscript 2. The tragedy is that in AS3 they added strong typing, and it was a far better language after that addition, including a nice module system. Too bad ES 2016 modules didn't quite fully implement the AS3 module system. Forget the myths about it was developed it 2 weeks; it was a clone of a long-gestating, very popular scripting language that was the source of the original CDROM revolution of \"multimedia\" content (Macromedia Director with the Lingo language being the first popular multimedia authoring tool). Gradually JS has added in many of AS3's feature sets although the omission of strong typing is sorely missed. I have a small editing script that with a few dozen regular expressions can convert AS3 to JS at a 99% level. Steve Jobs and MS ganged up at one point to attack Adobe, trying to destroy their font business, and Adobe counterattacked with a suite of products that today is one of the best (and most expensive)."
