Dusted off an old project from 2021; a programmable audio sequencer. It stalled because there was no good way to store state in Observable, but with Lopecode, there is! Notebooks can write back into their own FileAttachments, which are bundled when exporting. So I just added some serialisation code and suddenly that project is much more useful. You can actually save the good settings as a hermetic file, completely sure that no external software changes will ever damage that moment in time.
