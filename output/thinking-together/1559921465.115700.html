<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Doug Moen</span> I will check out Curv - sounds promising from what you say. I will check it out as I have almost certainly tarred the whole of FP with the Haskell brush.<br/><br/>I am struggling to find a clip from a talk that I think is relevant to support what I am saying. I think it is possibly in an Eve retrospective by Chris Granger. Basically the speaker talks about demoing a "new programming" type product to highly intelligent non-programmers. The user was easily able to whip up something fairly complex (so far so good!) but then they ran into a problem where they said something like (pointing) "I want this value... here".<br/><br/>The value they wanted "there" was calculated deep inside nested functions and there was no way to "just move that value there" without a massive refactor.<br/><br/>The speaker talks about how deflating this experience was because they realised it wasn't even easy to explain <b>why</b> they couldn't do that without introducing a ton of concepts like scope and stacks and whatever i.e. exactly what they wanted to avoid!<br/><br/>I have experienced similar things with my wife who is clever and accomplished in a non-programming field. I can't even explain to her why I'm finding something difficult. I'll just be like (I need these numbers to in <b>this</b> window). This is <b>not</b> the same as algorithm challenges like Google Code Jam, where she can immediately understand why it is fundamentally hard to describe the solution, and might even be able to describe a solution with words and pictures herself.
