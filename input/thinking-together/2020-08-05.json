Also, empty strings are bad. Yes. Think about this: we've had the concept of 'zero' for 1000s of years but only very recently added the concept of 'empty string' - why? Could it be mainly for modeling in computers? There is no zero-like symbol you can write in a paper form where text is expected. Yes you could write `N\/A` but that conflates null and \"\". Sometimes you might be asked to write _why_ it is `N\/A`.\n\nConsider that there are valid questions for which the _meaningful_ _answer_ is zero: \"How many toilet paper rolls are there in the store?\", \"What is the temperature of the snow?\" etc. There are no questions where the 'empty string' answer has a clear-cut meaning: \"What is your spouse's name?\", \"What city do you live in?\" etc. What does an answer of `\"\"` mean? It could mean _\"I don't know\"_ or _\"I dont want to tell you\"_ or _\"There isn't one\"_. Can these always be mapped to null or \"\"? I don't think so.\n\nIn type systems that have both, the empty string and null, you end up with the question of 'what does null mean' vs 'what does empty string mean'. Sometimes when you have two missing values in the world that you want to model - you end up mapping these to '' and null. But really this has nothing to do with a generic solution - it's often just a reality twisted to fit the types. If you want to model _three_ missing values e.g. 'unknown', 'non-existent', 'secret\/intentionally-blank' - how do you map these to \"\" and null? Maybe the best solution here is to model the value as an enum? `unknown, non_existent, intentionally_blank, value(real_string_here)` . AFAIK no systems, languages have a great solution. However I feel better solutions lie in exploring the 'information modeling' space - RDF etc (perhaps with some kind of versioned schemas to describe what is possible and necessary.) Basically we don't want multiple data representations to correspond to a single reality (which is what happens in null vs \"\", or sometimes with nested `option&lt;option&lt;option&lt;t&gt;&gt;&gt;`).",

For example I really enjoyed the FoC episode on Orca but at some point I needed to stop and research what Orca was. And a lot of 99 Percent Invisible episodes come with an attached article with visual references.\n\nMaybe there's an opportunity here to allow me to stop what I'm doing and have a quick glimpse at my phone to get a visual reference (eg. an Orca gif) so the podcast can continue uninterrupted.",

So I feel like this runs against the grain of what makes podcasts successful.\n\nHowever, I agree that podcasts do lack these features. For example I really enjoyed the FoC episode on Orca but at some point I needed to stop and research what Orca was. And a lot of 99 Percent Invisible episodes come with an attached article with visual references.\n\nMaybe there's an opportunity here to allow me to stop what I'm doing and have a quick glimpse at my phone to get a visual reference (eg. an Orca gif) so the podcast can continue uninterrupted."

Social context, technical context, economic context. Shipping a rendering engine with an HTML file would be a technical nightmare. Programming still happens in text files because text files are an incredibly durable, universal format that can be passed around to dozens of auxiliary tools (e.g. code review -- see why everybody hates collaborating on Jupyter).\n\nThese talks are still obviously insightful, both for reminding us of computing history, and pointing out important issues in the status quo. But I’m always extremely skeptical when they don’t address _why_ programming became the way it is. I have yet to see a talk that grapples with the messy reality of the world, how we have to daily work with huge systems coded by thousands of people who we barely trust. Gone are the days where 10 smart people at PARC can hack together an OS themselves with absolutely no concerns for security, accessibility, backwards-compatibility, …\n\nI would love to see more visions for FoC that take these realities into account.",

Social context, technical context, economic context. Shipping a rendering engine with an HTML file would be a technical nightmare. Programming still happens in text files because text files are an incredibly durable, universal format that can be passed around to dozens of auxiliary tools (e.g. code review -- see why everybody hates collaborating on Jupyter).\n\nThese talks are still obviously insightful, both for reminding us of computing history, and pointing out important issues in the status quo. But I’m always extremely skeptical when they don’t address "
