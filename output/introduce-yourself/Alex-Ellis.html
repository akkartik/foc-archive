Hello! My name's Alex. I used to be a mathematician (representation theory, category theory, and topology). I've been at Quora the past 3.5 years working on machine learning (recommendation systems, then later NLP; as an engineer, later as a manager). Communication and writing have been forms of thought for me for a long time: in math and programming, but also in other areas of interest (meditation, philosophy, language, psychology, ...). I'm interested in learning what folks are working on in this area and to discuss ideas and projects.
