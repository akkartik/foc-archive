This was going to be a reply to Yair, but I decided to break it out so that more people would see it and have the chance to weigh in.<br/><br/>Here are my reasons for being against the creation of subject-specific channels. Please show me the error of my ways, or voice support, or suggest alternative ways we could support more subject-centric discussion that limits the bad kind of fervor.<br/><br/>• Most people here in this community are (or would benefit from being) interested in <em>everything.</em><br/>• Fewer channels are easier to follow, which is important if you are interested in everything.<br/>• Every existing person will need to be told about each new channel. Lots of people check the slack infrequently and miss those messages, even after multiple repeats.<br/>• Each new person will need to be told about all existing channels. We haven't yet found a good way to do this, other than including channels in the default set. Having a lot of default channels can be overwhelming. People already need to learn that things like #share-your-work, #, and #two-minute-week have special rules, so I want to avoid making the newcomer experience even more intense.<br/>• New people might not know that the point of subject-specific channels is that they're "safe spaces" for true believers :), so this will need to be communicated too.<br/>• Whenever we do want to have a discussion about the merits of (say) FP vs logic programming, that stuff will still end up in #thinking-together, because the subject channels are safe spaces. So we've kept all our flame wars front-and-center and moved the more thoughtful discussions off to the sidelines.<br/>• When posting something interesting that intersects multiple interests, you need to make a decision about which channel to post it in. Some people post to general. Some people post to a subject channel. Some do both. None of these are <em>great</em>.
