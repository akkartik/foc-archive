Hi, I contribute to the game engine Godot Engine.  We cater to the surface level understanding of the game designers who barely code, to the gameplay developers who care about games than the complexity of a rendering engine, to the game engine developers who have to provide understanding of all the cases but don't have bandwidth to dedicate to being a gameplay developer.<br/><br/>In Godot Engine, we have several coding interfaces. C++ core, C++ as a shared library GDNative, GDScript which is a custom python-like game script,  and Visual Script which is a Node and Wire graphical editor. <a href="https://godotengine.org/">https://godotengine.org/</a><br/><br/>I and a Google summer of code student have been improving Visual Script from it's current unusable state. <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/gsoc-2019-progress-report-3#visual-scripting">https://godotengine.org/article/gsoc-2019-progress-report-3#visual-scripting</a> The work has been done, but it's not fully merged yet. Godot Engine is not just capable of games, imagine using a single executable editor / game for other things!

Hope to join the community, and maybe improve what Godot Engine has even more!
