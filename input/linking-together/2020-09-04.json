It's a case of incremental improvement vs. fundamental new understanding.\n\nThe former is much more common because it's \"easier to reach in the search space.\" I think this is another way to state \"failure is manifold\" from <@USH01JEDQ>'s comment.\n\nI don't think all future technology can be predicted this way. There is a class of technological evolution that breaks out of such local optima. Using the nuclear example again, the shift from combustion to \"understanding and harnessing of the atom\", was such an event.",
