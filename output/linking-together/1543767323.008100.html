Today I learned about site called "Un-code Mania" where "un" rhymes with "boon".  It was a Japanese site where it's a pun because "unko" means "shit" so "un-code" was shit code. It was a site where you post code you think is crap and people shit :hankey:vote it. The more :hankey:votes the worse the code.<br/><br/>Of course at first it sounds like a joke and it is, but, it also serves as a place to look at code people judge as bad and hopefully learn why it's bad.<br/><br/>I'm only guessing the reason it is offline is that most people who want to post bad code probably saw that code at work and if they post it might get the site in trouble. Just a guess.<br/><br/>Apparently you could also judge the code as "Hiyo-code" which is another pun as "Hiyoko" means baby chicken. Putting this mark meant code by a beginner but fixable.<br/><br/>Anyway, it brought up interesting thoughts given it provides a chance to understand why some code is judged as bad
