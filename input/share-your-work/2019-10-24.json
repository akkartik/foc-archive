To erase the screen you had to press a zap button. The image was rock solid though, as it was etched in slow phosphors, so no flicker at all... It came with two clumsy thumbwheels for XY input, before they had trackballs and mice. Even more astonishing, it had a thermal printer that printed the screen for you in grayscale in a few seconds. Developed for the military, it was such great gear, and Tektronix was and probably still is a great company with excellent products.",

It had an incredible 4000 x 3000 pixels, easily 10x what other devices had at the time. To erase the screen you had to press a zap button. The image was rock solid though, as it was etched in slow phosphors, so no flicker at all... It came with two clumsy thumbwheels for XY input, before they had trackballs and mice. Even more astonishing, it had a thermal printer that printed the screen for you in grayscale in a few seconds. Developed for the military, it was such great gear, and Tektronix was and probably still is a great company with excellent products."
