They may be totally invisible in the video but objects in Automat now drop shadows! They're drawn using fairly sophisticated procedures that were developed a copule of years ago for Google's Material Design system. Each object actually drops two different shadows - one coming from environmental light (a.k.a. ambient occlusion) and one from directional light (which is modelled as a disk with the same width as window and is positioned in 3d space roughly in front of the title bar). The cool thing about those shadows is that they're not using either shadow maps nor gaussian blurs (except concave shapes). The library takes some shape (vector contour of the object dropping shadow) + parameters of the light and computes a physically based analytical shadow mesh that is then drawn in the background. This manages to render fairly realistic shadows even while elevation of objects is being dynamically changed.

Do you have a link to that shadow meshing library? I'd love to read more about it.

Sure: <a href="https://skia.googlesource.com/skia/+/2e551697dc56/src/utils/SkShadowUtils.cpp">https://skia.googlesource.com/skia/+/2e551697dc56/src/utils/SkShadowUtils.cpp</a> <br/>There is very little to read about it unfortunately and the official documentation is just dire. I've found about it at some Android Developer podcast some years ago (can't really tell which one unfortunately) where its author described it in more detail. I've had good experiences contacting the library authors through <a href="mailto:skia-discuss@google.com">skia-discuss@google.com</a> - if you're interested in digging deeper. Here is one code sample (should be editable): <a href="https://fiddle.skia.org/c/4fe859580ed911500608c35928d92d72">https://fiddle.skia.org/c/4fe859580ed911500608c35928d92d72</a>
