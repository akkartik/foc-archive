Jimmy Webb is one of the top songwriters of my generation.  We are truly lucky to have a recording of an interview of Jimmy Webb done by someone who has a clue and had the balls to stump up his own money to make it happen.<br/><br/>Why should you care?<br/><br/>Quantization is not the only way to deep dive into a subject. Developing theories about monads will never help you create content as good as what Jimmy Webb created.  No type-checked language is ever going to touch as many humans as “The Witchitaw Lineman”.  An interesting question is “Why?“.  I think that Raskin’s “The Humane Interface” was just beginning to scratch the surface of this question, along with Norman’s “The Design of Everyday Things”.<br/><br/>In songwriting, there is the concept of “co-writing”.  1+1=3.  The best creations come from teams of people with <b>complementary</b> skills.  Everybody in the room gets an equal cut.  Isolationist songwriters sometimes succeed, but co-writing teams succeed more often.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8pRKAgMaP4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8pRKAgMaP4</a>

I don't really see the link to typed languages here, can you elaborate?

I apologize for the lengthy delay in replying...<br/><br/>Deep type checking addresses only a tiny sliver of the problem (i.e. DX for Optimization) yet is worshipped as The Silver Bullet that will do away with the need for Iteration and Creativity (ad-hoc combination of ideas) to create Real Solutions.  50+ years later, Reality shows that this is not the case, and, that deep type checking itself is designed through iteration and ad-hocery.<br/><br/>Creation of solutions to Real problems (UX) requires, at least<br/>1. Design<br/>2. Engineering<br/>3. Production Engineering (Optimization).<br/>Design and Engineering have been effectively abandoned and relegated to relatively feeble approaches, such as Agile.
