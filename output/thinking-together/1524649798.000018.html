I see what you mean. Another interesting thing right where you linked into the video is how he creates the grid of independent polygons. He found a way to start with a plane, increase the polygon count, then use a bezel feature to create the gaps. That’s a hack! In the sense of “using a tool for a different purpose than it was created for” and it works brilliantly. I’m sure there are tons of other ways to get to the same grid of square polygons, but that one is probably quite efficient.<br/><br/>I think that's also an important property of a good tool. With creativity you can find new ways to use the tool that hasn’t been part of the initial design. Not everything has to be designed by the creator of the tool. But that is often how we as software engineers approach it.<br/><br/>This let's us as programmers without domain knowledge get a little bit “off the hook”. If we design tools good enough to be useful, but abstract enough to be somewhat generic (open to other use cases and interpretations), and combine that with ways to compose different tools together, we can enable regular users (who have the domain knowledge) to find new ways of using them; ideally coming up with better ideas like the “create a grid” shortcut in the video.<br/><br/>You can find examples like this in music production as well as spreadsheets; even in things like Twitter, where creative users started to come up with conventions for retweets and tweet storms, until they became proper features.
