Hi, I'm Charlie from Cambridge, MA. I'm a programmer turned high school computer science teacher and I'm primarily interested in how kids learn to code. I write on the topic on my blog (some relevant posts <a href="https://blog.charliemeyer.co/code-doesnt-happen-to-you/">here</a> and <a href="https://blog.charliemeyer.co/errors-are-not-failures/">here</a>) and I'm working on a project for a new structured editor for beginners. My hypothesis is that we can get more people excited about programming by making it easier for beginners to make projects they care about.<br/><br/>I would love to chat with anyone in the education/structured editor space and share notes!

Hey, Charlie: Love your blog posts. I write software that is supposed to let lawyers and public policy experts use code to do complicated things, and to do that I use block programming libraries that were originally intended to make coding easy for children. It turns out, children are people, and if you make coding easier for children, you have made coding easier for other people, too. :slightly_smiling_face: So I think we are essentially working on the same problem.
