<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span> about graphs.  Yes, you're right about Graphs being trivially converted into free categories.  For non-free categories, you add in path equations "going this way is the same as going that way."<br/><br/>Graphs don't work so well for "dense" categories.  For instance, take rational numbers under â‰¤.  It's not free on a graph since any arrow is the composition of... well... many non-trivial ones.  BUT dense categories don't exactly come up a lot.<br/><br/>Also the Graphical Linear Algebra String Diagrams are related to but distinct from the objects as nodes and arrows as edges graphs.  Um, uh, here's a picture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram</a> that shows something... complicated is going on.
