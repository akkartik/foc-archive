Hey all, I'm Abdiel Lopez, you can call me Del (since its the only nickname anyone can come up with). I help consume food, and make courses on CS and Gamedev in my spare time.<br/><br/>I am passionate about the possibilities and future tech that has yet to be tested in the gamedev area. I found that through teaching I could advance the future of software faster than if I just tried to make that future myself.

hey Abdiel!<br/><br/>&gt;  I found that through teaching I could advance the future of software faster than if I just tried to make that future myself<br/>Wow this resonated so much with me and that’s in some ways how I see myself. I’ve mostly been a technical educator for the last ~4-5 years, instead of a full-time engineer and have been pushing for better tools &amp; media (my interest is specifically in data tools)
