I'm also not, in a million years, going to try to design a programming system that stands up to the demands of having business software built in it. That camp is _over there_, and I'm _over here_, and never the two shall meet.\n\nBut there's more possibility space here than just _business software_ and _research faff_. One of the more serious domains that does seem to have some overlap with my desires for aliveness is electrical engineering. EEs bend physics, and physics is the biggest cheese-mover in the room. When they get deep enough in the sauce, EEs need to <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/live\/ySuUZEjARPY?feature=shared&t=741|grapple with all sorts of wildness>. I think it'd be possible to make something that feels alive while being truer to the laws of physics than most software is, in a way that'd make EEs feel at home. (I'm not interested in doing this, but it's worth thinking about.)\n\n<@UKLV35EEM> is also a big proponent of getting away from worries about consistency and determinism, and I think his reasoning is rock solid — when you start doing things spread-out in space (or time), you need to deal with some inherent, inescapable nondeterminism, and the only scalable choice is to just lean into that and see what you can do with it, see if you can dance with it and bend it into a beautiful bow, weave it into your hair and come up with a meal plan where you balance nondeterminism with other kinds of fibre.
