I don’t pretend to know which alternatives would be better (and like to think there doesn’t need to be a single answer) but the explanations for the success of software and the failure of alternatives always seemed pretty underwhelming, often leaning on the fact that software _did succeed_ as proof of its own_._ However_,_ finding an argument to be weak isn’t really an explanation, even if it suggests the need for one.\n\nRecently I was wondering if there is explanatory power in “Conways Law” if applied to large socio-technical systems. Conway was thinking about the internal structure of software as produced within an organisation in <http:\/\/www.melconway.com\/Home\/pdf\/committees.pdf|How Committees Invent>. The paper has much more nuance, but the adage roughly states: \n\n&gt; Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure\nIf we apply this line of thinking to computation at large, we might ask questions on the impact of communication mechanisms inherent to capitalism and their structuring effect on the computing landscape. This maps quite well to software, as there is often a correspondence between software production and individual firms. We might imagine a different economy (e.g. some highly federated, anarchist society) and think of what the organisation of computing might look like. This is something I think is interesting to explore on its own, but it lead to a different idea I find quite compelling:\n\nThat the success of software is a result of a drive to make computing economically “legible” to capitalism. \n(I’m appropriating legibility here from James C. Scott’s <https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/j.ctt1nq3vk|Seeing Like a State>)\n\nThis makes some sense as an explanation for software, but it might also offer a new explanation for things like app stores among others. \n• Platforms could be seen as (among other things) exertion of control of legibility, where legibility is much higher for those who control the system (e.g. Amazons view of their own services vs a users view).\n• The apparent success of software over alternatives such as open document systems, or composable (non-software) GUI systems, or \"computational media\" efforts, *might be explained as not a technical or conceptual success, but as providing legibility that alternatives lack.*\n• More interestingly to me, is wether legibility is even something desirable in the first place.\n[This is a slightly rehashed line of thinking I passed around at work that I thought might be interesting to this crowd. This isn’t thought through, so just read it as casual speculation. But I *do* think we need an explanation, if we are ever to move beyond this current way of interacting with digital systems]",

This maps quite well to software, as there is often a correspondence between software production and individual firms. We might imagine a different economy (e.g. some highly federated, anarchist society) and think of what the organisation of computing might look like. This is something I think is interesting to explore on its own, but it lead to a different idea I find quite compelling:"

Sandboxing each app by itself, like on iOS or Android, is much easier than allowing untrusted code from multiple sources to all coexist in the same object space, in the Smalltalk or Open doc or NewtonScript sense.\n\nI think we could learn something from multiuser games here, since they've been dealing with the issue of letting untrusted bits of code from multiple sources interact with each other for a long time. Second Life, LambdaMOO, LP Mud, and object capability systems all seem like potential sources of inspiration here."
