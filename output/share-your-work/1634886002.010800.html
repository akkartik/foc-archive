<b>Annotated Lambda Diagrams:</b><br/><br/>I have an idea for a semi-graphical programming interface that<br/>as far as I can tell is very different from anything that is currently in existence.<br/>I call it:  »Annotated Lambda Diagrams (ALDs)«<br/><br/>The core of the idea is to annotate John Trumps "Lambda Diagrams"<br/>( see here: <a href="https://tromp.github.io/cl/diagrams.html">https://tromp.github.io/cl/diagrams.html</a> )<br/>in order to make them into a practically useful and enjoyable programming user interface. (Hopefully even live coding capable).<br/><br/>Don't be tricked into grouping this together with node editors.<br/>While there are visual line and box elements, this is definitely not a node editor.<br/>That is because there simply are no nodes here.<br/><br/>What may look like nodes are merely redundant tags/annotations of the lines.<br/>As such there is no need to decide<br/>— which one of wires and nodes represents values and<br/>— which one represents value-transforming-functions<br/>So these ALDs are also not to confuse with what could be called "inverse node editors" where the roles of lines and nodes are swapped from the usual association. Also note that having functions being first class values does not remove this issue of node editors … as far as I can see.<br/><br/><b>Here is a writeup of the basic idea:</b><br/>• :fire: <a href="http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram">http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram</a><br/><b>Here is a page with further Mockups:</b><br/>• :fire: <a href="http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram_mockups">http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram_mockups</a> <br/>Drawing these mockups by hand (in inkscape) is a lot of effort.<br/>But implementing this even more so.<br/>I did not get very far in my first attempt. To put it mildly.<br/>I didn't even get to implementing the actual diagrams …<br/>Zooming programming interface experiment:<br/>• Take1/2: <a href="https://youtu.be/VcoBaUDSHFM">https://youtu.be/VcoBaUDSHFM</a><br/>• Take2/2: <a href="https://youtu.be/YWUBRyDAVG4">https://youtu.be/YWUBRyDAVG4</a>
