One thing I discovered about *Luma, which may be useful for anyone currently on the waitlist*, is that if you put yourself on the waitlist and a ticket becomes available then *you don't automatically get assigned that ticket* and you don't get a notification saying that a ticket is available. So, luckily I was monitoring the event page from another browser that wasn't logged in, which enabled me to discover there was a spare ticket. And I had to cancel my waitlist space (and reload the page) in order register for a ticket, which felt a little risky, but I was obviously quick enough! :wink: I have been educated that there is more than one way to code a waitlist! :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: Look forward to meeting up!",
