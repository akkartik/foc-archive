AI-coding (chat) to create UIs — working software you can own — is the "worse is better" existential threat to traditional design tools and no-code.<br/><br/>This is as big, or bigger, than the "worse is better" that JavaScript pulled off for the Internet.<br/><br/>Chat is slow, but it gets the job done in a super accessible way, hence the "worse is better".<br/><br/>The real prize will be to combine the best parts of chat with the best parts of the canvas in design tools / no-code tools.

Absolutely. I agree completely. And I am stoked that LLMs are about <b>text,</b> but accessible (because it's natural language adapted to the situation, and you can ask questions to it).<br/><br/>And, as you say, the canvas needs to be right there too, to see what you're doing with all that text. No context switching. This is reminiscent of Netscape being the bomb when it launched because it could show images right there on the page (no context switching!).
