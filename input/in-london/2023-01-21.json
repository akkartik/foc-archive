Format will be the same as November’s event: demos, drinks, pizza, and plenty of time to chat. We’ll have a bunch of FoC-ers presenting their projects.\nIf you’d like to present, please DM me on <https:\/\/twitter.com\/mappletons|Twitter> or email <mailto:hello@maggieappleton.com|hello@maggieappleton.com>. It can be anywhere from 5 to 15 mins long, and can be about anything that feels FoC-ish: new ideas for programming interfaces, thoughts on humane computing, things you’ve learned about end-user programming. Small, weird talks are welcome!",
