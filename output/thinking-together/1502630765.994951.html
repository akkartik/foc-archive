Here's some discussion of visual programming languages on this reddit post about a node based microcontroller language <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6t0d7w/give_a_chance_to_a_visual_programming_language/">https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6t0d7w/give_a_&hellip;</a> <br/><br/>there were some comments I found interesting about how it was hard to keep things organized as programs became more complicated with reference to LabVIEW.  Maybe relevant to your work <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Paul Biggar</span> and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tim Babb</span>.  I'm not familiar with LabVIEW, but I think it'll be important to make it easy to traverse different levels of abstraction maybe by zooming in and out on components/nodes. <br/><br/>"I used LabVIEW for a few months and found it great for simple stuff like a sending values over serial with a bit of logic. Once you got any more complex with data processing and introduced a GUI, it became a horrible spaghetti mess."<br/><br/>"Pretty much my experience too except I found basic GUIs to be very easy in LabVIEW. My issue was that once your program went to tiny to small, it became much harder to keep the program clear and understandable."<br/><br/>Also this comment "The main problem with visual languages is that our primary input device is a text oriented one. I have a feeling that visual languages would work better on tablets and similar touch based devices, although it most likely also need programmers who are able to break free from thinking in terms of text."  is one of the reasons I think VR hand controllers are interesting as a means for input
