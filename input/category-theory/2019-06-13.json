I’ve been learning category theory for the last few weeks trying a few different approaches and found resources that work well for me. If you’re interested here's my current “curriculum”: <https:\/\/gist.github.com\/stefanlesser\/7f0749b3a38078b3eebe0cc408345e9f>\n\nIs anybody here interested in forming a (virtual?) study group? I noticed how much more effective it is to talk to people about it. Would be great to find people who are actually interested in me explaining it to them. ;-) Obviously, I’d also be very interested in having others explain it to me as well.\n\nPretty open about the structure. Could be sort of a book club working through the resources, weekly video calls to discuss and explain to each other, share exercise results, or even do “pair programming” on the exercises. Whatever you feel comfortable with and are interested in. However, you should be genuinely interested in putting some effort into it, which maybe means you can commit to read a few chapters a week and then meet online to discuss them.\n\nMy goal is to build intuitive understanding for category theory concepts and its applications. I’m less interested in learning all the proofs and more in what it means that for instance natural transformations map to parametric polymorphism and what we can use these kinds of insights for to create better programming languages and environments. I’ve made it far enough to totally believe in but not yet far enough to know how to take advantage of the Eric Weinstein quote:\n&gt;“Theoretical mathematicians are sitting on top of a giant stockpile of intellectual gold. They have so many things that have not been manifested anywhere. You have no idea how much great stuff that these priests have in their monastery.”\nwhich is on the Conexus website that <@UJK8MKYAZ> linked to above. \n\nReply here or DM me.",

                "text": "In the previous installment of Categories for Programmers, Categories Great and Small, I gave a few examples of simple categories. In this installment we&rsquo;ll work through a more advanced example. If you&rsquo;re new to the series, here&rsquo;s the Table of Contents.\nComposition of Logs\nYou&rsquo;ve seen how to model types and pure functions as a category. I also mentioned that there is a way to model side effects, or non-pure functions, in category theory. Let&rsquo;s have a look at one such example: functions that log or trace their execution. Something that, in an imperative language, would likely be implemented by mutating some global state, as in:\nstring logger;\n\nbool negate(bool b) {\n     logger += \"Not so! \";\n     return !b;\n}\nYou know that this is not a pure function, because its memoized version would fail to produce a log. This function has side effects.\nIn modern programming, we try to stay away from global mutable state as much as possible &mdash; if only because of the complications of concurrency. And you would never put code like this in a library.\nFortunately for us, it&rsquo;s possible to make this function pure. You just have to pass the log explicitly, in and out. Let&rsquo;s do that by adding a string argument, and pairing regular output with a string that contains the updated log:\npairstring&gt; negate(bool b, string logger) {\n     return make_pair(!b, logger + \"Not so! \");\n}\nThis function is pure, it has no side effects, it returns the same pair every time it&rsquo;s called with the same arguments, and it can be memoized if necessary. However, considering the cumulative nature of the log, you&rsquo;d have to memoize all possible histories that can lead to a given call. There would be a separate memo entry for:\nnegate(true, \"It was the best of times. \");\nand\nnegate(true, \"It was the worst of times. \");\nand so on.\nIt&rsquo;s also not a very good interface for a library function. The callers are free to ignore the string in the return type, so that&rsquo;s not a huge burden; but they are forced to pass a string as input, which might be inconvenient.\nIs there a way to do the same thing less intrusively? Is there a way to separate concerns? In this simple example, the main purpose of the function negate is to turn one Boolean into another. The logging is secondary. Granted, the message that is logged is specific to the function, but the task of aggregating the messages into one continuous log is a separate concern. We still want the function to produce a string, but we&rsquo;d like to unburden it from producing a log. So here&rsquo;s the compromise solution:\npair negate(bool b) {\n     return make_pair(!b, \"Not so! \");\n}\nThe idea is that the log will be aggregated between function calls.\nTo see how this can be done, let&rsquo;s switch to a slightly more realistic example. We have one function from string to string that turns lower case characters to upper case:\nstring toUpper(string s) {\n    string result;\n    int (*toupperp)(int) = &amp;toupper; \/\/ toupper is overloaded\n    transform(begin(s), end(s), back_inserter(result), toupperp);\n    return result;\n}\nand another that splits a string into a vector of strings, breaking it on whitespace boundaries:\nvector toWords(string s) {\n    return words(s);\n}\nThe actual work is done in the auxiliary function words:\nvector words(string s) {\n    vector result{\"\"};\n    for (auto i = begin(s); i != end(s); ++i)\n    {\n        if (isspace(*i))\n            result.push_back(\"\");\n        else\n            result.back() += *i;\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nWe want to modify the functions toUpper and toWords so that they piggyback a message string on top of their regular return values.\nWe will &ldquo;embellish&rdquo; the return values of these functions. Let&rsquo;s do it in a generic way by defining a template Writer that encapsulates a pair whose first component is a value of arbitrary type A and the second component is a string:\ntemplate\nusing Writer = pair;\nHere are the embellished functions:\nWriter toUpper(string s) {\n    string result;\n    int (*toupperp)(int) = &amp;toupper;\n    transform(begin(s), end(s), back_inserter(result), toupperp);\n    return make_pair(result, \"toUpper \");\n}\n\nWriter&gt; toWords(string s) {\n    return make_pair(words(s), \"toWords \");\n}\nWe want to compose these two functions into another embellished function that uppercases a string and splits it into words, all the while producing a log of those actions. Here&rsquo;s how we may do it:\nWriter&gt; process(string s) {\n    auto p1 = toUpper(s);\n    auto p2 = toWords(p1.first);\n    return make_pair(p2.first, p1.second + p2.second);\n}\nWe have accomplished our goal: The aggregation of the log is no longer the concern of the individual functions. They produce their own messages, which are then, externally, concatenated into a larger log.\nNow imagine a whole program written in this style. It&rsquo;s a nightmare of repetitive, error-prone code. But we are programmers. We know how to deal with repetitive code: we abstract it! This is, however, not your run of the mill abstraction &mdash; we have to abstract function composition itself. But composition is the essence of category theory, so before we write more code, let&rsquo;s analyze the problem from the categorical point of view.\nThe Writer Category\nThe idea of embellishing the return types of a bunch of functions in order to piggyback some additional functionality turns out to be very fruitful. We&rsquo;ll see many more examples of it. The starting point is our regular category of types and functions. We&rsquo;ll leave the types as objects, but redefine our morphisms to be the embellished functions.\nFor instance, suppose that we want to embellish the function isEven that goes from int to bool. We turn it into a morphism that is represented by an embellished function. The important point is that this morphism is still considered an arrow between the objects int and bool, even though the embellished function returns a pair:\npair isEven(int n) {\n     return make_pair(n % 2 == 0, \"isEven \");\n}\nBy the laws of a category, we should be able to compose this morphism with another morphism that goes from the object bool to whatever. In particular, we should be able to compose it with our earlier negate:\npair negate(bool b) {\n     return make_pair(!b, \"Not so! \");\n}\nObviously, we cannot compose these two morphisms the same way we compose regular functions, because of the input\/output mismatch. Their composition should look more like this:\npair isOdd(int n) {\n    pair p1 = isEven(n);\n    pair p2 = negate(p1.first);\n    return make_pair(p2.first, p1.second + p2.second);\n}\nSo here&rsquo;s the recipe for the composition of two morphisms in this new category we are constructing:\nExecute the embellished function corresponding to the first morphism\nExtract the first component of the result pair and pass it to the embellished function corresponding to the second morphism\nConcatenate the second component (the string) of of the first result and the second component (the string) of the second result\nReturn a new pair combining the first component of the final result with the concatenated string.\nIf we want to abstract this composition as a higher order function in C++, we have to use a template parameterized by three types corresponding to three objects in our category. It should take two embellished functions that are composable according to our rules, and return a third embellished function:\ntemplate\nfunction(A)&gt; compose(function(A)&gt; m1, \n                               function(B)&gt; m2)\n{\n    return [m1, m2](A x) {\n        auto p1 = m1(x);\n        auto p2 = m2(p1.first);\n        return make_pair(p2.first, p1.second + p2.second);\n    };\n}\nNow we can go back to our earlier example and implement the composition of toUpper and toWords using this new template:\nWriter&gt; process(string s) {\n   return compose&gt;(toUpper, toWords)(s);\n}\nThere is still a lot of noise with the passing of types to t…",
