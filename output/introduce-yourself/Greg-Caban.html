Hello Everyone,<br/>My name is Greg and I’m a software engineer at Adzerk, where I get to code in Clojure, doing backend development and data engineering. Big fan of Lisp, Functional Programming and PL topics in general, with a keen interest in how FOC ideas can make data exploration and analysis easier and more accessible for everyone, including non programmers.<br/>Few years ago I had a chance to work on Mathematica inspired custom language with Notebook based UI and backed by Hadoop Data Lake, built as a data exploration platform for a financial institution and it was quite an eye opening experience.<br/>I’m very excited to discover that there is a community of people sharing the dissatisfaction with current state of programming and dedicated to exploring ideas on how to improve its future!
