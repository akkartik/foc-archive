&gt; Which mental faculties are involved in programming? If we knew more about them, could we invent programming languages that were both easier to use and more powerful?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; This is not a well-studied area, and very few aspects of programming languages, old or new, are evaluated formally for the quality of their "human factors" or "user experience". For example, among the features of artificial languages, there has been no attempt to separate experimentally those features that are cultural artifacts, from those that reflect our innate, genetically-endowed mental capacities.<br/>From <a href="https://chomskyalexander.blogspot.com/2010/03/depth-and-innate-judgements.html?m=1">https://chomskyalexander.blogspot.com/2010/03/depth-and-inna&hellip;</a><br/><br/>Has anyone come across other programming languages with a similar idea?

<a href="http://web.cs.unlv.edu/stefika/">Dr. Andreas Stefik</a>'s research is on "evidence based" programming. Designed to create syntax based on scientific studies of how people program.<br/><br/>The <a href="https://quorumlanguage.com/evidence.html">Quorum</a> language is the result of his efforts.<br/><br/>Dr. Stefik gave a good talk at Strange Loop about this a few years ago:<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFrE6cgVNY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFrE6cgVNY</a>

The literature* seems to indicate that the strongest correlation between in-born attribute and high levels of programming ability is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory">working memory</a>. This might suggest that reducing the need for working memory would be one of the best ways to make programming easier for those not "born to it."<br/><br/>(* <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06305.pdf">This paper</a> and its references would be a good place to start if you're interested in this sort of thing.)

Thanks for the links <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ray Imber</span> &amp; <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jack Rusher</span>!<br/>Thinking about working memory, there're also studies that:<br/>&gt; ... several such chunks could then be combined into a higher-order chunk, forming a hierarchy of chunks. In this way, only some chunks at the highest level of the hierarchy must be retained in working memory, and for retrieval the chunks are unpacked. That is, the chunks in working memory act as retrieval cues that point to the digits they contain<br/>I wonder if different constructs/programming paradigms could make it easier or harder to form chunks :thinking_face: .

That quote reminds me of the memory palace / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">method of loci technique</a> used in speed memorization contests. :nerd_face:<br/>Ryan Singer also talks about this <a href="https://synthetic.transistor.fm/episodes/design-as-a-multi-scale-network-thin-vs-fat-tailed-problems">idea of Multi-scale networks</a> to solve problems (though in a slightly different context)<br/><br/>I think we already do something like this in programming today:<br/>A <tt>for loop</tt> is an abstraction for a set of assembly code with an increment operation, a comparison operation, and a jump operation.<br/>A function or method is an abstraction for a set of logically related instructions.<br/>A module or API is a an abstraction that represents a set of related functions.<br/>edit: Additionally, a DSL or a <tt>macro</tt> is somewhere between a function and an API. I haven't decided which yet. :stuck_out_tongue:

The programming benefits of chunking up to higher levels of abstraction (and having an easier time thinking with and remembering things for which we have a good shorthand) is a fairly Sapir-Whorf observation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity</a>
