If the community gets some more funding, there's a bunch of initiatives I'd love to funnel it toward.\n\nFor one, throwing Mariano a few bones for the newsletter and tools he's building. For two, some scratch for the folks working on a community zettel. For three, I'd love to get some regular video chat based events going, and someone could organize those. For four, I'd _love_ to pay someone from an underrepresented background who is already working on something like this.. to do a bit of an anthropology of similarly underrepresented folks in the history of HCI \/ PL \/ hardware \/ etc. — there are some amazing projects buried in the past, that I'm aware of only in passing, that would blow minds if they were distilled into an accessible form (something like Steve's <https:\/\/futureofcoding.org\/catalog\/|Catalog>).\n\n&gt; In the meantime it seems like utilising network effects to spread the cause is one of the best uses of effort. [...]\nTo the extent that it's sort of happening automatically, totally agree. I like that the community has a good reputation for the subject matter, and I want to keep it that way. (The community does, or at least did, have a reputation for being male-dominated and \"bro-y\", which I am doing what I can to fix. I think this will mostly take hygiene — kicking out anyone toxic — and time, but I also think this is a good place to spend some of our community-initiative energy.)\n\nWhile I do like seeing the community grow, the main thing I'm interested in is keeping it sticky. We've had 1200 people pass through the door (going by the member count on <#C5T9GPWFL|thinking-together>), but there are only about 300 who are still here, actively participating or lurking. That's a fine ratio, IMHO, but I'd love to see it get better and not get worse.",

These descriptions are written off-the-cuff for the audience here, who I expect to be familiar with the community as it exists now and with that big <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/CEXED56UR\/p1595571837137000|previous discussion>. I intend to write up something like this <https:\/\/stltech.org\/|Member Handbook> for a newcomer audience, with more clear and concise descriptions.\n\nThe first three channels (alphabetically) are about the community itself.\n\n*#admin* — discussion about the administration of the community, meta-discussion about the Slack, requests for moderation, discussion of community finances and governance, etc. Formerly called <#CEXED56UR|administrivia>.\n*#announcements —* super low-volume channel with messages that every community member should see, even if they only log-in infrequently.\n*#introduce-yourself* — the first post by every new community member should go here. Formerly called <#CC2JRGVLK|introduce-yourself>.\n\nThe next channel is by itself.\n\n*#linking-together* — If you want to start a discussion about an article, talk, book, paper, or other work authored external to the community, this is the channel. We devote a channel to these \"external\" discussions so that it's easier to follow the \"internal\" discussions that happen in other channels. This does create a decision that some might struggle with (\"Which channel does _this_ go in? I understand all the guidelines, but this falls in a grey area and I'm not sure!\"), but I don't believe that's a problem that is entirely solvable at the level of channel design. The previously linked Member Handbook should carry significant weight here. Another point about this channel is that I'm not entirely happy with the name, and would love something that _even better-_satisfies all the design goals _and_ starts with the letter \"R\". Suggestions welcome.\n\nThe following are what I've previously called \"subject-specific channels\". They're all named with a common scheme, so that they (A) sort together and (B) reinforce that we're here primarily to talk about the _future_ _*of*_ these subjects, not just to gossip about current goings-on. This common scheme should make it much less painful for us to add new subject-specific channels as the interest arises, or to rename existing ones, since these channels are all off _over there_ in their own space.\n\n*#of-end-user-programming*\n*#of-functional-programming*\n*#of-graphics*\n*#of-music*\n*#of-research*\n\nAll the following channels are one-offs, and aren't meant to form a group.\n\n*#present-of-programming* — Our community contains considerable expertise about programming as it's currently practiced. It would be valuable for us to have a space where we could share that expertise, without dragging the community away from its main focus on futurism, research, and experimental development. A channel focussed on the present also gives us a way to more clearly define what subjects or projects qualify as meaningfully \"futuristic\", without entirely excluding other subjects from being welcome in the community — the lack of such an outlet has made me very reluctant to broach this topic. One other point about this channel is that, again, I'm not entirely happy with the name, and suggestions that balance the design goals are welcome, though it can't start with the same letter as any existing channels, or any letter lower than \"I\".\n\n*#share-your-work* — This channel is for nurturing feedback, fostering collaboration, gathering input, links to external things by community members. It has overlap with other channels (like #linking-together, the subject-specific channels) but the key factor is that _everything_ in this channel is by someone in this community, and they want you to approach it on terms they define. There's no harm in someone posting their own work to another channel. There's no harm in posting things that aren't totally futuristic in their scope. This is the channel that newcomers should enjoy browsing, as a way of seeing all the cool things made by people here in this community, and how helpful we are with our feedback.\n\n*#thinking-together* — This is the most important channel. It's the new <#C5T9GPWFL|thinking-together>, minus the links to external stuff covered by #linking-together. This channel is for questions, ideas, brainstorming, wild visions, summaries of research. Things in here must be forward looking (though this can include scouring history for things we can apply to the future). This is the channel for people actually building the future of computing. Links in posts are welcome (eg: supporting references), but the discussions should not be centred on some external media that needs to be read\/watched\/etc and then reflected on.\n\n*<#C0120A3L30R|two-minute-week>* — Closing out the channel list, this channel is exactly what it is now. It's a fun collaborative experiment in sharing our work, with accessibility prized above depth.\n\nIf you are happy with this plan, enough at least to try it out for a while, please leave a positive emoji reaction on this post. (I'll be interpreting the sentiment of the emojis, so feel free to hit me with your best contrarianism.) If you have significant concerns about this plan, please leave a comment in the replies to this post.\n\nThank you all for weighing in with your thoughts and ideas so far! I hope these changes (and other upcoming initiatives, like some sort of Member Handbook) will fix a few issues we've had and, as the startups say, _unlock deeper collaboration across the organization._ &lt;3",
