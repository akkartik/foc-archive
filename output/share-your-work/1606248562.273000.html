Just published a new essay y’all might find interesting, on why code is an important medium for communication (no new ideas for this forum, of course :slightly_smiling_face: ) in many cases we get access to more precision than mathematical notation offers. but much more powerfully, code can power many different representations of some idea:<br/><br/>1. the symbols of the themselves<br/>2. mathematical notation generated from the symbols<br/>3. animations<br/>4. graphical renderings <br/>alternate title might have been “Code as a better serialization format for scientific ideas”.

I agree with most of what you say, but keep wondering of what exactly you mean by "code". Most often that term is used for algorithms and data structures expressed in a programming language. However, many scientific ideas are not of that kind. The most powerful scientific models we have are expressed as specifications, not algorithms, and programming languages are not a good medium to express them.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Shalabh</span> just shared a paper by Terry Winograd on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/chatur_shalabh/status/1331410504204488706">https://twitter.com/chatur_shalabh/status/1331410504204488706</a>) that addresses this point very well (and is 40 years old!). It describes "Three domains of descriptions" of software systems. Scientific concepts, models, and ideas belong to the "subject domain", whereas code is designed for the "domain of implementation".<br/><br/>However, if you define "code" in a wider sense that includes formal languages designed for other purposes than "programming", then I agree with everything you say :wink:

I’m going to start sharing these physics-as-code essays that can’t animate themselves yet, so in part I was trying to prepare folks for the knee-jerk “wait, how is all this code he’s sending us any better than reading the original math?”

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Lucian Ursu</span> A simple example to illustrate the difference is sorting. The specification of sorting is<br/> 1. L' = sorted(L) is a list with the same elements as the list L<br/> 2. The elements x_i of L' satisfy x_i &lt;= x_{i+1}.<br/>There are many algorithms satisfying this specification (quick sort, heap sort, etc.). The information content of specification and implementation is very different, as neither one is trivially derived from the other. It requires non-trivial creative work to find an algorithm satisfying a specification, and it also requires a serious effort for someone else than the author to prove that a given algorithm actually satisfies the specification, although that direction is in general simpler.<br/><br/>In mathematics, we have exactly the same relation between equations and their solutions, so we can say that equations are specifications for their solutions. They provide a criterion to check if a solution is correct, but no help at all for actually finding a solution, which therefore requires non-trivial creative work.

If you look at the history of science, the most powerful scientific models are specifications (e.g. the equations named after Newton, Maxwell, Schrödinger, Einstein, etc.). More importantly, most scientific insight has been derived from the equations rather than from their solutions (which however are very important to check that the model actually describes reality). Example: you can derive energy conservation from Newton's equations, but not from any one of its many solutions.

Yes. Note though that finding solutions involves more than just computation. It's not something we can automate yet. Nor have we figured out automatic methods for finding specifications from solutions. Which is why Wired's proclamation of the "end of theory" (<a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/06/pb-theory/">https://www.wired.com/2008/06/pb-theory/</a>) is very premature.

Well, that's so high-level a description that it's probably universal. The main effort is developing scientific models is identifying the most useful entities.
