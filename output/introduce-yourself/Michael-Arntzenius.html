Hi! I'm Michael Arntzenius, I go by "rntz" online. I used to think I would reinvent programming all by my lonesome. Then I realized it might be a tad more difficult than I thought, so I scaled back. Nowadays I'm mostly chugging away in academia at little problems that I can make headway on, like: how do we combine functional and relational/set-oriented programming nicely? (For that, see <a href="http://www.rntz.net/datafun/">http://www.rntz.net/datafun/</a>) But I'm still interested in the bigger picture. Themes I keep coming back to are:<br/><br/>1. Small programs. Ideas last longer than code. So make your code small enough it becomes an idea.<br/><br/>2. Monotonicity: systems that always go in "one direction", eg. append-only databases, CRDTs, LVars, propagators, recursion in Datalog...<br/><br/>3. Incrementality. I think a lot of code is incidentally complex because it's trying to handle <em>change</em> efficiently. How can we make this easy?<br/><br/>4. Unexpected uses of simple type systems. Eg. To enforce monotonicity; or, as dynamic contracts rather than static guarantees; or, as data for metaprogramming with.<br/><br/>5. Communication. Maybe the future is in lots of special-purpose tools/langs, not one tool to rule them all. But for that to work, we need tools that work together well. Unix byte-streams were a useful first step in this direction, but are too limiting.<br/><br/>I joined this Slack after seeing on Twitter that there had been a meetup in London. I live in Oxford, so maybe I can come down the next time a meetup happens.<br/><br/>Also, hello <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Thomas Ballinger</span>!
