welcome to the group. There is no question that better languages can drastically simplify programming, and that a much larger number of personality types can enjoy programming once this grand simplification occurs. I find at present, programming is restricted to people who could do a 5000 piece jigsaw puzzle. That takes a very special kind of persistence, patience, and strong pattern recognition skills. Most puzzles sold are in the 300 / 500 / 1000 piece sizes, and many stores don't even stock a 5000 piece jigsaw.

&gt; There is no question that better languages can drastically simplify programming..<br/><br/>I question it, actually.<br/><br/>1. I don't think programming can be simplified. There's a kernel of irreducible essential complexity here. What we <em>can</em> do is unpack the complexity and stage it, so that newcomers don't have too steep a wall to climb. Carve steps into the sides of the wall.<br/><br/>2. I don't think the solution is better languages. The solution is better environments. We've recently discussed this here.<br/><br/>Totally fine that we disagree about these things! I just object to the "no question".
