If the set of states is partitioned you could say you have two state machines running independently. If there's overlap the state machine metaphor is a net liability for understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, I think attaching attributes like a duration is fine? And an animation by itself is fine; clock ticks feel like fine events to base state transitions on.\n\nGoing back a bit:\n&gt; The charts seem straightforward enough. And nested state machines are a thing.\nI've been seeing these state chart pictures all my life, and I've even tried reading the papers a few times. But I totally miss (or quickly forget) one key property. In a state chart enclosure is backstopping. If a state encounters an event it can't handle, it passes it up to the enclosing state.\n\nIt seems obvious now that I write it out like that. And it's isomorphic with my previous understanding: that hierarchies are a way to extract common transitions and simplify the state diagram. But it still felt surprising. I think I have some theoretical knowledge but zero \"fingertip feel\" for state charts based on personal experience. Which makes all my opinions on it suspect..",
