Here's what I think the primary proposal is, from deep inside section 6, 80% of the way down.\n\nThe basic recommendation:\n\n&gt; ...all design elements be exposed in a structured space of publicly addressible names...\n\nIn more detail:\n\n&gt;  We propose an aggressive program to assimilate the functions of traditional programming languages and their component systems, by stratifying them vertically into two parts:\n&gt;\n&gt;  * On top, an integration domain which encodes not only relations between runtime values, but also the structure of any adaptations expressed in the “virtual class” idiom seen in section 4.3, using the selector structure described in section 6.1.1 to predicate the addresses of these relations and the targets of these adaptations. In order to retain the symmetry implied by our “algebra of differences”, all component structure is expressed within the integration domain, that is, it encodes all classes as well as virtual classes.\n&gt;\n&gt;  * Below the integration domain, then, remains a highly impoverished language dialect that just consists of free functions which express any remnant computation that could not be effectively expressed in the integration domain. The free functions in the impoverished language are addressible through stable names in their own global namespace, and each of them obeys the Law of Demeter strongly, in that they are pure functions of their immediate arguments.\n&gt;\n&gt; ...assimilating the power of reference to the addresses of state into an integration domain which is incapable of computation...\n\n[1] Promoted from <https:\/\/futureprogramming.slack.com\/archives\/C5T9GPWFL\/p1543845454059000?thread_ts=1543729043.042700&amp;cid=C5T9GPWFL>",

In order to retain the symmetry implied by our “algebra of differences”, all component structure is expressed within the integration domain, that is, it encodes all classes as well as virtual classes.\n\n * Below the integration domain, then, remains a highly impoverished language dialect that just consists of free functions which express any remnant computation that could not be effectively expressed in the integration domain. The free functions in the impoverished language are addressible through stable names in their own global namespace, and each of them obeys the Law of Demeter strongly, in that they are pure functions of their immediate arguments.\n\n...assimilating the power of reference to the addresses of state into an integration domain which is incapable of computation..."
