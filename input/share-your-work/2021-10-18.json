        "text": "Hello FoC Community,\n\nI am part of a team -- including <@U02JDAYKW7J> -- that has long been thinking about issues of personal computing, malleability, programming, and authorship. Last year we had funding for a lab and worked on a <https:\/\/github.com\/dkrasner\/Simpletalk)|web-based authoring system we call Simpletalk> (you can see <https:\/\/simpletalk.systems\/|a live version of it here>). I recently gave <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5U6MkU5fLJw|a talk at Strange Loop> about the wider vision and motivations for this work, as well as a short demo of the system. You can read more detail about our motivation in <https:\/\/github.com\/dkrasner\/Simpletalk\/blob\/master\/ComputingManifesto.pdf|this document>.\n\nWe would like to propose two things to the community here. The first would be a live talk \/ demo session, and we would like to gauge your interest in attending. Second, we will soon have test accounts for people to make their own Simpletalk stacks and worlds. If you are interested in participating, feel free to DM either of us and we will let you know when it is ready.\n\nAny feedback and\/or discussion is always welcome.\n\nPS - Simpletalk is not a \"product\" and is still experimental. Use the latest versions of Firefox for the best experience.\n\nThanks!",

The first would be a live talk \/ demo session, and we would like to gauge your interest in attending. Second, we will soon have test accounts for people to make their own Simpletalk stacks and worlds. If you are interested in participating, feel free to DM either of us and we will let you know when it is ready.\n\nAny feedback and\/or discussion is always welcome.\n\nPS - Simpletalk is not a \"product\" and is still experimental. Use the latest versions of Firefox for the best experience.\n\nThanks!"
