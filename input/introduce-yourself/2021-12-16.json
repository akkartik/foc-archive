Telepathy is the ideal.\nI'm not a coder, so I was pleasantly surprised that what scientists have largely neglected is a hot topic (of sorts) in the world of software engineering. I hope to learn from you all and share ideas from an angle on visual thinking and communication you may not have encountered before.",
