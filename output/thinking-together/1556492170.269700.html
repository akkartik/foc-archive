That's an argument for why "visual languages" shouldn't be thrown in the trash heap but not for why they should be pursued. To shed light on the latter proposition: I teach people how to code for a living, and one solid truth that reveals itself is that keyword-and-symbol-based representations of language constructs are hard to understand. We may not realise with our survivorship bias just how unintuitive a bunch of keywords are, but a language's syntax is fundamentally a representation of its semantics, and learning a language is about being able to recognise, comprehend, and interact with that semantics. Keywords and ASCII symbols obscure language semantics to an extreme degree. This is not merely an assertion - it is extraordinarily apparent from watching people learn how to code. The only question is: how can we do better?
