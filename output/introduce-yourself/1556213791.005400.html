Happy to be here. I'm an Oracle database developer and have been sort of stuck in this niche for about 20 years. I do web development with Oracles newly rebranded low code tool called Application Express (Apex for short but not to be confused with Salesforce).<br/><br/>I find I keep coming back to ideas around better languages, better tools, and developer experience and somehow found this group last night. For me it seems like we are swimming in place and I guess I feel like I'm smart enough to want to find a way out of this mouse maze and into a better one.

I think most of us here feel similarly. This is a good place to exchange ideas, feedback, and resources. Most of us have found inspiration by Alan Kay and/or Bret Victor, which is a great place to start if you are interested in the idea of getting out of the programming tar-pit you describe. Find Alan Kay on YouTube (e.g. "computer revolution hasn't happened yet" or "programming and scaling"), and Bret Victor at <a href="http://worrydream.com">worrydream.com</a>. There's also since good write-ups at <a href="http://vpri.org">vpri.org</a>.<br/><br/>Also, checkout the Future of Coding podcasts

Thanks Dan. Pursuing all of the above. At work right now I am looking to convert lots of literal values and conditionals into decision tables and hoping to find a way to make them executable. I have found inspiration in this DSL KernelF which is like a way to embed functional expressions into another language leading to code that can read like a spreadsheet.<br/>“The Philosophy behind Language Engineering with MPS” by Markus Voelter <a href="https://link.medium.com/kqhDnHlPhW">https://link.medium.com/kqhDnHlPhW</a>

My POV may be slightly different in that I deal with data and workflow systems where the logic needs to be owned by SMEs but the way we code things doesn't do much to create a shared vocabulary where SMEs even feel like logic is their domain. So I am trying to get decision tables out there as a way to communicate.
