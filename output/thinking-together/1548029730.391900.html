&gt; At authoring time, it's limiting that my team has to contribute to your project in Python because your part is in Python<br/>But on the contrary, letting everyone choose their own language has to be a nightmare for maintainability, e.g. when the person who wrote a chunk of code in their own language and style leaves the project.<br/>&gt; At run-time, it's limiting that when your piece crashes mine goes down with it<br/>Does RPC solve this better than projects with a single code base and a good type system? RPC is synchronous, so a failed call will cause an error value to be returned either way.
