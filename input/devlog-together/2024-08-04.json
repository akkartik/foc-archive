When any of these values are changed, they propagate forward through the network.\nIn the current example flow, an error is also calculated using an expression node-type depending on the output and expected value.\nThe white object-node is also a new node-type and can be used to obtain multiple values and output them in a single object.\n\nIn the near future I hope to implement a neural network that can be trained with the mnist digit dataset, but I have to do a lot more work before I am at that stage I think.",

Fluid layout, one breakpoint that moves elements around for smaller screens, light and dark modes, nice keyboard nav, etc etc. Thoroughly documented too, since I figure some folks might want to peek at the css but aren't up on all the new weird stuff you can do.\n\nAlso, I'll be eating my hat now: everyone who scolded me for attempting to parse a markdown-like syntax with Regex, well, yeah, it kinda stinks. Not sure what to do about this, given the values I'd like to impart in this project. Since it's not a blocker on writing pages, I think I'll ship it half-finished and we can talk about it. This feels like a great area to draw on the wisdom of the crowd.\n\nMarkdown or not, we'll still need a build script, I reckon, unless we want to _require_ that anyone adding a new page also add their page to any relevant indexes â€” since, I reckon, we'll need some indexes just to get through the early phase where the wiki will be sparsely interconnected. To start, I'm thinking one index of broad categories (or maybe tags, dunno), and then another that's just a list of all pages. But if anyone has strong feelings about the right way to do this, I'm at least 75% ears.",
