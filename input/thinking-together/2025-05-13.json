        "text": "<@U71PMQ1V0> Biologists have thought about questions like the optimal amount of death. I have only vague memories of seeing work on this. But I am pretty sure that the answer is contextual. There is no universally optimal amount of death, but one for each species in a specific ecosystem. Moreover, there is probably not one optimal value, but a wide range of good values, with soft lower and upper bounds.\nThe more interesting question for me is why there needs to be death at all. The answer is adaptability to changing environmental conditions. Which explains why the best amount of death depends on the rate of change in the environment.\n\nMy reading of <@U03R0B9U1GD>'s \"let code die\" is \"don't focus on the code, focus on the role of the code in its socio-technical environment\".

But I am pretty sure that the answer is contextual. There is no universally optimal amount of death, but one for each species in a specific ecosystem. Moreover, there is probably not one optimal value, but a wide range of good values, with soft lower and upper bounds.\nThe more interesting question for me is why there needs to be death at all. The answer is adaptability to changing environmental conditions. Which explains why the best amount of death depends on the rate of change in the environment.\n\nMy reading of "
