I'd take two computer programs and the program mixer would spit out a new piece of software. It was a great feeling to think about all the possibilities that (imaginary) program mixer would give me. Later, I had some fun with Cycle.js and even wrote an own prototypical FRP framework with some different accents. I also contributed a little to Athens Research, which is still my personal knowledge base. Unfortunately, I have a hard time getting my long-term ideas to paper -- I definitely have to work on it.\n\nToday, the more I think about programming, the more I feel that it's about organizing knowledge. A nice code base is like a well-written book. In both cases, a lot of refactoring, \"debugging\" and striving for consistency and clarity is required. (And source code is just one of many knowledge fragments in a project...) Sometimes, when our underlying theories change, we have to \"reframe\" an entire code or knowledge base. Maybe similar tools can help in both situations. Might there be a single tool for programming and knowledge organization?\n\nRight now, I am reading some climate science to build an explorable explanation of the underlying history and epistemology for beginners. The heart of the explanation will be a series of simulations of various basic climate models (e.g. earth=blackbody, no regional variations etc.), all of them being simple enough to run in a web browser. The most complex model will take into account water vapor and the user will be able to fiddle with the parameters. I have a twofold interest in this project: I have a passion learning and explaining things. On the other hand, I'm struggling myself with basing my epistemology on solid ground and expect to learn a lot from how climate scientists (or other scientists) bootstrapped their epistemology. If someone's interested in working together, just text me! :)",
