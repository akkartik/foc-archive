For me they feel very _much_ related to the future of coding. \n\nLike this one:\n<https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=41136056|https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=41136056>\n\nIn this respect, their page for hacking baguettes by sun&sea is my personal favourite\n<https:\/\/100r.co\/site\/solar_cooking_experiment.html|https:\/\/100r.co\/site\/solar_cooking_experiment.html>\n100Rabbits is like the coming true of Grothendieck's 1972 permatech lecture given at CERN*\n<https:\/\/github.com\/Lapin0t\/grothendieck-cern|https:\/\/github.com\/Lapin0t\/grothendieck-cern>\n>\"I think that agriculture, stockbreeding, decentralized energy production, medicine of a certain kind, very different from the medicine that prevails today, will come to the fore. It's impossible to say which part purely creative joy will play in these new developments. My hope is, it will be a creative development in which there will be no essential difference between conceptual activities and manual physical activities. When people become masters of their own needs to the point where an appreciable part of their creativity remains free---and this will take a time we can't predict, it may be a generation, it may be ten, no one knows---at that point, anyone, not just a certain scientific elite, will be able to devote a significant part of their time to purely creative, purely speculative, purely playful research\"",

                "text": "In computability theory, Rice's theorem states that all non-trivial semantic properties of programs are undecidable. A semantic property is one about the program's behavior (for instance, \"does the program terminate for all inputs?\"), unlike a syntactic property (for instance, \"does the program contain an if-then-else statement?\"). A non-trivial property is one which is neither true for every program, nor false for every program.\nThe theorem generalizes the undecidability of the halting problem. It has far-reaching implications on the feasibility of static analysis of programs. It implies that it is impossible, for example, to implement a tool that checks whether a given program is correct, or even executes without error.\nThe theorem is named after Henry Gordon Rice, who proved it in his doctoral dissertation of 1951 at Syracuse University.",
