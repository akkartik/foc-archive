Hey everyone, I'm Daniel. I write code for a living, and consider my life's mission to leave the place better than I found it.<br/><br/>I have no memory of how I found Future of Coding, but I think possibly while desperately searching for coding-related podcasts with deep content. While the actual F of C isn't something I'm extremely interested in <em>per se</em>, I have an intellectual/philosophical streak that makes observing these kinds of discussions really enjoyable. I first listened to the Naur episode and found it incredible, and quite illuminating of the <em>Present</em> of Coding.<br/><br/>I was born in Australia and have lived in a few other places around the world, but currently based in Sydney. I consider myself a Quaker with significant Christian influence. My influences at the moment are Jacques Ellul, Christopher Alexander, Ursulas Franklin and Le Guin, Karl Popper via David Deutsch, and Sandi Metz.<br/><br/>Looking forward to lurking and hopefully, when so moved, providing small contributions of some value :)
