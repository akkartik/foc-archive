Heyo! I run a video game studio, where I develop most of our internal tooling and do all of the webdev. I'm super interested in making tools self-service, expressive, and accessible. I'm a huge fan of Typescript, and try to solve every problem with web tech if I can get away with it.<br/><br/>I'm a self taught programmer with a PhD in Cell &amp; Molecular Biology (barely used -- went right into games after grad school). I can't remember how I found FoC, but the sheer depth of nerdery in the podcast got me hooked. I'm only a few episodes in, but thought I'd hop in here to see what the community is like.
