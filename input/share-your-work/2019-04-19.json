I think there is a leap here: \"if you are trying to write a new programming tool or language or system, then I think you'll find yourself working with syntax trees and grammars\". Yes if you go down this path certainly Knuth etc. are useful. But how do you choose which path you want to explore or what different paths are even available? Are there other paths where you have programmable systems *without* complex parsing? What could these look like? For the broader problem I think we could take a holistic outlook where computation machines, cognitive psychology, HCI all blur together.",

I think there is a leap here: \"if you are trying to write a new programming tool or language or system, then I think you'll find yourself working with syntax trees and grammars\". Yes if you go down this path certainly Knuth etc. are useful. But how do you choose which path you want to explore or what different paths are even available? Are there other paths where you have programmable systems "
