        "text": "I can imagine an ethnography covering the effect of tech influencers on the proliferation of devtools:\n\nLet's say someone does a tech podcast. They need to come up with a fresh topic every week. It's easier to cover a library or framework than to cover, say, the value of using plain data structures 99.9% of the time, and how to identify the 0.1%. It's easy to talk _news_, very hard to dredge up wisdom week after week. And if you cover the new hotness, you get to participate in hype waves, which are great for audience growth. This in turn encourages devs to make more of the sorts of devtools that get coverage. A race to the bottom ensues, where devs trade on empty promise, and audiences are never exposed to true exemplars of craft.\n\nI should try to dig up this episode of… some JS podcast I listened to a decade back. They had some devs on to talk about their new library. It was blowing up on twitter. The devs had, thus far, only put together a static landing page and a logo. No code, no demos, barely any description of goals. It was pure vacuous hype. And on the podcast, they were already hyping _the next_ thing.",
