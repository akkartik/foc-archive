        "text": "Hi Ivan, thanks for the message! Big fan of your work. Yes, Rhino is a NURBS program - in fact their geometry engine OpenNURBS is open source. (https:\/\/github.com\/mcneel\/opennurbs with documentation on the McNeel site) I haven't played with it, but I know some companies outside McNeel base their software on it too. Anyway...\nGrasshopper is indeed really amazing. Its introduction led to a HUGE democratization of computational design in architecture. I mean - a really, really big shift. Most people treat it as just an engine for creating more and crazier geometries, but I approach it as a language and that's extremely rewarding.\n\nYou're correct that a lot of people do jewelry with Rhino because it's NURBS based and they can do the nice flowing surfaces that look good in jewelry. (It's also big in transport design because of this) For Katherine and I it was mostly that we picked jewelry as a good domain in which to use the tools. That is - I was deep into Grasshopper and getting going with home 3d printing which was still a rare thing at this point a decade ago. I was finding that to do computational design and advanced fabrication at architectural scale you either had to work for a big firm and got some small discrete chunk of the project - a reception desk or something - or you were on your own and nothing ever actually got built because the costs were too high for your typical client who turns to a small office.\n\nKatherine's background is in fashion and costume design. And she's always been working toward having her own company. So between my Rhino \/ Grasshopper and obsession with geometry and her knowledge of the human body as a landscape and digital sculpting skills we decided jewelry was a good outlet. Which it's been.\n\nI'd love to continue chatting about it too - as you can tell I have a lot to say (lol). It's great to be here, great to meet you all, and thanks for the warm welcome!!!",
