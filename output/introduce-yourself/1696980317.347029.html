A friend told me about this group recently, and I realize I should have joined long ago! I'll introduce myself - I'm Mike from the Bay Area, California, and I love design and love to code (day job is UX Eng). My bumper sticker would say "I'd rather be coding". If I didn't code, I would likely would have become an industrial designer. A "little" project I've been working on is a React (as in UI framework) Desktop and programming language. Only recently have I tied the Desktop and the language together, which in hindsight I also should have done a long time ago :slightly_smiling_face: <a href="https://mike-austin.com/react-desktop">https://mike-austin.com/react-desktop</a><br/><br/>In "Files", if you go into Scripts, you can run a few demos like Particle System.kopi or read some of the Kopi Markdown files. Both the desktop and language have been through several versions over several years, and are designed by "what should I do next / what feels missing?" mentality. Enjoy!
