Fast enough I it didn't interrupt my flow typing this comment. In many UI environments that ends up being 4x to 16x the work.

Each row is an object, each column is a property. If one object hasn't have that property it's cell is marked in some way.\n\nIt's in this way you can quickly compare a bunch of properties across object as well as edit them.\n\nI say that's not useful because I think, though I'm not really a Maya user, that not that many Maya users use that feature. I guess I'd have to go ask.\n\nI mostly just bring it up as one example of a way to help power users with UIs that end up getting in their way more than helping.",
