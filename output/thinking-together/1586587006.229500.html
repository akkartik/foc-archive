Has anyone thought about the practicality of a (general-purpose) language without floating-point numbers? I've always been skeptical of floats, but in the language I'm designing in particular, computations don't have a total ordering, and so the most natural way to sum/multiply numbers is a SUM() or PRODUCT() function that accepts an unordered set (rather than looping through an ordered list). You can't use these functions for floats, because neither summation nor multiplication of floats is associative. I want my language to use BigInts (arbitrary precision) anyway, so I think I should just go ahead and have <b>rational numbers</b> (fractions) as the built-in type for fractional numbers. This would present some new design challenges, such as defining some ergonomic "round-off" functions that can be used alongside multiplication (and sin/cos/sqrt etc) to prevent unbounded growth of numerator and denominator sizes.
