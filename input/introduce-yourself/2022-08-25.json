They like to learn about kubernetes and the intricacies of AWS APIs. Those things bore me. I want to explore ideas by building.\n\nI'm not sure what draws me to this community. I've listened to the podcast. And I'm intrigued by the many projects I see in this Slack. I have many incomplete projects, but nothing worth showing to others. Sometimes UI intrigues me (I love the intricacies of getting the interactivity just right). But again, very few things to show. I fear I wouldn't be able to do it professionally.
