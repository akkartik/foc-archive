I'm usually a fan of his writing, but this reads like Salvatore had a frustrating week at work and is taking it out on the internet. He clearly feels like his particular <em>programming aesthetic</em> is under attack. I'm not as convinced - for every one of those points I can think of counter-examples. Moreover, I can think of cases where "we" are doing what he's asking for - it's all a straw-man!

I think this is what is happening in large corporate settings as opposed to globally/in the world. There is a ton of cruft and tech debt in enterprise software, as well as in some of the ways cs is taught. I can see how this is true within some contexts. It depends on who “we” are.

Good points. I think it's indeed his personal vision on how software should be.<br/><br/>The thing is, I completely agree with his points.<br/><br/>Perhaps his point would have been stronger if he qualified it a bit more as how he feels about the whole thing.<br/><br/>I think this is more than just aesthetic. If I understand antirez, he <b>needs</b> that simplicity to be able to pull off what he does. It's not a nice to have, but the most central necessity.<br/><br/>I do feel exactly like him and I don't think simplicity is a matter of aesthetics for me either, it makes all the difference between thriving and floundering.
