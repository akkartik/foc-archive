The course appears to be focused on the needs of its students, and the students are probably better off taking it than not taking it.\n\nI suspect that Ivan's misgivings are related to the centralizing of text and a text-based interface.\n\nWithin text-based interfaces, however, Unix provides a particularly dynamic and flexible experience. \n\nAlthough the individual tools are mostly written in C, which is often viewed by dynamic language hackers as a language for building dead things which cannot be changed or restructured without killing the program and rebuilding it, the shell environment itself allows for easy experimentation and exploration.\n\nPipelines and filters are one of the most successful composibility and component reuse stories in history. \n\nMost filters are purely functional in the sense that they will produce the same output if given the same input. This makes them easier to reason about both individually and collectively.\n\nIt's easy to experiment with small one-liners, and when you finally get them right to save them into a shell script. The interface for doing things is the same as the interface for saving instructions to do those same things, which makes the transition from being a user to being a programmer gradual. There is no one place at which a Unix user must stop interacting with the system for a while and go spend a few weeks \"learning how to shell script\" before they can take the next step. You don't need to learn how to write a loop until you need a loop, for example.\n\nThe fact that data is mostly represented as plain text, and the user has a wide variety of extremely powerful tools available for manipulating plain text, that are infinitely composable and flexible, purely functional, and easy to reason about, in an environment that allows a user to easily save and reproduce a series of steps, gives the experienced user an incredible amount of power at his fingertips. \n\nAn advanced Unix user can sometimes perform in seconds data analysis tasks that would take the better part of an hour in a spreadsheet. Although these tasks could, in theory, be automated in a spreadsheet using VBA or some such, in practice they are typically written down in natural language and followed manually the next time they need to be reproduced. \n\nI'm not criticizing spreadsheets. They are also an incredible historical success. I'm praising the power of Unix for some types of tasks.\n\nI wonder why so many graphical programming environments (Scratch, Snap!, Blockly, etc.) create graphical representations of algorithmic structures, like if statements and for loops, but not data flow pipelines...\n\nI wonder what a graphical version of Unix shell scripting would look like.",

The course appears to be focused on the needs of its students, and the students are probably better off taking it than not taking it.\n\nI suspect that Ivan's misgivings are related to the centralizing of text and a text-based interface.\n\nWithin text-based interfaces, however, Unix provides a particularly dynamic and flexible experience. \n\nAlthough the individual tools are mostly written in C, which is often viewed by dynamic language hackers as a language for building dead things which cannot be changed or restructured without killing the program and rebuilding it, the shell environment itself allows for easy experimentation and exploration.\n\nPipelines and filters are one of the most successful composibility and component reuse stories in history. \n\nMost filters are purely functional in the sense that they will produce the same output if given the same input. This makes them easier to reason about both individually and collectively.\n\nIt's easy to experiment with small one-liners, and when you finally get them right to save them into a shell script. The interface for doing things is the same as the interface for saving instructions to do those same things, which makes the transition from being a user to being a programmer gradual. There is no one place at which a Unix user must stop interacting with the system for a while and go spend a few weeks \"learning how to shell script\" before they can take the next step. You don't need to learn how to write a loop until you need a loop, for example.\n\nThe fact that data is mostly represented as plain text, and the user has a wide variety of extremely powerful tools available for manipulating plain text, that are infinitely composable and flexible, purely functional, and easy to reason about, in an environment that allows a user to easily save and reproduce a series of steps, gives the experienced user an incredible amount of power at his fingertips. \n\nAn advanced Unix user can sometimes perform in seconds data analysis tasks that would take the better part of an hour in a spreadsheet. Although these tasks could, in theory, be automated in a spreadsheet using VBA or some such, in practice they are typically written down in natural language and followed manually the next time they need to be reproduced. \n\nI'm not criticizing spreadsheets. They are also an incredible historical success. I'm praising the power of Unix for some types of tasks.\n\nI wonder why so many graphical programming environments (Scratch, Snap!, Blockly, etc.) create graphical representations of algorithmic structures, like if statements and for loops, but not data flow pipelines...\n\nI wonder what a graphical version of Unix shell scripting would look like."

It's indeed a pain to use for inherently non-textual information, but we have nothing better for that case. So the short-term choice is text-based version control or no version control. And since version control is so important in many situations, and increasingly becomes mandatory, everyone focuses on text-based representations for everything. And even if later this year someone presents a version control mechanism for, say, pictures, it won't be used unless it integrates with git."
