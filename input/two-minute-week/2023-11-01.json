All it sees is, there's something in `Result`, and it draws it at a certain point on screen.\n• I don't show this in the video, but my hazy plan for larger computations is to add deeper subcomputations into new variables, say `Result_local1`, `Result_local2`, etc. And then define the \"visual protocol\" in `draw` to say where and how (bar graph, point coordinate, <http:\/\/etc.to|etc.) to> render each of them.\n• But now consider if I want to start rendering n points on screen. I might want the intermediate results in different locations depending on whether I'm computing one or a hundred.\nHmm, as I write this out I realize perhaps this isn't an issue with the globals. Any time I reorganize my computation I'm going to have to tweak my visual protocol. If a caller wants to juggle 10 invocations of `sum`, it's the caller's job to save the results to some other new global, with its own visual protocol.\n\nOk, I can live with this! It's a lot like having a database of globals in a web app. It's a minor transform to go from lots of little globals scattered everywhere to a single global table called \"intermediate results within subsystem foo\".",
