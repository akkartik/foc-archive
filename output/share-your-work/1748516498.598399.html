I made two demo extensions for <a href="https://gloodata.com/">gloodata</a> to showcase its capabilities and how to use it to create interactive data exploration tools enabled by LLMs, here they are:<br/><br/>- <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/population-and-demography">Our World in Data Demography &amp; Fertility</a> Explorer with DuckDB<br/>	- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA06oOxKh3w">Demo</a><br/>	- <a href="https://github.com/gloodata/extension-demography">Extension Repo</a><br/>- GitHub Repository Explorer with SQLite<br/>	- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV5E5gR5oKM">Demo</a><br/>	- <a href="https://github.com/gloodata/extension-github-repo-explorer/">Extension Repo</a>

cool videos.<br/>your sound levels need increasing.<br/>Not sure if going through the setup at the beginning is actually good for the content because I find it kinda off putting. When I view the github video I want to know "What useful facts will I extract from a Github repo?" first and foremost, i.e. the value prop. I had completely tuned out by the time I got to that content, especially as I had just watched the same thing in the other demo.<br/><br/>You probably think that explaining the setup is lowering friction but it doesn't seem that easy so I would hide that technical setup in a getting started guide and not in the demo vids.

The extension are meant as a demo of things that can be built, I'm not expecting anyone to download it to use those extensions, it's to attract people that want to build "something like that" but with their data. That's why it's more technical. When I do the reverse sometimes I get  questions like "so... you are building a tool to explore github repos?"
