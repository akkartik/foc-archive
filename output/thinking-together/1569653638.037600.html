My personal project is about blurring the lines between code, compiler, and running program; code and editor; programming and user interaction; programming language and regular old program abstractions; etc.<br/><br/>I've found it hard to explain what/why/how, but I just realized that I can demonstrate a lot of this by writing the same program several different ways:<br/><br/><li> I want to simulate a digital circuit, but (let's pretend) no good tool exists, so I write a program that does it all from scratch. The simulator and the specific circuit all live in the same program / code.<br/><li> Similar, but split the simulator into an external library that I use (but cannot modify) to build my circuit<br/><li> Write a "programming language" to specify the circuit, and an "interpreter" that runs the simulation<br/><li> Similar, but a compiler that generates the code (which in turn closely resembles the first approach)<br/><li> A structural code editor instead of passing textual code.<br/><li> A visual editor (e.g. editing a circuit diagram) instead of a programming language, but it's the same underlying structure as before, which still goes through an interpreter or compiler<br/><li> Similar, but the simulation is live as you edit - there's no compilation "pass"<br/><li> Similar, but also have the ability to generate code for it. (The analogy is having "code" be something live and perhaps non-textual; but "real code" is necessary in existing professional environments, you still build it -- but that doesn't mean that's what you have to "program" with)<br/><li> Compare the limitations / ease of "changing the rules" for each different approach (compare what's involved to make the same kind of change for each approach)<br/><br/>This will be easier to get up and running than my main project, and be a better demonstration / analogy for what I'm after (e.g. replacing "programming language" with something fluid that your code can change &amp; control, rather than being subject to it -- a whole new level of something being "written in itself")
