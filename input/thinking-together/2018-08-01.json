In fact I wish it was easy to do more configurations than a uni-directional pipeline.\n\n&gt; the amazingly pervasive files metaphor in Unix also enables designing for the future: because you cannot assume anything about a byte stream, you’re encouraged to build your filter or command line utility with the least amount of assumptions on what you will receive, thus avoiding the specific design for a specific data format which will immediately couple your program to a more specific aka limited use case and make many unanticipated use cases impossible.\n\nInteresting point. Quite likely there is something you are saying here that I am missing because I would say the opposite :slightly_smiling_face:. Here's my line of thought: dealing directly with byte streams makes you more coupled with the formats where any minor syntax change will break you. Two exceptions I can think of are `tee` (programs that treat the stream as opaque, just pass the bytes uninspected) and `wc` (programs that inspect well known 'standardized' byte markers). Any script that uses `grep` or `awk` is very closely bound to the syntax of the data. If the file format is changed (but semantically identical) all the scripts would have to be rewritten. Ideally it should be possible for the file itself to tell the script how to get the the same information from the new contents and the script should only have to be modified if the same information is not available. One way to do this is to shift the boundary between the tool and the file so the interaction is not 'give me your bytes' but instead 'give me your tokens\/records\/etc' - i.e. concepts at a higher level than 'bytes'. Hmm.. doing this makes it no longer a file, but an encapsulated object. Still early in the process of thinking along these lines.\n\nIt seems 'files with human readable formats' becomes important if 'give my your bytes' is the level of discourse we intend to have. In the encapsulated object scenario, each object has embedded within it an introspectable 'API' and perhaps visual inspector tailored to its purpose.",

Ideally it should be possible for the file itself to tell the script how to get the the same information from the new contents and the script should only have to be modified if the same information is not available. One way to do this is to shift the boundary between the tool and the file so the interaction is not 'give me your bytes' but instead 'give me your tokens\/records\/etc' - i.e. concepts at a higher level than 'bytes'. Hmm.. doing this makes it no longer a file, but an encapsulated object. Still early in the process of thinking along these lines.\n\nIt seems 'files with human readable formats' becomes important if 'give my your bytes' is the level of discourse we intend to have. In the encapsulated object scenario, each object has embedded within it an introspectable 'API' and perhaps visual inspector tailored to its purpose."

I jumped to objects because they seems to be the first shift that is qualitatively different. I think the difference comes from considering the boundary between the two entities as a *conversation*. Each entity is dependent on only the messages it sends and receives - it is free to reorganize its internals in any way. One implication is that each entity has an 'inside' and an 'outside' - encapsulation. So in theory you reduce the coupling itself to the bare essential by talking in messages with 'high level' meaning within the domain at hand. Only the meaning of the messages needs to be agreed upon. From this POV, reading an XML file is the conversation between 'tool' and 'file' that goes as follows:\n\n -&gt; read_bytes\n &lt;- here_you_go(bytes)\n\nWhile the meaning of those bytes is then extracted on the 'wrong' side of the boundary. The tool is still tightly coupled to the irrelevant details of mapping bytes to the higher constructs it really wants - say inventory data or user preferences or whatever. A better boundary actually does exists within the implementation of the tool itself - likely as a function or class boundary provided by an embedded parser. This makes it easy to 'change only the one part' of the tool when the format changes - but you still have to recompile and push out this tool everywhere, so where's the win?
