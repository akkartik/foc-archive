I’m writing a paper for the Human Aspects of Types and Reasoning Assistants workshop (<a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/home/hatra-2020#Call-for-Papers">https://2020.splashcon.org/home/hatra-2020#Call-for-Papers</a>) about what makes ownership in Rust challenging to use. For example, how incompleteness of static analysis makes it hard to interpret type errors as the fault of the user or the compiler. I’d love to get feedback on:<br/>• Does the process of interpreting a type error make sense? Does it ring true to your own experience (in Rust or other languages?)<br/>• Did you learn something new? Does this paper help you understand/frame the usability challenges about Rust specifically, or potentially a different language?

1. you should have line numbers printed next to the code if you’re going to reference code by line number—there’s some ambiguity in the motivating example as to whether “line 1” means <tt>let mut v =</tt> or <tt>let x =</tt>.<br/>2. i’m kind of a dumbass about rust, so more code comments would be helpful for people who (like me) haven’t bothered to learn the syntax (depends on your intended audience)<br/>3. it might be helpful to reference some of the literature on programming education specifically dealing with (i think they’re referred to as) cognitive schemas (sorry i can’t find the paper i’m thinking of atm)<br/>4. this seems like the type of thing language designers should absolutely be thinking about. i don’t know much about rust and haven’t learned about the borrow checker but this seems like a pretty solid intro

Aha's for me:<br/><li> the borrow checker is incomplete<br/><li> It conflates type parameters<br/><li> It conflates array indices (makes sense once I think about it)<br/><li> Your checklist of questions on existing an error message.<br/><li> The need for teaching ownership-based reasoning.<br/><li> How perverse the bag of tricks can be.<br/><li> How more complex analysis has the unanticipated drawback of reducing opportunities for learning.<br/><br/>Maybe we need multiple analysis engines that can be swapped out?

Here is a bit of context. I have a very small Rust experience. As small as reading half of "Programming Rust" from O'Reilly, start coding in Rust, trying to replicate other languages habits, struggle with lot's of compiler error messages, finally actually understand the hard way that habits must change, unperfectly change them, implement some basic toy CRDT algorithm in Rust (which target WebAssembly for use in the browser), forget about all of this (it was one year ago and I didn't use Rust again since).<br/><br/>For your first question:<br/>&gt; Does the process of interpreting a type error make sense? Does it ring true to your own experience (in Rust or other languages?)<br/>Yes, completely. And especially with Rust. Even if my memory of Rust is a bit... rusty (sorry for the bad pun...) and even if I didn't catch very well all your code examples (maybe I read it too fast too) reading the discussion totally makes sense and resonates with what I have experienced. To be precise on one point: I didn't write any unsafe code, even if there were several cases where it can be a solution. But as I was learning, and it strongly feels against the Rust idea, and that it seems complicated to write (and need to learn new things like you point in the article), I didn't do it.<br/><br/>And for the other question:<br/>&gt; Did you learn something new? Does this paper help you understand/frame the usability challenges about Rust specifically, or potentially a different language?<br/>Totally, it is a kind of global 'aha' moment too for me. All your points are like I felt them during my Rust experience but didn't really grasp or "put a name" on it. Especially, it wasn't clear to me that some compiler errors were due to incompletness, and I feel like knowing this would have been of great help in the way to manage the compiler and its messages, and knowing it now will definitely helps me in my future Rust experience (if any).

The paper was an interesting read, thanks! I particularly appreciated the examples showing how users of Rust have to understand the internals of the borrow checker.

I did some user studies of a language I designed that uses ownership, and I managed to get most participants to work successfully with ownership. However, the ownership system was substantially simpler than Rust’s.
