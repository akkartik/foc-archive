        "text": "&gt; How do you handle functions that take two arguments?\n\nStill considering different approaches, in combination with different modes of time travel, different ways of storing state internally, to see what feels good and avoids perf cliffs.\n\nMy current favourite is what you mentioned: functions don't open themselves to input until they have data waiting at every inlet. If multiple pieces of data arrive at one inlet before other inlets are filled, we just do last-write-wins. If you want a queue instead, that could just be a special kind of edge. I call this idea \"perching\" because it's like the data point is perched on the lip of the function, waiting until the function opens up.\n\nAnother option is that data points \"paint\" the edges they travel along, leaving a permanent trail of their data value. When a function receives a data point at an inlet, it can accept that input and produce a result even if other inlets don't have a data point waiting at them, so long as those inlet edges have previously been painted with a value. This is sort of like a version of FRP-style behaviours \/ signals depicted as standing waves, where the initial wavefront is a point. It's also analogous to the way that variables in a scope work, which are in essence painted with a value as the instruction pointer passes over them to do an assignment and they remain so painted until the next assignment. (Yes, I do spend a lot of time thinking of our common abstract execution metaphors as little machines with agency which, I know, is a \"no-no\" in some technical writing circles.)\n\nPainting seems really interesting and I definitely haven't explored it enough, but I have a raft of concerns that don't seem to be fading as I consider it more. Painting adds several new kinds of complexity (compared to perching and other ideas), and requires a whole additional set of editor tools. There might not be a good way for the artist to embody painted edges the way they can embody points — what would \"painted edges: the game\" be like, and is that useful for programming?\n\nThere's another problem that both painting and perching have, which I only really started to appreciate after exploring painting in depth. Currently, the act of a data point arriving at a function is two things combined together that might need to be separate — it's the provision of data, and it's the initiation of that function's execution. It's both (eg) a value and a \"bang\". I might want to separate these things, so that the system isn't \"complecting what and when\" to borrow a Hickeyism. (And that's 25¢ in the jar.)\n\nAnd yes, of course, I am very resistant to any idea that crosses my path that'd lead to hidden state. Much like incidental complexity (which Hest warmly embraces), hidden state is something that will inevitably happen in some sense or another, but I want to be very careful about what things I hide, and how.\n\nSo, what do you think? Should I separate the movement of data and the movement of execution? There are lots of ways to do that. If you were providing multiple pieces of data to a function, how might you do it?",

When defining a function within Hest, you draw a graphic \"icon\" for that function using the vector art tools, and lay out the code next to that graphic. You also connect the code to the graphic as needed to (say) alter the graphic in response to state (because functions in Hest can be stateful). If you want to have (say) a row of inlet ports along the top of the graphic, you'd draw what those ports should look like, tell Hest to treat them as ports (which means they'll accept edge connections from outside), and route where the incoming data should go.",
