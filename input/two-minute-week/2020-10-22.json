I estimate I spend 25% of my time fixing cross platform builds\/CI. etc.  This has to stop; I have lost weeks to figuring out all these issues.  Discovering that vcpkg solves most of my problems was a revelation; it is laughably easy to build complex libraries and link them into your projects.\nI've also been updating to the ImGui docking branch. This is going to be great for live coding; giving you more surface area to put your various windows and tools. This screenshot is an example across my 3 monitors; I will shortly have the visual pieces up and running too.",
