Hello all. My name is Rashad Gover and I’m a second year college student in L.A. I’m primarily interested in functional programming, logic programming, denotational semantics, PLT, type theory, applied category theory, and the formal verification of programs. My main goals are to improve the ergonomics of programming languages, come up with methods for mathematically proving the correctness of programs, and come up with better ways of teaching programming and computer science. I am still new to a lot of this stuff so I look forward to learning a lot from the more experienced members of this group. I look forward to doing 1-on-1’s with some of you:grin: Cheers to the future of coding:beers:
