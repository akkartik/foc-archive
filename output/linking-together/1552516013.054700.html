The differences between #thinking-together and #linking-together are very subtle and frankly I donâ€™t really understand what qualifies for which one. Also, if I recall correctly, that's just the channels each new Slack starts with by default, so it's not that we have them for a really good reason. Many other communities have an #off-topic channel instead, which I think makes it a little easier to distinguish between what goes where.
