Or, instead, if you started from a place of \"computers could be better\" broadly and accumulated a whole laundry list of things that could be done differently and tried to pull them together — if so, you're signing up for a much harder challenge, one that will require the involvement of many people, and thus you'll need to work very hard on communicating the problem and convincing people to help.
