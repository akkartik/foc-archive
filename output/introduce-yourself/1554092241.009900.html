:wave: I'm Vitorio, found this place from an HN comment.  I'm a UX designer and user researcher by day, but I've got Bret Victor's 2014 CDG research agenda tacked up on my wall, and I think there are a lot more intersections between this sort of work and more qualitative knowledge work (like user research) than is being broadly pursued.  I wrote up some early armchair Dynamicland commentary here: <a href="http://vitor.io/on-dynamicland">http://vitor.io/on-dynamicland</a> and followed it up on Jason Brennan's forum here: <a href="http://discuss.nearthespeedoflight.com/t/dynamicland/86/9">http://discuss.nearthespeedoflight.com/t/dynamicland/86/9</a> (thoughts gratefully welcomed!)

On <a href="http://vitor.io/on-dynamicland">http://vitor.io/on-dynamicland</a><br/><br/>There seem to be three distinct goals that tend to get conflated:<br/><br/>1. Seeing as you create.<br/>2. Seeing what others have created. Or rather, creating in a way that makes creations easy for others to appreciate/remix/contribute to.<br/>3. Keeping a closely-coupled group on a single page about what they are seeing.<br/><br/>All three directions seem complementary, in that there's no reason they can't steal ideas from each other. The eventual goal seems like a workspace that supports groups spanning a spectrum of sizes (including individuals), and that is easy to export from one group to another.

On <a href="http://discuss.nearthespeedoflight.com/t/dynamicland/86">http://discuss.nearthespeedoflight.com/t/dynamicland/86</a><br/><br/>I think the most difficult thing about Dynamicland is importing a shared vocabulary of a group when you aren't part of the group. It's like the difficulty of understanding the implementation of some large system, but now many times harder.<br/><br/>It's easy to think this difficulty is comparable to the difficulty of getting to Oakland, or of getting invited into Dynamicland. But I think it's orders of magnitude harder. It's the "essential complexity" here.<br/><br/>As you point out, there are two ways to go about it:<br/><br/>a) Emphasize automation first, and try to create a single space with bespoke hardware and software in hopes that it automatically facilitates a wide range of conversations.<br/><br/>b) Emphasize the facilitation, and hope that the variables introduced by the facilitators don't make it too intractable to make generalities about the approach. Then hope that the lessons learned are amenable to automation.<br/><br/>Both seem hard.<br/><br/>(Thanks for reminding me of this forum. I'd signed up back when it was called tbd.cool.)
