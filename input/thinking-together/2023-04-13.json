The fact that dynamic land has effects in the actual world through its words makes this fact seem to be far from a coincidence. Sadly, Elephant 2000 isn't in Bret's list of papers, so I can't be certain he has read it, but I'd be surprised to find out this is an accident.\n\nDefinitely recommend reading Searle or Austin on speech acts. Searle is definitely less jargon heavy and incredibly readable.",
