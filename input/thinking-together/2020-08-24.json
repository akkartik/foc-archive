From that perspective, logical inference is sort of... program synthesis, I think? More broadly, finding elements that occupy a type that represents a proposition.\n\nIt could be that logical inference is (IIUC) inherently search-oriented, so people who make \"models of computation\" don't see it as a good primitive operation: too many steps and decisions behind the scenes.
