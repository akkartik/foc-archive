Just finished watching it (some opinionated notes at <a href="1551672178.123100.html#1551738841.152900">1.551738.html&hellip;</a>), and one thing it got me thinking about again is this "idea maze" for different potential paths to get "to" the future of programming that I've been noodling on for a couple of weeks (<a href="1550090952.045000.html#1550105989.048100">1.550105.html&hellip;</a>). So some new ideas for questions to ask ourselves that may act as a "sorting hat" to get us collaborating with like-minded people:<br/><br/>• <em>Optimizing for learnability vs power once learned.</em> There's lots of overlap between these categories, things that would work for either side, and that's ok. But what's your fundamental goal/intention?<br/><br/>• <em>Simple vs complex use-cases.</em> (Jonathan Edwards refers to this in a couple of ways in the above interview. On the one hand, focusing on how people learn programming or new tools vs how experts use tools. There he prefers simple use cases. The experience of learning is anything but simple, but the programs beginners try to write are typically simpler than what experts try to do. On the other hand, Jonathan also draws a distinction between people supporting just "canned parameterizable components" and "full on programming". So his approach seems to be to go as simple as possible but not so simple that you lose the essence of programming. There may be other ways to slice this dimension.)<br/><br/>• <em>Adding new layers to the stack vs redoing existing layers.</em> I suspect any new prototype has to start out building at the top, but is the intention to eventually burrow down? (It seems to be Jonathan's intention, though it wasn't really clear what the plan is to get there. Perhaps the attempts at creating new institutions fit here, hoping to inspire others to run with prototypes, retrofitting them back into existing stacks? I'm skeptical that existing power users can be relied upon to make truly deconstructive moves on a tool or layer that they're fluent with. The incentives don't work.)<br/><br/>Anyway, that's a few more bends in the idea maze. I'd love for others to add to this list, going beyond this particular interview. (My previous comment linked above had 4 questions as well, with one point repeated here.)<br/><br/>/cc <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span> <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Peter Abrahamsen</span>
