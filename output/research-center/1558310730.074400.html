This is a followup to my point about picking the right high level goals. Englebart wanted to create systems for human collaboration on problem solving, while Alan Kay at PARC wanted to create a personal computer (the dynabook). Both research projects used similar technology (windows, the mouse, etc), but the projects had very different goals.<br/><br/>Brett Victor has a nice analysis of why the goals matter, and about what might have been lost due to adopting the PARC approach over the NLS approach: <a href="http://worrydream.com/Engelbart/">http://worrydream.com/Engelbart/</a>
