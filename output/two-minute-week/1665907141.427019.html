Beginnings of an environment for building programs live. Includes some discussion of how the program is represented, including version history.<br/><br/>This is all nothing new compared to Emacs, Lisp, Smalltalk, etc. What draws me to this project is trying to implement these features on a much simpler and so hopefully easier to learn and more self-sufficient stack.<br/><br/>This project has been fermenting in a couple of past threads:<br/>• <a href="../share-your-work/1665503282.267399.html">../share-your-work/1665503282.267399.html</a><br/>• <a href="../devlog-together/1665594315.849469.html">../devlog-together/1665594315.849469.html</a><br/>Next step: use the version history to recover from errors. The big epiphany for me has been that I can recover from errors without restarting the entire program -- as long as programs submit to LÖVE's constraints: purely synchronous programming with an event loop, so that no single function can be long-lived. You can write any programs you like as long as they aren't batch programs.

I hope you appreciate the depth of what this community has done to me over the past 4 years!

Very nice!  For a long time I've been thinking about this versioning thing; and how to do it.  I like your manual approach (as apposed to using git, for example).  What I'd like to see in tools like Sonic Pi, is the ability to record and play back a session like this.  Too often moments in live performances are lost to whatever the state was at the time; but having a slider and a way to go back to a given point would be a really nice feature.  Of course, with animation, you have to time-stamp each change, and there may be issues with having everything turn out exactly the same.  But it would still be a really useful feature.

Does LÖVE play well with Lua's builtin coroutines?  Seems like maybe <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=8531">https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=8531</a>.  Of course, coroutines are synchronous, long lived functions, and so you need to keep in mind when to <tt>coroutine.yield()</tt> and what might change between from resumes.
