Hi folks! I'm Ilari, a developer at a Finnish startup Valaa Technologies (colleague of Ville and Iridian above :point_up_2:). To be a bit grandiose: We're creating what could be called a new paradigm of web coding, called ValOS (Valaa Open System). In practice it isn't that different from all the black magic things that something like Meteor framework does (automatic live updates to all displayed data between multiple users, etc). But on the background, it is a deeper rethinking of the coding model (especially distribution of code, and the frontend/backend separation), instead of piling more and more stuff on top of current stacks. Anyway, we can discuss our thing more on the channels, but I think it was relevant to intro since it's very relevant for why I am here. Because what we are doing is is directly in the frontlines of the future of coding. I'm happy to talk about this more.<br/><br/>I've personally been coding from something like age of ten, and I've always been interested in experimenting with things. Professionally I've been a (full-stack) coder for approx. 7 years. I have an educational background in usability, and often call myself a human-geek interface. My personal passions, in addition to coding, are storytelling and games. Hopefully I'll manage to combine all these things at some point. Hopefully soon.<br/><br/>Currently the stuff I'm most interested in are the possibilities of ValOS resource model, combined with how quick code experimentation with ValOS is. As a coder, I want to both see and use immediate results instead of having to jump through hoops. If I hadn't encountered ValaaTech, I'd be doing similar experimentation with Meteor.
