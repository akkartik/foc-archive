        "text": "Hello friends,\n\nMy father was having some difficulty with Exercise 1.66 of Seven Sketches.  Thought you might get something out of my reply.\n\n&gt;&gt; Exercise 1.66. Let (P, ≤) be a preorder, and recall the notion of opposite preorder from Example 1.58.\n\nLet's do this.  I'm under the weather today, so some easy proofs are just the thing.  We open up all the definitions, and the proofs fall out. Exercise 1.66 is really great, a Monument Valley of Mathematics.  The concepts are deep.  The proofs are simple.  (I have adjusted notation in your quoted bits.)\n\nStart with the basics.  The preorder (P, ≤) is a set P and relation ≤ that is\n\t\n\treflexive: p ≤ p for all p ∈ P, and\n\ttransitive: if p ≤ q and q ≤ r then p ≤ r for p, q, r ∈ P.\n\nThe opposite preorder op(P) := (P, ≥) flips the order of arguments so p ≥ q if q ≤ p. — Isn't ≥ the most obvious symbol?\n\nNotice that the ≤ of (P, ≤) is implicit in op(P).  Math texts like their implicitness.  There *is* a regularity to it; however, it can be disorienting if you aren't following along perfectly.  The alternative explicitness would likely overwhelm with details.\n\n&gt;&gt; 1. Show that the set ↑(p) := {p' ∈ P | p ≤ p'} is an upper set, for any p ∈ P.\n\nSo ↑(p) is the set of all things bigger than p.  (Non-strictly of course because saying \"at least as big as\" sounds terrible.)\n\nWhat's an upper set?\n\n\tFor a preorder (P, ≤) an upper set in P is a subset U of P such that if p ∈ U and p ≤ q, then q ∈ U.\n\nIn other words, an upper set is part of the top of P.  So (1) is trivial.  ↑(p) is exactly the part of the top of P with p at the bottom and nothing else hanging on the sides.  Let's unwind the definitions to do this formally.\n\nConsider q ∈ ↑(p).  This means p ≤ q.  Take r where q ≤ r.  By transitivity p ≤ r.  This means r ∈ ↑(p).\n\nThis sort of rhythm makes a logician happy.  What makes a mathematician happy?  Considering the converse.  Is every upper set ↑(p) for some p?\n\nNo!  We only need two elements {a, b} for a counterexample where a and b are incomparable – neither a ≤ b nor b ≤ a.  Generalize?  Whenever p and q are incomparable, ↑(p) ∪ ↑(q) will be an upper set, but there won't be an r such that ↑(r) = ↑(p) ∪ ↑(q).\n\nMaybe we could extend the definition of ↑ to sets.  We would want ↑({p, q}) = ↑(p) ∪ ↑(q).  So for any set S, let ↑(S) := {p ∈ P | s ≤ p for some s ∈ S}.  This gives us a neat little way to characterize upper sets.  U is an upper set if and only if ↑(U) = U.  Nice, natural.  An upper set is one closed under ↑.\n\nAnother path of inquiry... given p and q, could there sometimes be a special, best r, such that both p, q ∈ ↑(r)?  What qualities would this best r have?  Well if p ∈ ↑(q), then r should be equivalent to q.  Moreover for some s if both p, q ∈ ↑(s), then s ∈ ↑(r).  Turns our there's a name for this kind of r, it's the meet of {p, q}.  So you should read Section 1.3.\n\nOne more idea... What happens when we take a totally ordered set, one in which every two elements are comparable.  Then is every upper set ↑(p) for some p?\n\nNo!  Consider (ℕ, ≥).  All of ℕ is certainly an upper set, but ↑(n) never catches all of ℕ not for any n ∈ ℕ.  How about we extend ℕ with this limit point ω &lt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ordinal_number&gt;!  Or try this: start with the rational numbers, fill them in somehow &lt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dedekind_cut&gt;.  Generalizing to preorders, we eventually discover Galois connections &lt;https:\/\/ncatlab.org\/nlab\/show\/MacNeille+completion&gt;.  Read Section 1.4.\n\nI told you this book knows what it's doing.",
