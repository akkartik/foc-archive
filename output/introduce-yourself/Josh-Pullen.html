Hi everyone! :grin: I am Josh. (PullJosh on the internet)<br/><br/>I am a college student now, planning to become a high school math &amp; computer science teacher.<br/><br/>As a kid, I spent almost all my time on Scratch, where I found a community of like-minded kids who loved to code.<br/><br/>Nowadays, Iâ€™m mostly doing web development. I love it, but I haven't found the same community as I had on Scratch.<br/><br/>To that end, I am trying to build a visual web coding tool that serves much the same purpose as Scratch did for me. It should be a gentle on-ramp to web development that encourages expressing yourself, building &amp; hacking together, and sharing your work.<br/><br/>Hopefully it can happen. :crossed_fingers:
