Since Steve left, there is no one really organizing these in NYC, but I think it nice to put a face to names and meet in person to discuss ideas. I'm thinking if it's less than ten of us we can use some of the public available spaces to host for now. Does the 12th or 13th work for people? Just drop a quick message here an we'll figure it out together.",
