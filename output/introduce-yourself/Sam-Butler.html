Hey all, my name is Sam.  Glad to join this community.<br/><br/>I freelance part-time, and spend most of my days working on what seems most important, for better future outcomes and better futures we'll all experience.<br/><br/>That often includes digital things, based on the collaborative potential that the Internet enables — as well as the risks / downsides / opportunity costs, of the attention economy and big tech.<br/><br/>On that note, here are two concepts I've been reflecting on for some time, and I would love to explore with the FOC community:<br/><br/><b>1</b>. <b>A substrate for communication, collaboration, and coordination — built on our existing social graphs.</b><br/><br/>I've started using LinkedIn as a way to communicate above the walled garden chat communities.<br/><br/>I'm doing this to enable discoverability + accessibility + knowledge-sharing with my work.  Much of the professional world — at least in subject areas I'm focused on — is on LinkedIn.  By posting content and having discussions there, it enables anybody who may be interested in what I'm working on it to discover it — and likewise, me to discover them.<br/><br/>For this use case, and many others, it seems uncontroversial that we'll move away from centralized social networks — to networks that are more free, user-centric,  and dynamic.<br/><br/>To start this transition, it seems that the simplest and surest first step is having access to our <b>graph data</b> — so that we can <b>use it</b> and <b>build/experiment on it</b>.<br/><br/>Specifically, I'm talking about:<br/><br/>1. Export my contacts from LinkedIn, Facebook, and other social networks, using their APIs<br/>2. Import those contacts into a new substrate/protocol, with some simple structure to help with identification.  (For example, to tell the difference between two contacts named "Bret Victor."  Or, if each of us have a "Bret Victor" in our contacts, an intelligent way to recognize if they are or are not the same person.  Email or phone number could be a useful "anchor" for this — and better approaches could certainly be possible as well. )<br/>3. Once I have all of my contacts accessible — I just want some simple functionality to <b>send messages</b>, and the ability to <b>tinker/experiment with new ways of interacting</b> on top of this new substrate.<br/>Part 1 is feasible today.  Part 2 seems like it requires some dedicated thought and design.  Part 3 only comes after Part 1, and along with Part 2.<br/><br/>If anybody is interested in this type of thing, I'd love to hear thoughts and collaborate.  Note that this approach isn't about onboarding to a new network, it's about migrating our existing networks to a new and dynamic environment.  Also this is envisioned more of a commons / protocol initiative, not as a new network itself.<br/><br/>2. <b>A better browser — for embodied browsing, better bookmarking and tabs, configurable interfaces and websites, etc.</b><br/><br/>• A tool to use <a href="https://github.com/midiblocks/handsfree">face / hand / motion tracking in front-ends and browsers</a><br/>• New browser capabilities like <a href="https://vivaldi.com/">tab management</a>, privacy, custom macros, auto quitting tab processes when memory runs high<br/>• Social bookmarking / knowledge management<br/>• <a href="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/">Modifying website interfaces</a><br/>I want an open-source browser that starts pulling some of things capabilities together, makes them available, and enables us to keep building on top.<br/><br/>I want the embodied browsing experience of pulling my hand down through the air, like Luke Skywalker setting down the X-Wing on Dagobah, to scroll down on articles and feeds — turning computer time into embodied, physical activity.<br/><br/>When I have shit tons of tabs open, I want my browser to automatically quit the process of the oldest tabs — not x-ing them out, but just freeing up the memory — so I don't have to do that myself.<br/><br/>I want to experiment with social bookmarking, and I don't want to depend on an extension or a SaaS product to do it.<br/><br/>I want to be able to modify website interfaces — and have those preferences / customizations saved, for whenever I return.<br/><br/>I want to be able to experiment with digital virtual assistants and building my own automated processes — e.g. for specific websites as well.<br/><br/>There could be limitless other possibilities too — especially if the browser is open-source and configurable.<br/><br/>It seems like a lot of the tooling for this is already built out, either in extensions or in experimental GitHub repos.  I am very okay with hacky and experimental.<br/><br/>I just want to start putting this together and start experimenting / building / seeing if there is anything viable here.  I've never worked with browser software, and I'm not going to embark on that journey solo I don't think — so if anybody else wants these types of capabilities too, let's explore making them!
