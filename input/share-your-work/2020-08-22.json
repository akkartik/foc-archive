It went very badly. For various path dependent reasons, I found most of the \"hard parts\" of maths and physics easy and natural, whereas they very much did not. My -- extremely embarrassing in retrospect -- perception was that they were being willfully thick just to vex me, and I was an absolute _asshole_ to them for \"not getting it\" and \"not trying hard enough\" and so on.\n\nLater, I read <https:\/\/creatorsvancouver.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/rocky-road-from-actions-to-intentions.pdf|a study> conducted by Elizabeth Newton regarding \"Tappers and Listeners\" that's since gotten repeated a bit in the popular science press, It really helped me to understand what was going on there and improve my own ability to communicate. The TL;DR of the study provided in Heath and Heath's _Made to Stick_ conveys the point well enough:\n\n&gt; _Tappers received a list of twenty-five well-known songs, such as “Happy Birthday to You” and “The Star Spangled Banner.” Each tapper was asked to pick a song and tap out the rhythm to a listener (by knocking on a table). The listener’s job was to guess the song, based on the rhythm being tapped._\n&gt; _The listener’s job in this game is quite difficult. Over the course of Newton’s experiment, 120 songs were tapped out. Listeners guessed only 2.5 percent of the songs: 3 out of 120._\n&gt; _But here’s what made the result worthy of a dissertation in psychology. Before the listeners guessed the name of the song, Newton asked the tappers to predict the odds that the listeners would guess correctly. They predicted that the odds were 50 percent. *The tappers got their message across 1 time in 40, but they thought they were getting their message across 1 time in 2.* Why?_\n&gt; _When a tapper taps, she is hearing the song in her head. Go ahead and try it for yourself — tap out “The Star-Spangled Banner.” It’s impossible to avoid hearing the tune in your head. Meanwhile, the listeners can’t hear that tune — all they can hear is a bunch of disconnected taps, like a kind of bizarre Morse Code._\n&gt; _In the experiment, tappers are flabbergasted at how hard the listeners seem to be working to pick up the tune. Isn’t the song obvious? The tappers’ expressions, when a listener guesses “Happy Birthday to You” for “The Star-Spangled Banner,” are priceless: How could you be so stupid?_\n&gt; _It’s hard to be a tapper. The problem is that tappers have been given knowledge (the song title) that makes it impossible for them to imagine what it’s like to lack that knowledge. When they’re tapping, they can’t imagine what it’s like for the listeners to hear isolated taps rather than a song. This is the Curse of Knowledge. Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has “cursed” us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because we can’t readily re-create our listeners’ state of mind._\nWhen we try to communicate something to a (virtual) room full of intelligent people operating in good faith and find that they cannot understand what we're saying, we have a choice: either accept that we haven't said our piece in a way that successfully translates the knowledge in our head -- which is _necessarily_ much larger than the message we have transmitted -- or we can blame the listeners for our own failure. One way leads to effective communication and positive relationships, the other one to being the same kind of asshole I was in the cautionary tale with which I started this message.",
