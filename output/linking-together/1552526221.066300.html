Personally, I just keep up with all threads, so it doesn't matter to me. But if it did, I'd say that I don't recognize a meaningful distinction between what's been shared on either channel. It might be helpful if, from now on, we use "random" for off topic posts. I think that (in time) that distinction would be apparent regardless of what the channel is named.
