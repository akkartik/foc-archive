Anyway... Upon finding this place, my original hope was to get this Steve Krouse guy to join our collaboration; but perhaps it should be the other way around! There is a lot of rich stuff here!<br/><br/>I'd love to talk more some time, and perhaps get on a call to exchange some thoughts and viewpoints that are not so practical via text.<br/><br/>I do think it would be great to share a picture of what we have done to collaborate and share, and compare with what is going on here at Future Programming; and then perhaps merge efforts and resources (or at the very least, collaborate between them).
