Hi folks! I ought introduce myself so that I don’t seem like a complete rando at Saturday’s meetup. I moved to London from the US only a few months ago. I’m doing my best to meet people and make friends!<br/><br/>Professionally, I’m am SRE. Personally, I am interested in how computers work, computer and internet history (ask me about my collection of obscure computer books), text entry systems, and AI. By AI I mean that I’m more interested in the end-use of AI, and the societal impacts thereof, than how statistical inference works.<br/><br/>Since moving to London I’ve been taking a break from work to hang out with my son and write a blog. Recently, a <a href="https://www.cyberdemon.org/2023/03/29/age-of-ai-skill-atrophy.html">blog post</a> urging people not to stop learning despite the strength of ChatGPT went very mildly viral.
