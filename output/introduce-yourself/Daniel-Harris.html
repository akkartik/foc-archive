Hello everyone! My name is Daniel and my handle everywhere is <em>dahacouk</em>. I found the FoC whilst also finding the Local-First community and attending the meeting in Berlin this year. I think the main thing that drives me is the need to be in control of my environment, be that physical or digital. Not the easiest theme to pick for one's life's work, but hey!<br/><br/>I don't code anymore, but I do long to build little useful collaborative apps without coding. It all started way back with a ZX81... Spectrum... Amiga... PC... Mac. I studied art in the late 80s. Ran an ISP in the mid 90s. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ETwSBxKeF6i634c4lb2-GOI4niRfGcgTxL2pntXxiMg/edit#heading=h.cvl3gpy4xt5x">Dreamed and talked</a> of having interoperability and open protocols ubiquitous in every sector through the 00s, and started a nonprofit open source research project. Started building demonstrations in the early 10s with EU research funding. Arrived in the 20s with a team and the beginnings of an app to build mini apps: <em>like if Excel could build apps and not just spreadsheets</em>, and we could email them to each other. My projects are on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dahacouk">LinkedIn</a> as I don't want to break the rules! :wink: So, now I'm immersed in: no-code, local-first and malleable-software isms. I've <a href="../share-your-work/1727700811.071079.html">shared our work</a> in #share-your-work<br/><br/>What I'm most interested in is how end-users can build and alter simple apps. Rather than building a typical fine-grained programming environment, I'm wondering about what people do most when interacting with services and data in their daily lives: create and modify things, manage relationships between things. List, filter, analyse and select/group things. What minimal set of user-interface and compute blocks could be configured and combined to provide a viable environment for people to manage their digital lives?<br/><br/>So, yes, I'm excited about never having to go to a website or app (where my data is currently siloed) ever again. For instance, I'd like to have a consistent shopping interface that I can configure and tailor to my needs through which I can access all shops: a personal Amazon if you will. So, I guess that means services become headless? Luckily the ubiquity of APIs makes this dream more viable. The trick is to make it understandable and attractive â€“ and I'm beginning to think that this is the 'not the easy part'! :wink: Look forward to hanging out in FoC and sharing our experiments. Cheers!
