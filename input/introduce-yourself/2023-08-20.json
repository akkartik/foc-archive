Super stoked to be part of this community!\n\nI’m a quant trader by day, but I really enjoy prototyping research tools after work and during the weekends (particularly in academic research). The design space for computing is so rich, I’m always dumbfounded and excited by all the possibilities. I find a lot of inspiration from the typical suspects: Alan Kay, Bret Victor, Maggie Appleton, Douglas Engelbart, etc.\n\nI write down some of my thoughts on <https:\/\/www.hajeon.xyz\/|my blog> from time-to-time.
