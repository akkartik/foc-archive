I've been exploring combining Reactive UI components (those that separate the state, the methods to update the state, and computed values such as the UI), with the same methods given as <em>tools</em> to LLM-powered agent. The user can then either use the UI as normal or ask the AI to act on the state: with perfect fidelity between the two.<br/><br/>I want to see if there is an abstraction concise enough for such components to live on the server instead of the client to enable multiplayer realtime collaboration across many humans and agents. It ought to be possible to accomplish this with much less plumbing.
