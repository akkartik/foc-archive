A while ago I did a little interview series with game developers (that's not really relevant to this group, but if you’re interested: <a href="https://medium.com/@stefanlesser/">https://medium.com/@stefanlesser/</a>). Now I’m thinking about doing a series with all kinds of software developers about productivity and complexity in software development. I believe these are two highly important areas of focus to figure out what software development should be like in the future.<br/><br/>I don’t think the interviews will be as long as the game developer ones, ideally more like a 5-10 min read.<br/><br/>I’d love your input on this!<br/><br/>1. What do you think about this? Does that sound interesting at all? Would you read interviews like that?<br/>2. What questions would you like me to ask? What would you like to read about that broadly fits the productivity and complexity theme?<br/><br/>I have a set of 15 questions ready, which I’m happy to share here, but I’ll leave them out for now, just to not frame the discussion upfront and shut out potentially interesting ideas that wouldn’t come up otherwise.<br/><br/>Would also love to interview some of you. Let me know if you’re interested in writing responses to a set of questions about productivity and complexity in programming.<br/><br/>My plan is to publish them as part of my (hopefully for real this time) upcoming blog about the same topics.

Cool! I like this idea a lot. One way to frame is almost like a Steve-Blank-style get-out-of-the-building customer interview. I’d be curious to ask programmers about the emotions they feel about different languages they like and don’t like, and about how they’d describe their biggest frustrations with programming<br/><br/>However I think who you interview is the most important question. I’d be more interested in customer interviews with non-programmers or beginner programmers than with expert programmers, but that’s a matter of taste I guess

Here are btw the questions I already had on my list: <br/><br/>About<br/>- What's your name, job title, and for which company do you work?<br/>- How would you describe what you do in a Tweet?<br/><br/>Productivity<br/>- What does productivity mean for you? What distinguishes a productive developer from a not so productive one?<br/>- Before you can write code, you need to think about it. What does your thinking process look like and which techniques and tools do you use before typing code into an editor?<br/>- What was the most effective change you ever made to your process that increased your productivity as programmer?<br/>- Have you ever used a tool for something different than it was meant for? What was the tool, and what did you use it for?<br/>- What's the biggest productivity trap you fell into, or see others fall into frequently, and how do you prevent yourself from making that mistake?<br/><br/>Complexity<br/>- What's the biggest source for complexity in your day to day work?<br/>- How do know that something is too complex and needs to be made simpler?<br/>- Which techniques do you use to make something simpler?<br/>- What changes, when you are getting better at managing complexity?<br/>- Imagine you’re building a new project from scratch and you can design the technical architecture without any constraints. Which techniques, patterns and frameworks do you rely on to keep things simple or at least manageable?<br/>- What's the most controversial or unorthodox tip you ever heard about dealing with complexity? Does it work?<br/>- What's one thing in software development you wish to be simpler?<br/><br/>Resources<br/>- What is the link (to an article, book, paper, or video) that you send most often to others and why do you share it? (Feel free to list several, if you have more than one.)<br/>- Which person do you follow passionately on the Internet and read and watch everything they create and share? (Feel free to list several, if you have more than one.)<br/><br/>Multiply<br/>- Which question should I have asked, but didn’t, and would you like to read about in future interviews?<br/>- Who else should I ask all these questions next?<br/>- How can people find you on the internet? Which URLs do you want to share? (Website, GitHub, Twitter, Instagram, etc.)
