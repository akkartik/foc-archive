Hi all! I’m a mostly self-taught web developer interested in GUI programming. I have that unfortunate type of personality very high in Openness and very low on Conscientiousness which means that I’m infinitely curious about a whole lot of things but I end up doing very little about it. My main interest around the topic of this Slack is the idea of a cross-platform GUI library that would allow the implementation of apps that would work wonderfully on all 3 big operating systems. I’m a huge fan of the work of Alan Kay at VPRI.
