Hi,<br/>I've been following along this group, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span>'s podcast, the SomethingNew repo on github, ... for a while now but haven't introduced myself yet. My name is Felix and I'm studying CS in Karlsruhe, Germany at the moment. My ideas about FP started with the wish to have a tool that combines the best part of Excel, Jupyter Notebooks and OneNote and have since evolved into Structured Editing, UI Design, Programming Languages and so much more areas. It's great to see that other people are thinking about similar stuff as well.
