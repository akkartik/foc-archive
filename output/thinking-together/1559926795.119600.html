&gt; The user was easily able to whip up something fairly complex (so far so good!) but then they ran into a problem where they said something like (pointing) "I want this value... here".<br/><br/>I watched the video. Here's my response.<br/><br/>Suppose you have a node and wire visual programming language, a dataflow language. Values flow into the input terminals of a node, are processed, and new values flow out of the output terminals.<br/><br/>A typical program is just a canvas full of nodes and wires, a flow diagram. If the user thinks "I want this value... here", then it's easy. They just run a wire from the output terminal where the value is generated, to the input terminal where they need the value. There are no nested scopes here, all values are equally accessible, so there is no problem.<br/><br/>We've solved the problem that Chris Granger identifies in the video, and we've done it using a pure functional visual programming language.
