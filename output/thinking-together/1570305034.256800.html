<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> I am thinking more about how there is a kind of "pleasure in learning about lots of minute details" that is common among coders, and people who think that way will tend to create systems that are impenetrable to people who <em>don't</em> think/feel that way.<br/><br/>I read what you're saying as more about the difficulty of <em>using</em> a system to create elegance, which I think comes from practice and understanding? But <em>getting</em> that understanding is what's impeded by the <em>system itself</em> being over-complex.
