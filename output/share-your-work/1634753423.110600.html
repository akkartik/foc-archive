Hey guys, I don't know if you remember my program MockMechanics? I know it's been a while, I've been working on the code instead of making videos and I was also busy with work, but here's a new video, I show how I recreated that 4 color memory game (Simon) without using any code. I'll try to make machine videos more regularly from now on. So what do you think?<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM8ljtPA0ZM&amp;ab_channel=MockMechanics">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM8ljtPA0ZM&amp;ab_channel=MockMechanics</a><br/><br/>Here's a preview:

Oh my god I absolutely LOVE the moment when you physically flip the detector panel over at 1:09 to reveal how it works. You are doing a great job retaining the physicality of the world where it works, and breaking it where it doesn't.

Thanks Chris, I could have put the detectors in another layer so whenever I wanted access to them I could show the right layer all nice and proper. But putting them on a panel I can just flip open with the mouse physically is so much easier. Once again my laziness served me well :grinning:

We remember.  Love the physicality of it.  The interaction with the bottom middle logic popup panel is interesting, like an entirely different mode of expression.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@William Taysom</span>Â Thanks, I'm often surprised by how powerful the motherboard programming is (the logic panel as you call it), that was kind of an accident. Back in the early days, each motherboard contained a little snippet of Clojure code but I noticed that a lot of them were simple if/them clauses and when they weren't you could simplify them to be so by making the other logic physical, if you know what I mean? For instance instead of writing code to detect a recent button press in the Simon game by having a Clojure variable to keep track of the last time a button was pressed, I just created a physical thingamajig that is in a certain state for a while after each button press. So if each motherboard can just be simple if/then statements with or/and/not conditions, then it can be represented by a simple graph. Even things I thought couldn't be simplified this way like a while loop turned out to be possible, the "player" circuit is a physical while loop for instance.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mariano Guerra</span> Thanks, the Review Jam sounds like a great idea! Perfect not only to get real feedback but also try some really interesting tools from the other people here. I have to focus on work for a few weeks and trying all those tools does sound time consuming but since it's still a month away I think I probably can make it. I'll prepare a new version when I can, it's more involved than you would think, that's why the version on my site is so old, but I'll get it done.
