I built a little voice recorder in Lua Carousel last night<br/><br/><a href="https://akkartik.itch.io/carousel/devlog/651711/new-version-after-9-days">https://akkartik.itch.io/carousel/devlog/651711/new-version-after-9-days</a><br/><br/>One little detail here involves Android permissions. I almost ended up asking for microphone permissions in Lua Carousel. Luckily I managed to stop and ask myself what the user experience is. "Hi, I'm Lua Carousel, could I please have access to your mic?" Ick! It seems like a bad idea to ask for a permission for the whole app just in case some single script uses it. Probably affects the conversions from this particular blog post, but I don't want to feel like I'm contributing to the general fatigue over apps asking for permissions. :shrug::skin-tone-3:
