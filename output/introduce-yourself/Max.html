Hi everyone :wave:,<br/><br/>Not sure exactly where I found FoC but great to be here.<br/><br/>I'm a bit of a generalist out of Berlin. Interests of mine are more broad than deep and include technology, philosophy and economics. I have been a programming hobbyist since taking a handful CS courses in college and now my involvement with it has ramped up.<br/><br/>Anyways, with my intro, I wanted to share a short article I researched and wrote after seeing connections between a talk and a book I was simultaneously reading. There has been some interesting commentary on reddit, nonetheless I think you all may find it interesting and I would love to learn from you: <a href="https://blog.deta.sh/assembly/">https://blog.deta.sh/assembly/</a><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Max
