Hi all, my friend Sarah Stern at Cultivate is starting an initiative to match tech talent with jobs in the progressive movement. I said I'd share this with this community. From her:<br/><br/><em>To win in 2020, we need the best and the brightest in tech to join the progressive movement. We just launched <b>All Hands</b>: a tech talent matchmaker, functioning as a curated resume bank + jobs board where we make introductions to orgs that are hiring.</em> <br/><br/><em>We’re looking for product + engineering talent looking to make the switch to progressive tech. Apply here to join the All Hands talent pool &gt;&gt; <a href="https://all-hands.us">https://all-hands.us</a></em>

What is the progressive movement? I’ve never heard of it (:flag-ca: ). All I can find online is the Progressive Era, which seems to have ended in the 1920s.

"Progressive" is the range of politics between the center-left and far left. For us Canadians it'd definitely be the NDP, and possibly even further to the left with things like the Courage Coalition (<a href="http://www.couragecoalition.ca/">http://www.couragecoalition.ca/</a>), and for the US it'd be Democratic Socialists.<br/><br/>The term "movement" is meant to establish that it's operating at the level of individual citizens, not at the level of political party officials, think tanks and lobbyists, media, corporations, etc. — though often those latter groups will call what they're doing a "movement" in an attempt to seem more authentic and of the people.<br/><br/>The Sunrise Movement is probably a good example of a progressive movement focused on climate change: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_Movement">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_Movement</a>

I am trying to imagine how someone would post a job for some far-right movement here. That would be awkward.<br/><br/>I think it would be better if politics stayed out of this community.
