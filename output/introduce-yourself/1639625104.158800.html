Hello community,<br/>I've been here before but I'll introduce myself again: I'm Rodrigo Tello, a Mexican Brooklyn-based interface designer. My original background [or academically] is in architecture but as all of you, got in love [maybe?] with computers when we were 12 making websites and pressing "view source code".<br/><br/>The part of my career that might be the most relevant to this community was that I worked at Hopscotch, a programing environment &amp; language for kids, for 5 years.<br/><br/>I have a couple of side projects at the moment, some more businessy some more exploratory/research-oriented that would be interesting to this community, I hope to share them soon.<br/>Some interests besides computing are playing guitar, synths, painting, arts in general.
