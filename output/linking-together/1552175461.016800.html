Okay guys, I am sick of being told I'm "bright" or "clever" or "smart"... just before I am turned down for a job or, in the case of what happened to me two days ago, fired.<br/><br/>I suspect that the kind of people who don't like me are the same kind of people who are unwilling to explain to my face why they don't like me. Come to think of it, I guess that's just how human culture typically works? But it hurts at lot. So when I was "laid off" (their words, but I was definitely fired), I was completely shocked. They briefly explained why, but it went over my head and I immediately forgot the words in the sentences. Something about cultural differences? About how the work environment is "chaotic" and my organized, perfectionist style was not acceptable? I sent an email yesterday morning at 3AM saying "So, respectfully, may I have the explanation repeated?" but as of yet, no response. One thing I did vaguely remember was what the company's figurehead-leader-of-the-Canadian-subsidiary (not involved in the decision) said something like "we're looking for people that put in 85% effort, and people that give 110% don't really fit in." Hmm, that's probably not exactly how it was worded, but all I can remember with certainty is the numbers 85% (describing a typical/ideal employee) and 110% (me).<br/><br/>Oh well, theoretically that should mean I can look for developer tools jobs to my heart's content... but for the moment I'm too exhausted, owing to a sudden difficulty sleeping.

Minor note: don't be surprised they don't reply to your email. In these situations it is standard procedure to put as little down in writing as possible.
