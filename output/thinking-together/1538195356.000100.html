Hi all. I was recently introduced to Steve. I see I've stumbled across some like-minded folks here (i.e. "programming can be so much better!!!"). Like many of you, I'm a gentleman scientist (<a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/independent-research">https://nadiaeghbal.com/independent-research</a>), tinkering with language ideas that I'd love to use with real work. I just scanned this channel for interesting ideas and links, have 40 tabs open, and wonder if I'll get any sleep tonight. :slightly_smiling_face: Nice to be here.

I'm so happy to hear someone else use that term. That's exactly what I've been calling myself. It seems to be a reoccurring theme here - Being tired of waiting for some existing organization to do something official and just going at it on your own. It's inspiring to see others do this. What a great time to be alive to do this. We already own all of our equipment, software and reading material as essentially free, colleagues are everyone around the world available for collaboration. And all it costs is your time.

Additionally running large computations for a small amount of time is minimally expensive on EC2, something that would have been unheard of 15 years ago.
