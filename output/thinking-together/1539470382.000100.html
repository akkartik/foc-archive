But I’m not sure where that connects to the original thought about money.<br/><br/>Going back to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Gregg Tavares</span>’s YouTube example: I think “YouTube would be 1000x better without money” triggered my response, because I think it’s very easy to make the mistake of only seeing the negative side of money, the corruption, the misguided incentives (based on making money over delivering value), and all the business-types who show up that we’d rather like to stay home. But that’s unfortunately how markets work. If there is value, people will come and try to exploit that. But it also paves the way and breaks down barriers of entry for everyone, making it possible for real value creators and those who just want to express themselves to contribute. The money amplifies or accelerates both the good and the bad parts. One comes with the other. Even if we’d only like to have the good parts.

&gt; I’m trying to wrap my head around tasks where extrinsic incentives work well according to your definition — do you have an example for what you had in mind?<br/><br/>Pretty much anything in the "old economy", the things we did for thousands of years. It's trivial to count the number of shirts a worker sews in an assembly line, and even relatively easy to perform quality control on each shirt. But knowledge work increases the degrees of freedom of each worker manyfold.<br/><br/>&gt; And if I understand you correctly, you mean that writing software does not fall into that category?<br/><br/>Yeah. The rise of open source software is a pretty strong hint here. There's something that changes when programmers can choose what they work on. Part of it is that their concerns become more long term. When it's just a job one is more inclined to take shortcuts, particularly if they won't be noticed for a few weeks or months (by which time you may have switched teams, or gotten promoted). But if it's your baby you think about it in the shower, you argue and agonize endlessly about tiny decisions. And the thousands of tiny decisions done right move the needle on externally visible quality.<br/><br/>Modern "20% time" and periodic in-company hackathons try to combine industrial organization with intrinsic motivation. You get paid, but you also get a looser leash to decide what to do. (But not <em>too</em> loose, because we don't yet know how to make it work.)<br/><br/>&gt; Going back to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Gregg Tavares</span>’s YouTube example: I think “YouTube would be 1000x better without money” triggered my response<br/><br/>At least the way I interpreted it, it was a statement of fact rather than values. When Youtube first started, the time of the original generation of Numa-numa memes (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmtzQCSh6xk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmtzQCSh6xk</a>) it was uneven but often authentic and serendipitous. When they first started paying creators things got better for a time (so no, money is not all negative), but the competition for money drew in more people who wouldn't otherwise make videos. And it brought in the A/B testers. And all that over ten years has made it a thousand times worse than before the money. Money had benefits, and yes both benefits and drawbacks magnified, but <em>in this arena</em> the drawbacks have swamped benefits.<br/><br/>Or at least that's how I see it.

I don’t know. If I buy a t-shirt, and I care about good fit, the quality, which materials were used, where it was produced, and if it was sewn by a child or not, I run into very similar trust issues you described earlier for software. It’s not a difference of “old economy” vs. knowledge work, it’s a difference of whether you care or not.<br/><br/>For software I can also just accept dubios metrics (price, number of stars on GitHub, lines of code, etc.). Or I care enough to not accept those and realize that reality is always more complex than the oversimplified metrics we use everywhere to not have to deal with reality’s complexities — and markets are such a mechanism where we let an open market figure out one such metric, price.

Knowledge work is different, because it doesn’t involve materials. The materials required to produce knowledge work cost next to nothing, because we in our comfortable western world already have all the equipment we need and can just spend time on turning thoughts into running programs.<br/><br/>Something that’s easily exploitable by businesses who are desperate to find new markets by telling employees that they can work on what they want one day a week or at a company hackathon and then had them sign agreements before that mean that every idea and product that comes out of it is intellectual property owned by the organisation. (Not saying that every 20% rule or hackathon are motivated by this, just pointing out that it’s possible.)

I don’t think a hypothetical statement about the future can be a statement of fact. It can be a hypothesis (that is hard or impossible to test), and as such I was pointing out why I think it’s not true.<br/><br/>YouTube chose a certain model to scale, and it’s the model they chose (monetizing people’s attention with ads) that incentivizes quantity over quality, and that brought all the people who don’t actually want to create value, because it’s so easy to get people’s attention with BS. It’s not money that made YouTube worse, it’s the ad-based business model monetizing viewers attention that did.<br/><br/>HBO and Netflix have a different model that at least incentivized them to produce high-quality content so people are willing to pay for a monthly subscription, because they love watching Game of Thrones or Westworld.<br/><br/>I don’t know what a good model for software could be. But if it needs to be scalable, it’ll involve money in one way or another, at least until we end up in that post-capitalism world they have in Star Trek.

It sounds like you're more anti-money then me! :joy: You're right that there are always non-monetary concerns. But with software these concerns directly affect the consumer, albeit after some delay. Hmm, arguably climate change is the same though the delay is a little greater. Not the fight I've chosen, but I'm definitely glad others care about these issues.<br/><br/>You're right that it depends on the business model. I don't claim a solution has to not involve money. I just claim that merely adding money to an existing business model isn't always going to improve things. Maybe that's our point of agreement?<br/><br/>The whole point of money has been that it made the incommensurable commensurable. If that is becoming increasingly untrue then the role of money is arguably becoming a lot less central to the economy. We need to be teaching kids and people to think more about business models and supply chains.

…and consequences and incentives. Funny, now you point it out, I might’ve come across as defending capitalism, but you are absolutely right that I am very far on the other side and would like us to rather live in a Star Trek future. I just don’t think we can get there with blindly trusting idealism and by ignoring how the world works today.

Since you brought up a scifi metaphors, and since the metaphors we use have a powerful effect on our desires and goals, I'll throw out a couple of scifi metaphors that have influenced me for years. Not pushing back on anything you said, just a <em>non sequitur</em> in hopes of continuing the conversation.<br/><br/>a) While our hopes for the future tend to look like the <em>Enterprise</em>, all gleaming chrome and clean interfaces, I now hanker after something more like the <em>Serenity</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQtdfh2Uxoo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQtdfh2Uxoo</a>), all the wires and ductwork hanging out. While it's not as nice to look at, it seems far more hackable and democratic. Habitable. (<a href="http://akkartik.name/post/habitability">http://akkartik.name/post/habitability</a>)<br/><br/>b) Asimov's Second Foundation, as a sort of less tangible counterweight to the tangible technological advancement of the First Foundation. The First Foundation was technologically advanced like the Star Trek universe, but people were still recognizably people in their ethical and cognitive limitations. The Second Foundation was Asimov's attempt to envision a world of <em>better</em> people. While he got the details understandably wrong (there's no reason to believe telepathy will make people better), I think there's something to the idea of changing ourselves to improve the efficacy of our tools. The change I imagine is to incentives. People already have huge incentives to not be anti-social, but only locally so. I'd like to live in a world where just as much attention goes to <em>global</em> consequences of behavior. This is a technology problem too, but the solution will look very different from our usual examples of technology. It may well end up being as simple as a checklist.
