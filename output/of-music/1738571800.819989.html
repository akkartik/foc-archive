See Jacob Collier play with Google's MusicFX DJ.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/IUQW5LgBZvQ">https://www.youtube.com/live/IUQW5LgBZvQ</a>  He basically uses MusicFX as a sort of silly sampler.  It's a more interesting use than whole-cloth generation.  This is what he comes up with in about two hours <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/IUQW5LgBZvQ?si=neSJnd8eUKZU8cNh&amp;t=6047">https://www.youtube.com/live/IUQW5LgBZvQ?si=neSJnd8eUKZU8cNh&amp;t=6047</a>. Now that I notice a Transcript button on the YouTube page, I should be able to pull out some interesting quotes without undue effort (ordered thematically):<br/>&gt; 	Let's see if we can mine some from the depths of the unknown brain... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/IUQW5LgBZvQ?si=khhFJ02r2gdXMtDl&amp;t=1462">https://www.youtube.com/live/IUQW5LgBZvQ?si=khhFJ02r2gdXMtDl&amp;t=1462</a>.<br/>&gt; 	Do you ever just find everything's infinite? Do you ever find that everything contains infinite potential? [Welcome to exploring a latent space] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/IUQW5LgBZvQ?si=VlVQNoVItFhBgnZS&amp;t=5928">https://www.youtube.com/live/IUQW5LgBZvQ?si=VlVQNoVItFhBgnZS&amp;t=5928</a>.<br/>&gt; 	Okay I have a plan. Just kidding I don't have a plan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/IUQW5LgBZvQ?si=yXDHDA8uGSUSBAfX&amp;t=4995">https://www.youtube.com/live/IUQW5LgBZvQ?si=yXDHDA8uGSUSBAfX&amp;t=4995</a>.<br/>&gt; 	The moment everything starts to be really realistic it's just not interesting... So many things like this that I've tried are designed to directly imitate things: it's like do this exact thing like this person would. But the thing I love about this is that it's yeah it's designed to not do that. It's designed to be strange, and it's just fun <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/IUQW5LgBZvQ?si=SVpsAXq8P-VUA47y&amp;t=3306">https://www.youtube.com/live/IUQW5LgBZvQ?si=SVpsAXq8P-VUA47y&amp;t=3306</a>.<br/>&gt; 	You, the person, get to apply your own taste to it because the AI doesn't have a point of view like that. It doesn't have taste. You have taste, but you can still use all these materials to make your thing more interesting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/IUQW5LgBZvQ?si=TeZxailbomhdNN0N&amp;t=5588">https://www.youtube.com/live/IUQW5LgBZvQ?si=TeZxailbomhdNN0N&amp;t=5588</a>.

Didn't watch the whole thing, but this was delightful. It's always so fun to see Jacob Collier work, and I like his approach to using genAI here. I'm on the fence about this technology because I think replacing artists is a dumb idea. This gives a good counter-example, of how an artist can use genAI in a way that doesn't really take away from their authorship and agency :thinking_face:

Yeah, my whole point is that a lot of these generative AI demos are cute but miss the point for the very detailed things that artists really want to do.  For example, Collier just got a Grammy for his "Bridge Over Troubled Water" arrangement in which he uses "AI" to clean up one of the vocalists.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/I8DWlis-MEY?si=RM643MGYEwGrJVdy&amp;t=970">https://www.youtube.com/live/I8DWlis-MEY?si=RM643MGYEwGrJVdy&amp;t=970</a>

Thinking of a friend, does lighting for digital effects, whose studio invested a lot of time and effort building final pass denoiser to fix artifacts that come up mostly from floating point rounding during raytracing.  I had the impression that it's a diffusion model very much like all those text-to-image generators and upscalers.
