I’m Gustav and I’ve been working in the developer tooling\/productivity space for a few years now, previously at a large fintech for a few years and now I’m a co-founder of a YC company in the same space. I’ve been working a lot with monorepos and compiler toolchains in Bazel, and have been building a lot of tools to get 100s of developers to work better and faster together. On my spare time I’m building compilers, static code analysers, and running quite a lot. It’s nice to meet you all! :smiley:",
