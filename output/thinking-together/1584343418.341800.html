Everything about my project, in one place: <a href="http://akkartik.name/akkartik-convivial-20200315.pdf">http://akkartik.name/akkartik-convivial-20200315.pdf</a> (pdf; 25 pages)<br/><br/>(Well, two places. This paper and the repo at <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">https://github.com/akkartik/mu</a> should subsume any previous writings.)<br/><br/>&gt; <b>Bicycles for the mind have to be see-through</b><br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; This paper describes ongoing research on building software to be comprehensible to its users so that they can tailor it to their needs in the field. Our test-bed is a computing stack called Mu that deemphasizes a clean interface in favor of a few global implementation properties: small implementation size, few distinct notations, parsimonious dependencies, a simple dependency graph that avoids cycles, and early warning on breaking changes. Assuming a 32-bit x86 processor and (for now) a basic third-party Unix-like kernel, Mu builds up from raw machine code to a memory-safe but less expressive language than C.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Our approach to keeping software comprehensible is to reduce information hiding and abstraction, and instead encourage curiosity about internals. Our hypothesis is that abstractions help insiders who understand a project but hinder newcomers who understand only that project's domain. Where recent efforts to create <tt></tt>bicycles for the mind'' have tended to focus on reducing learning time and effort, we explore organizing the curriculum to be incrementally useful, providing an hour of actionable value for an hour (or three) of study. The hope is that rewarding curiosity will stimulate curiosity in a virtuous cycle, so that more people are motivated to study and reflect on the difference between good vs bad design and good vs bad architecture, even as the study takes place over a lifetime of specialization in other domains. Spreading expertise in design is essential to the creation of a better society of more empowered citizens. Software tools have a role to play in this process, both by exemplifying good design and by providing visceral illustrations of the consequences of design choices.<br/>I hope to eventually do a talk for <a href="https://2020.programming-conference.org/home/salon-2020">https://2020.programming-conference.org/home/salon-2020</a>, but since it's been postponed the paper I wrote has been burning a hole in my pocket. Many thanks to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span> and the rest of the organizers for an inspiring theme this year. I didn't think anything would ever induce me to write an academic paper again.

My favorite comment there:<br/><br/>&gt; Morty: Aw, geez, Rick, don't you think we ought to abstract away the low-level details here?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Rick: Listen, Morty. Just <em>bburpecause</em> you wrap something in an abstraction doesn't mean the complexity "goes away". It just means you've put off dealing with it -- usually until it fails. And when it does fail, you now have another layer of shit to dig through to find the root cause. Walk into the fire, Morty. Embrace the suck. And think about how you will handle error conditions before you write the happy path.<br/>:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22599953#22601623">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22599953#22601623</a> goes on my HN favorites (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/favorites?id=akkartik&amp;comments=t">https://news.ycombinator.com/favorites?id=akkartik&amp;comments=t</a>)

&gt; Our key pillars are dependency injection and fakes. For example, printing to screen shouldn’t be written as: print(“hello”) It should be written: print(REAL_SCREEN, “hello”)<br/>It should be both! Dependencies should be either injected like that or deduced from the environment itself - both is optimal.<br/><br/>So it should be (using names before blocks as “enviroment with this dependency runs the block”<br/><br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">RealScreen {<br/>  print("hello")<br/>} <br/>(which also means it should be)<br/><br/>"Hello" {<br/>  print(REAL_SCREEN)<br/>}</pre><br/><br/><br/>Traces are a great idea for a ground-up feature of the stack and so are blocks for easier allocation, can’t wait to see the high level language you come up with for this.
