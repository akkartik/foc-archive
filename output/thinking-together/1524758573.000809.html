I wasn't judging when I used the word "hack"! In fact, if I was judging, I'd point out the positive aspect of applying creativity to find a new use case for something that was built with a different use case in mind. For me that is the original definition of what "hack" means, before movie culture turned it into this "bad actor is breaking the rules and causing trouble" definition.<br/><br/>So I guess the difference between "hack" and "technique" for me is pretty small. Maybe a technique is a hack that is broadly accepted as a valid way of doing things, while a hack can be every creative repurposing of something, which sometimes isn't necessary useful, but instead has other qualities, like being surprising, impressive, or just fun.<br/><br/>The point being: you are using a tool that allows creative repurposing. Many simple apps these days are so sophisticated that they can only be used for one specific use case, and repurposing them for anything else is just too hard to do or doesn't yield any benefits for the user.<br/><br/>It seems to me that a lot of creative domains have settled on well-known tools that are specific enough to be easily understood and yet generic enough to allow creative repurposing.<br/><br/>Every image editing software has certain tools that are expected. By composing them (for instance in using them on the same artwork in a certain order) users can create infinite amounts of different results with them. Same with video editing or 3D modeling or music production.<br/><br/>I'm not an expert in any of these domains. With my basic understanding of music production I see the same patterns there: There are certain well-understood tools (e.g. sound sources based on additive or subtractive synthesis or sample playback) with well-defined parameters (e.g. ADSR curves) and well-established UI/UX patterns (e.g. placing MIDI notes on a grid or scrubbing through a waveform representation of a sample) composable in sequence or in parallel to generate more complex sounds, aka music.
