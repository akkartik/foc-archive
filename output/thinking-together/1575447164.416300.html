I think the idea that interfaces should be invisible is an outcome from the philosophy that making things is about transmitting ideas into the world. Therefore interfaces should be as seamless as possible, only existing to channel the genius of the creator.<br/>If you instead think that making things is about <em>following</em> ideas through feedback with material to see where they go, then interfaces should be interesting and characterful.
