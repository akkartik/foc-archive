Nintendo was the first company to select ARM chips for a portable gaming unit. They made the Nintendo GameBoy Run for 20 hours on a single AA battery, that was a really good design. that’s a lot of playtime. But when you have 40 independent battery powered pieces the chance that one of them is running low becomes very high and therefore you’re constantly interrupted by charging.\n\nNintendo got really rich because they understood electronic child immobilization was an extremely valuable thing for parents.
