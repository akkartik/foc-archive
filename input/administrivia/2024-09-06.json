The fact that there's no aggregation means you can basically assume nobody will see what you post there. But you can go back and link to something if it becomes relevant. This feels like it better captures the Christopher-Alexander ethos of #garage-door-open that we also alluded to in that thread.\n\nIn 2024 I spent a certain amount of effort creating a devlog for myself on my own site. But it still feels like a site and so something more heavy. A chat might work better as a lab notebook. I'm not sure chat would work for me, it doesn't feel natural. But perhaps this is something to think about in our Next Forum™.",

But you can go back and link to something if it becomes relevant. This feels like it better captures the Christopher-Alexander ethos of #garage-door-open that we also alluded to in that thread.\n\nIn 2024 I spent a certain amount of effort creating a devlog for myself on my own site. But it still feels like a site and so something more heavy. A chat might work better as a lab notebook. I'm not sure chat would work for me, it doesn't feel natural. But perhaps this is something to think about in our Next Forum™."
