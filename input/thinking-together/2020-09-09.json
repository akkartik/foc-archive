SQL is learnable by pretty much anyone IMO (my mom struggled with Java and Python but is better at SQL than me!). Getting analysts to learn Python is a big ask and people worry about mistakes that could be make (plus that type of code is harder to audit). Also, I’ll throw in obligatory popularity of Excel here! You still got the ML in Python people but most analysts and less technical people don’t necessarily want Python \/ R right away.\n• *Note taking \/ personal organization.* There’s a subset of note-taking (2nd brain, Roam, Digital Garden etc) who are interested in adapting their current tools even more to their personal workflows &amp; preferences and don’t mind simple scripting.

You still got the ML in Python people but most analysts and less technical people don’t necessarily want Python \/ R right away."

There’s a pessimistic and an optimistic view, but the nature of the change of revolutions seems to be about the niches that adopt these ideas.\n\nThe good thing with some of the areas I listed above is that I feel \/ think that those end-users are a bit more patient. They want to do more with less and they’re willing to try tools that are different but can enhance their workflow.\n\nThere’s still the “integration with existing tools \/ workflow” problem though. The data science one is that ultimately any fancy EUP tooling still has to talk to a clunky big database. With art, people expect similar formats as the output (SVG, PNG, MP4, etc)."

My ideal society of people educated in programming may not involve most people actually doing much programming most days. What matters is the _potential_. Compounding advantages from programming for one day per year.\n\n* Impulse to generalize is self-limiting (some maintenance burden may be irreducible). A good end-user computer needs to be extremely parsimonious in out-of-the-box capabilities, and leave lots of space for users to \"pollute\" it with what they care about.
