I think the company who is best positioned, in the short-term, to release transformative hardware is Apple. However their track record for building supportive business models to developers is not strong (outside of games, bigtech). I hope this will change. Potentially the web itself could be a valve for this pressure without requiring the company to change (like Windows back in the 90s)\n• Illich is definitely on my syllabus. I am tangentially familiar with some of his work via LM Sacasas’ newsletter <https:\/\/theconvivialsociety.substack.com\/|The Convivial Society>\n• Your work on see-through bicycles for the mind really resonates with me. I will have to go through the paper in more depth, but increasing legibility\/comprehensibility is definitely key. <https:\/\/maggieappleton.com\/drawinginvisibles1|Maggie Appleton>’s work on visualising programming concepts has been very inspiring to me here as well\nVery much appreciate you taking the time to read the blog post :slightly_smiling_face:",
