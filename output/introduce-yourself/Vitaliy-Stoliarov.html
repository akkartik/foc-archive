Hello! I am a frontend developer from Kharkiv (Ukraine). I contribute to open source projects and work on my own framework called Rete.js. <a href="http://rete.js.org">http://rete.js.org</a><br/><br/>I started learning programming more than 5 years ago, studied languages ​​ PHP -&gt; JS -&gt; C++ -&gt; C# -&gt; Java -&gt; ES6/TS. Now basically I programming on JavaScript.<br/><br/>At the moment I see the benefit for myself in languages ​​such as JS/TS and C++, but one of the problems still remains - writing the code. Perhaps someone will argue that you need to have a good knowledge  of programming language. I agree, good knowledge will allow you to write quality code, but there are problems with reading someone else's code that is written in a different style (or has poor quality).<br/><br/>Being inspired by UE4, Substance Designer and Plant factory I decided to write my own library for creating such editors in the browser (dataflow programming). At that time (as now) I didn’t find a universal and customizable framework/library. I have started writing a library called D3-Node-Editor (March, 2017) and after a year of development I revised many approaches and rewrote it to the new architecture and called Rete.js. <a href="https://github.com/retejs/rete">https://github.com/retejs/rete</a><br/><br/>Are there somebody who have experience in Dataflow programming and know the current unsolved problems? I'm going to postgraduate studies to working with dataflow and my framework, but my scientific director (I hope I correctly translated to english phrase "научный руководитель") says that a dissertation must contains scientific novelty, and framework is only a tool. So I am not sure whether to continue studying at the university in order to do this, since among professors no one has much experience with visual programming.
