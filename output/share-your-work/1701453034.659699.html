We just published a new demo of Plato's PBD subsystem. Much more powerful than our previous implementation.<br/><br/>PBD is historically difficult to generalize and make practical, but it seems that once you take it out of the desktop metaphor and apply it to relational data where queries are more explicit, it does quite well.<br/><br/>I suspect this could become the most prevalent way of automating app logic without coding.
