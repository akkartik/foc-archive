I love experimental programming language design and compiler theory. I'm heavily involved in the nim-lang community, my niche language of choice. Where I differ from the mainstream is that I am not a fan of the modern web. I'm a big fan of Jonathan Blow, Casey Muratori, the \"handmade\" movement, and the ideas of \"mechanical sympathy\". I favor returning to native apps over web technologies everywhere. I feel like I'm a weirdo for being interested in both \"the future of code\" and also interested in low level computer optimization, but I believe it's possible to have the best of both worlds (at least that's my dream)! I am more about \"raising the ceiling\" than \"lowering the floor\" of programming. I come down firmly on the belief that computers are like a musical instrument, and we don't need to dumb them down (and slow them down) with an ever growing pile of abstractions, we instead need to provide a structured ladder of abstractions that can enable more expression. I will probably spend most of my time lurking, but I'm excited to be here and see what everyone is working on!",

I'm a big fan of Bret Victor (like many here I'm sure). I love experimental programming language design and compiler theory. I'm heavily involved in the nim-lang community, my niche language of choice. Where I differ from the mainstream is that I am not a fan of the modern web. I'm a big fan of Jonathan Blow, Casey Muratori, the \"handmade\" movement, and the ideas of \"mechanical sympathy\". I favor returning to native apps over web technologies everywhere. I feel like I'm a weirdo for being interested in both \"the future of code\" and also interested in low level computer optimization, but I believe it's possible to have the best of both worlds (at least that's my dream)! I am more about \"raising the ceiling\" than \"lowering the floor\" of programming. I come down firmly on the belief that computers are like a musical instrument, and we don't need to dumb them down (and slow them down) with an ever growing pile of abstractions, we instead need to provide a structured ladder of abstractions that can enable more expression. I will probably spend most of my time lurking, but I'm excited to be here and see what everyone is working on!"
