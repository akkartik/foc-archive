I’ve been dreaming of making some sort of “ultimate programming language” for over 15 years—but to my surprise, never found any like-minded folks until recently. I registered <a href="http://loyc.net/">http://loyc.net/</a> in 2007 with the idea of making a democratically-extensible compiler with multiple input syntaxes; as time passed it morphed into a set of general ideas for language building. More concretely I wrote the C# parser generator LLLPG and the Lisp-inspired macro system it runs within (it's designed so that the same macro system could support any programming language, I just haven't had time to go beyond C#). But for this group the most relevant thing I've made is LESv2 and LESv3, two simple languages to represent universal syntax trees. I've worked a bit with Jonathan Van der Cruise who made Flame, a compiler-building framework for C#. I learned about Haxe just this year, but I've wanted to build something for several years that would let you write libraries targeting several languages at once. I think I could build something better than Haxe and Cito (Ć) - if only I had some funding and manpower. I’d also be interested in a system for bridging programming languages at run-time so they could communicate seamlessly. For now, I’m too busy at my new job to do anything, including hang out here! (truth be told it's a horrible job and I desperately wish to find something better.) I’ve been bursting with ideas for years and hate being unable to execute on them.<br/><br/>Links:<br/>• Loyc trees <a href="http://loyc.net/loyc-trees">http://loyc.net/loyc-trees</a><br/>• LES <a href="http://loyc.net/les">http://loyc.net/les</a> &lt;= Use this to prototype new programming languages<br/>• LLLPG <a href="http://ecsharp.net/lllpg">http://ecsharp.net/lllpg</a><br/>• LeMP <a href="http://ecsharp.net/lemp">http://ecsharp.net/lemp</a><br/>• Flame <a href="https://github.com/jonathanvdc/Flame">https://github.com/jonathanvdc/Flame</a><br/>• Haxe <a href="https://haxe.org">https://haxe.org</a>

I strongly suggest you drop the # character in front of keywords. The # character is not  a quickly typed character, and from an ergonomic standpoint, the only high frequency characters in your language should be located near the home row. There are 8 or so punctuation characters near the home row you can use instead.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@magicmouse94937</span>, <tt>#</tt> is not intended to be a high-frequency character for humans - it might appear a lot in machine-generated code, but human-written code would use<br/>1. macros,<br/>2. LESv3 code, where you often use <tt>.</tt> instead of <tt>#</tt> as a "C-like statement marker" - the parser translates it to <tt>#</tt> - or<br/>3. languages such as Enhanced C# that use conventional keywords that are secretly translated to <tt>#</tt> internally.<br/><br/>I think I chose <tt>#</tt> as a specialness marker because most languages <em>don't</em> allow it in normal identifiers and don't use it as an operator either. I didn't want to step on existing toes.

well for that purpose # is a great marker, because it really does stand out well in a stream of characters. The @ also is very noticeable. Most of the other punctuation characters are thin and disappear slightly like ~ ^ | . I was just worried about the frequency of that character in your stream.
