<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tim Babb</span> It took me a long time to realize this. I had assumed everyone preferred simplicity until, in my first job out of school, I was assigned to help someone create a UI for their project. I didn’t understand why we kept arguing over every little thing until I asked him why he insisted on something and he said (paraphrasing) “The way you’re suggesting wouldn’t look as impressive.” and I realized his goal was to impress users, not help them. Suddenly, all the mystifyingly unnecessary complexity in design and function in the world had an explanation.
