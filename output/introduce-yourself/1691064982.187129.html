Hi folks, I’m prabhanshu from Bangalore. I’ve been researching spreadsheets and how they enable end user programming for some time now. I came across this Slack from <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Maggie Appleton</span>’s work. I’ve found a lot of useful ideas here. Much thanks to everyone who’s put this community together.<br/><br/>I’ve recently started building a “spreadsheet playground” with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ravi Chandra Padmala</span> where we’re thinking about the spreadsheet medium from the ground up. The idea is to acknowledge and improve spreadsheets as an environment for building small information systems. We’re looking at patterns from the programming/software-building world we can apply to simplify them a bit and make it easy to make reliable and maintainable spreadsheets.<br/><br/>My background is in software building and we want to work with folks who have experience in HCI/PL/notation design. I’d love to talk if any of it sounds interesting :)
