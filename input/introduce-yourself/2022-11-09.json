My website is <https:\/\/nilfm.cc>\n\nMy recent projects include a modular CMS (modular in that it can accept multiple adapters around the headless SSG doing the page generation, although right now only one adapter is implemented - <https:\/\/nilfm.cc\/nirvash.html)>, a simple slippy map annotation tool (<https:\/\/nilfm.cc\/onyx.html>), and I'm currently working on a lightweight virtual tabletop for remote D&amp;D. I'm also into the uxn ecosystem, having developed the xrxs experimental uxn game server (<https:\/\/nilfm.cc\/xrxs.html>) and worked on a couple other uxn-adjacent projects.
