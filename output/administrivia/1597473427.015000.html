<b>Welcome to #administrivia!</b><br/><br/>This is the channel for discussion about the community itself. If you'd like to propose a channel, report a violation of the code of conduct, ask a question about how we do things, or propose a new community initiative, this is the place.<br/><br/>• If you'd like to discuss something sensitive, please send me DM<br/>• It's not expected that everyone join this channel. If you have something important to announce and everyone should see it, please use #announcements — but that channel is the loudest megaphone we have, so please be conservative about how you use it. If in doubt, ask me first.
