Of course its a complex Issue But lets take the STEPS project as an example: Here is the HN discussion thread about that report: Interview with Adele goldberg\n<https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=11686325>\nI commented there with the user \"notusinglinux\" , I basically argue that to little effort was made to make the source of the project available, even if they didn't believe people would understand it. And IF they thought people would not understand it, why not create some kind of educational effort where to explore these ideas with a larger community? A MOOC or something related?",
