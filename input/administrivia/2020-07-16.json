        "text": "I have banned Edward from the community. He received a final warning, and directly counteracted it. He knows that I am sharing this news here (edit: and gave me permission to do so).\n\nSince I took over as steward last winter, I've received about a dozen complaints from different people about him, including two in the past week. He's the only person I've ever received these sorts of complaints about. The nature of the complaints varied, but in general people felt that he was exceedingly negative, and insensitive to the ideas of others here. That's not sufficient grounds to be banned, but it is certainly not in line with the supportive, welcoming, collaborative spirit that our community should foster. I also received complaints about the way he discussed the issue of gender diversity. Again, not grounds to be banned, but a big red flag.\n\nAs early as February, I tried to work with him in an attempt to help him be a more positive presence here. I've spent hours discussing with him, in public and private, how his behaviour here made people feel unwelcome, and how some of the things he said were unacceptably regressive. I tried to work with him, at first (months ago) asking him to be more careful when he talks about women in tech, and more recently asking him to change messages or avoid certain subjects. He has not once shown any kind of acknowledgment of the substance of my concerns. When I made specific requests, he ignored them, or responded with counter-accusations, pettiness, disrespect, or distraction (in ways that I won't detail, out of respect for his privacy). After yet another person messaged me today saying he made them want to leave the community, I issued a final warning to Edward: stop posting entirely, and just lurk, or else you will be banned. He ignored that as well, and continued posting.\n\nPlease feel free to discuss this action in the thread for this message, or to DM me about this. I've talked with a lot of you about Edward already in various capacities, so I'm sure this doesn't come as a surprise. Still, I would love to learn from this and avoid ending up in this situation ever again.",

He knows that I am sharing this news here (edit: and gave me permission to do so).\n\nSince I took over as steward last winter, I've received about a dozen complaints from different people about him, including two in the past week. He's the only person I've ever received these sorts of complaints about. The nature of the complaints varied, but in general people felt that he was exceedingly negative, and insensitive to the ideas of others here. That's not sufficient grounds to be banned, but it is certainly not in line with the supportive, welcoming, collaborative spirit that our community should foster. I also received complaints about the way he discussed the issue of gender diversity. Again, not grounds to be banned, but a big red flag.\n\nAs early as February, I tried to work with him in an attempt to help him be a more positive presence here. I've spent hours discussing with him, in public and private, how his behaviour here made people feel unwelcome, and how some of the things he said were unacceptably regressive. I tried to work with him, at first (months ago) asking him to be more careful when he talks about women in tech, and more recently asking him to change messages or avoid certain subjects. He has not once shown any kind of acknowledgment of the substance of my concerns. When I made specific requests, he ignored them, or responded with counter-accusations, pettiness, disrespect, or distraction (in ways that I won't detail, out of respect for his privacy). After yet another person messaged me today saying he made them want to leave the community, I issued a final warning to Edward: stop posting entirely, and just lurk, or else you will be banned. He ignored that as well, and continued posting.\n\nPlease feel free to discuss this action in the thread for this message, or to DM me about this. I've talked with a lot of you about Edward already in various capacities, so I'm sure this doesn't come as a surprise. Still, I would love to learn from this and avoid ending up in this situation ever again."

If memory serves, there were two or three other threads that either started out with, or were turned into, folks talking to Edward about his behaviour here. He most certainly was ignoring the community around him, again and again, which is why I'm banning him. If he had shown willingness to even acknowledge the concerns of others around him, rather than refusing at every turn, we'd be in a very different situation.",

(Also, note the very last sentence in my original post for that thread, asking what should be done if the offender doesn't respond to gentle reinforcement \/ requests.) If memory serves, there were two or three other threads that either started out with, or were turned into, folks talking to Edward about his behaviour here. He most certainly was ignoring the community around him, again and again, which is why I'm banning him. If he had shown willingness to even acknowledge the concerns of others around him, rather than refusing at every turn, we'd be in a very different situation."
