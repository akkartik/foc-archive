Hi! I'm an interaction designer/creative tech/specialized generalist/educator/artist (depending on who you ask and when). I initially got into writing code as a means for creating interactive art. Later, while trying to do tangible &amp; embodied interface research, I realised that our research artefacts were so bad and janky that I had no confidence in any of the results. So I learned to build better ones, which included a lot of programming. This made me pretty popular as a prototyper in our group of labs, so I got a lot of practice. Later (again) I learned more code for interactive art (again), and most recently I've been building sensors/equipment, analysis tools &amp; interfaces, and prototypes for environmental monitoring (emission location and quantification). I learned on java and now mostly use c++ and javascript/typescript. Sometimes python if I really have to.<br/><br/>I stumbled across this community on <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span>'s LinkedIn profile haha and am glad to have found it! I'm only surprised I didn't join sooner.<br/><br/>Regarding computer futurism - I've been dancing around the ideas of embodied interaction, tangible interfaces, and sensor-network-interfaces / distributed systems for a number of years. My experience in these fields mostly lies around fun and education. For example, using tangible interfaces to effectively increase cognitive bandwidth for learning by avoiding overloading the already saturated cognitive pathway occupied by sight and sound (touch uses different pathways). Or exploring how we might use (or recognize and avoid) embodied metaphors in computational systems as a tool of influence in persuasive gaming. Or how we might help others to understand and empathize with other cultures through embodied values and tangible artefacts.<br/><br/>In the very near future I'm working on some fun things with blinky lights and simple interactions to be fun and silly and delightful. If anyone in AB/Edmonton is doing that kind of stuff, reach out! Here are some of my projects that might give you an idea of what I do: <a href="https://brendanmatkin.com/">https://brendanmatkin.com/</a>
