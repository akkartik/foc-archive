Macros are used extensively in assembler, and with enough macros Microsoft Assembler can look a lot like a higher level language. But macros make debugging much harder, because now you can't step through your source code, but instead have to step through the generated source code, and thus you now have a second form of your source code (the output of the pre-processor) to consider. The other drawback of highly nested macros is that your source code size could explode geometrically. It all depends on how deeply nested the macros get.
