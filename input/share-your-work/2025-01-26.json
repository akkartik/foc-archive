A plain file system without links has a well-established representation as a tree. You can choose to represent directories are hyper-edges between files, but unless you add links (which let you add any file to any hyper-edge), you don't gain much from that. Inversely, if your use case profits from hypergraphs, the question is if implementing this hypergraph as a tree plus links is the best concrete representation.",
