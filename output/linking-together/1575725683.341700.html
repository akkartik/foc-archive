What if you’d try to interpret the two famous quotes by Alan Kay “The best way to predict the future is to invent it” and William Gibson “The future is already here, just not evenly distributed” literally instead of figuratively?<br/><a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/inventing-time">https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/inventing-time</a>

Very interesting! The feelings aspect sounds a lot like Christopher Alexander's stuff: "The objects which are the most profound, <em>functionally</em>, are the ones which evoke the greatest feeling in us."

Alan Kay as a formative member of the amazing Xerox Palo Alto Research Center has a great place in history, as they created most of what the computer industry took the next 50 years to commercialize. But his statement that "it is easier to invent the future than predict it", is completely untrue. Bret Victor's work showed prototypes of a future programming interface that is proving extremely difficult to invent. I have little doubt that future programming interfaces will be much more "live" and interactive. Fairly easy to mock-up isolated examples, but extremely difficult to build in practice on larger real projects. Another great counter-example are the written works of Jules Verne. He predicted the future so accurately, and so far in advance, that his novels were not accepted by his publisher as fiction, but were considered wild fantasies and therefore only suitable for children. He predicted ecoterrorism, radar, television, rays of unusual qualities, aerial combat, and probably 100 more things that actually happened, that were many decades ahead of their invention.

Alan Kay has an interesting perspective on what he calls “slogans” he “had to come up with at Xerox PARC” — spoiler: it has little to do with truth; skip to time code 41:22 in this interview:<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhOHn9TClXY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhOHn9TClXY</a>
