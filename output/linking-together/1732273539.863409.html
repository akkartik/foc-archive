<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span> I haven't watched this yet, but the words you use are tickling my neurons.<br/><br/>1. "rewriting"<br/>• makes me think that this may be incredibly similar to my <em>t2t</em> ("text to text" rewriting)<br/>2.  "a rewriting system for nearly-plain-language"<br/>• makes me think of Steve Phillips' work with ChatGPT / Claude. He used LLMs to generate OhmJS. The generated OhmJS implemented his new programming language by using Golang as an assembler. It mapped his new language into legal Go code that he would run. I.e. new-lang -&gt; new-age assembler -&gt; executable, where new-age assembler == Go. (Private communication, details available, the only blocker is writing this up in a readable manner) <br/>• I'm currently using Python as an assembler in defining an HHLL and am compiling a 1,400 LOC HHLL program (into Python [done] and am working on generating Common Lisp, with an eye on generating JS).<br/>• Kinopio to markdown. I use the Kinopio app as a mind mapping / bubble-charting / brainstorming device. I invoke a Prolog program to rearrange the mind map in hierarchical order and to spit out the points as markdown (.md). I told ChatGPT to turn the point-form .md file into full-blown prose and generated at least one blog post in English that way.<br/>(Details and repos available, if interested).

1. Yes, your t2t stuff is a variant of rewriting.<br/>2. The author (Wryl) would probably not approve of LLM-based methods, given his focus on simplicity and low-resource computing. His language uses statements in simplified and restricted English. Similar to the language used in text adventure games.

Right, found it. But... let me rant a bit: I <em>hate</em> this "everyone picks their pronoun" business. Not that I have political or philosophical objections, it sounds just fine. But in practice: how am I supposed to figure out someone's preferred pronouns? Some put them on their home page, others in their Mastodon profile, etc. In a conversation, am I supposed to stop, take out my phone, and do five minutes of search before I continue my sentence?<br/>Language is a collective property of its speaker community, so pronoun choice needs to follow agreed-on rules in that community. For nothing other than pragmatic reasons.

I didn't mean to police, was just offering information. In this case I actually made the same mistake a couple of months and got corrected. Hmm, I did get corrected in private, though. That was thoughtless of me, sorry..<br/><br/>I think of it as simple courtesy. Calling people as they would like to be called. Like, I've known two Andrews in my life who hated being called 'Andy'. But yes it's hard in this decentered world of ours to keep track of this stuff. I try to do my best and otherwise not think about it too much when I make a mistake..

I am also happy to call people as they would like to be called, but I can manage that only for a small number of people I am in contact with regularly. And pronouns are worse (from a memorization point of view) than names, because names are relatively unique, whereas for pronouns, everyone picks one of a small number of combinations.
