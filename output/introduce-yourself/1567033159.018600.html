Hi all, I am engineer in industry for a while, but lately I am getting more involved in research as well and trying to find the right blend for myself. My main communities these days are Mozilla, LLVM, and Matrix. I recently moved from Chicago to London.<br/><br/>I believe mainstream computing has failed to deliver on many of the ways it could be empowering everyone in society (not just specialist programmers) and enabling communities to create and share specialised solutions to long-tail problems that improve their daily lives. I am exploring various approaches to restore some of the magic that's been lost. More thoughts on my blog: <a href="https://convolv.es/blog/now.html">https://convolv.es/blog/now.html</a>
