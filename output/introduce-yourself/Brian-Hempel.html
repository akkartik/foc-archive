Hi, I’m Brian. I’m a grad student working on Sketch-n-Sketch, a bimodal program editor that allows the programmer to edit their plain-text code <em>or</em> to directly manipulate the program’s output and thereby trigger appropriate program updates. Our main target domain is programs that draw SVGs, because for manipulating graphical shapes there’s already a kind of “standard” mouse UI—think Inkscape or PowerPoint or Illustrator—and a first goal was to imitate the basic interactions of such a regular vector graphics editor, although using plain-text code as the underlying representation of the drawing rather than some hidden graphics-specific internal data structure. More broadly the goal is to figure out reasonable ways to back-propagate manipulations on the output into code transformations, and even more broadly the theme is exploring ways to add more direct manipulation interactions to the programming workflow (e.g. mouse manipulations on code as well as on output). Many of the techniques are not specific to SVG and we are looking at alternative domains.
