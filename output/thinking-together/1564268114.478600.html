I'll add to that: Steve, you originally never planned on a lot this (podcast, slack, community), but here we are now, and it's a great opportunity for you and everyone else involved. It seems you're probably not about promoting yourself so much as you are for promoting / furthering the kind of future many of us are pushing for.<br/><br/>But you are in some sense at the center of getting/keeping that going, and drawing connections between big players in this space and making that accessible to everyone.<br/><br/>What's your perspective on the role you're playing in the community / in this space? If you had it your way, where do you see it all going? If you were to have a more support (whatever that may mean), do you see yourself in a privileged position to influence the community / this space?

Here's one thing that could happen that might qualify as "more support":<br/><br/><a href="1564268036.477400.html#1564278934.009000">1.564278.html&hellip;</a>

That was a fun conversation to read through! Thanks for the thought provoking questions. I do have thoughts here, but am mostly off the grid this week so I will let them percolate a bit more and get back to this convo early next week when I have time to sit down and write them...

Let me just say thanks again for all the positivitiy in these threads. It means the world to me.<br/><br/>As far as how I see my role in this community, I see myself as a very efficient lighthouse: attracting people to a single place to find other people, for collaboration, link sharing, feedback, etc. What I like about this role is that it doesn't take that much time or money, but it can help make some really valuable connections.<br/><br/>For this Slack, I see myself as tending to a garden. I don't know why it works as well as it does, so I don't want to disturb it too much. While I personally don't like Slack, I am suspicious that this group works precisely because of the parts of Slack I like least: its unstructured chatiness. So I want to let this Slack be what it wants to be, with subtle pushes towards positive directions when necessary. Maybe that's too idealistic or just justifying my laziness...<br/><br/>All that said, I am really bullish on this broader community and school of thought and agree that community building here may be one of the most valuable things anyone can do. While I am happy with my current minimal level of community building activities (I still want to do research), I really welcome the help and energy of others here, and would gladly support other (even competing) efforts. I'd love to brainstorm ideas with anyone in this direction: piloting a new community in a platform better suited than Slack, setting up more online meetups or conferences, planning an in-person conference or meetup, setting up a "journal", etc. I've done brainstorming along these lines with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Aidan Cunniffe</span> and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span>.<br/><br/>(There is a small voice in my head that whispers that I should drop my own research and do community organizing full time, but I am telling it to be quiet because I am excited  about my own research at the moment. Maybe I will listen to it another day. I have fantasies of being a modern day Licklider,  going around giving out grants to people like us, but we'd gotta find the money somehow. I also dream of a FoC in-person conference, but that seems like a TON of work. I don't really want to be a fundraiser and logistics person...)
