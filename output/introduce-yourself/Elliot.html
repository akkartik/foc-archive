Hi all :slightly_smiling_face: I'm Elliot. I have a text-visual-hybrid code editor project called <a href="https://elliot.website/editor/">Polytope</a> in which I'm currently working on caret navigation in visual editors, and a local-first multiplayer editor creation api.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Lu Wilson</span> invited me to join this community... I should've joined long ago! Here's some history of my interest in the space: I found out about the FoC podcast at a coding club in Waterloo in 2019. I remember Ravi Chugh's Sketch-n-Sketch really caught my attention back then. Way before that, I think when I was getting more into hobby web development, coming from hobby game development, I watched Bret Victor's "Inventing on Principle" which inspired me. I love learning about people's FoC projects and visions. Many of you in this slack have really inspired me!<br/><br/>I'm currently doing some contracting, working on Polytope, learning some math, and figuring out what to do next in my career.
