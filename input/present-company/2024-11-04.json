And if so, can you provide custom blocks from the outside?\nThat’s a very interesting new idea! We've not experimented with embedding the components in other applications, but it is all open source! :wink: Where do you think our app might be usefully embedded? For sure it's something we'd love to consider if there are exciting reasons? Would love to chat more about this. Up for a call sometime?",
