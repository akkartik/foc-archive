hey everyone, i've been lurking here for a while, and i suppose i've finally summoned up the courage to join in on the conversation (you seem like a nice bunch, so i'm not sure why it took me so long :man-shrugging:). i'm a software developer from lethbridge, canada and like many of you, i've been thinking a lot lately about building more humane mediums for creating software. i'm curious: what were you trying to do when you realized that in order to do it, you needed to learn a programming language?
