I listened to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/terminology-take-100835945">a podcast about Hest recently</a> (that I wasn't even on!), and have been thinking about taking another crack at it. I'm in a really different situation now, work/life wise, and am less inhibited by idealistic ambitions (like a bunch of NIH making me write my own 3D engine, or an obsession with conceptual purity forcing me to make everything bootstrapped). Now the biggest blocker is that I only have scraps of free time, and I've been using all of it to make music. Oh, how I miss being 20 and free from obligation!

Things I would keep: data points flowing on wires, continuous time between 0 and +infinity, pick up and drop data points wherever you want<br/><br/>Things I might do: rewind, 3D, nested components<br/><br/>Things I'll probably ditch: everything else including metaprogramming, shipping some sort of runnable artifact that includes the editor, shutting off the rAF on idle, multiple renderers, modular architecture<br/><br/>I'd probably just make it a weird wrapper around normal-ass JS. Nodes would contain text, because that's easy. I'll just do it for fun and make it weird and useless.
