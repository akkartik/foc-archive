<a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/SARndbox/">Augmented Reality Sandbox</a><br/><br/>&gt; The goal of this project was to develop a real-time integrated augmented reality system to physically create topography models which are then scanned into a computer in real time, and used as background for a variety of graphics effects and simulations. The final product is supposed to be self-contained to the point where it can be used as a hands-on exhibit in science museums with little supervision.
