Hi everyone, I'm happy to find this community here because I haven't been able to talk about future of programming topics since Eve shut down. Are there any meetups planned for the future? I'm living near NYC now, so I would be down for talking about this topic in person. Also looking to see if anyone here has submitted or is planning to attend SplashCon this year.
