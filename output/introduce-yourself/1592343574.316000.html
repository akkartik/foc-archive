I've been posting a few things, so I feel like its time for me to drop an introduction in here. My name is Aleks. I'm a software engineer living and working in Massachusetts. I went to school for game development, but fell in love with programming languages and web development along the way. I'm interested in building tools that make computers easier to use without paving over the underlying complexity of computing. I believe when there's a dissonance between what a program appears to be doing and what a computer is actually doing, it causes pain all up and down the stack - from end users to the folks designing the silicon.<br/><br/>I have a terrible track record of leaving projects unfinished, but I will include a link here to one of my more finished projects - a command line tool for working with tags the same way you would work with files. <a href="https://github.com/alekslitynski/tagsystem">https://github.com/alekslitynski/tagsystem</a>. Like everyone else here, I'm currently hacking on a visual programming system. I'm hoping to get it to a point in the next few months where other people could jump on board and participate in its development, if they want to.<br/><br/>This community seems wonderful, and I'm excited to dive into it.

I went to school for game development, but I don't actually work in the games industry now. It's just something I do off and on for fun. <br/><br/>A few years back I tended to work mostly with Unity, but the parts or Unity I enjoyed seem to have stagnated, so I try to avoid it these days.<br/><br/>In particular, I'm interested in game networking and using the GPU for non-graphics simulation. <br/><br/>As it pertains to this slack community, I find gpgpu programming particularly interesting. It's a space where there's a real need to move beyond C inspired programming languages that also has very hard performance requirements.

Ah, that makes sense. You may enjoy the #of-graphics channel here, fwiw.
