I've been mostly heads down in client work: some good-old API migration from rails to a runs-on-the-JVM-microservice. Not much new on the spreadsheets front. Most interestingly, I've been trying to use cline/aider heavily for regular work and it's been greatly successful. Also been finding MCP + claude desktop useful. (I should sit down and make notes on what workflows work well one of these days).
