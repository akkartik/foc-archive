What I get from the article and the discussion so far:<br/><br/>1. There’s domain knowledge and the challenge to translate that into a software system. <br/>This knowledge is in the heads of domain experts (the potential future users of the software system). Often these people are not programmers.<br/><br/>2. There’s skill involved in architecting software systems, so you end up with a system that has helpful properties like being easy to understand, extensible, efficient, etc.<br/>This knowledge is in the heads of programmers, who often don’t have experience in the specific domain they develop the software system for.<br/><br/>The key idea is to enable domain experts without programming experience to put together software systems.<br/><br/>What I miss in the article is that they are saying the future is “no code” or “less code” and instead something visual. They don’t say much about what that something visual would look like. Which is exactly the hard part.<br/><br/>For some domains we seem to have made good progress to find acceptable abstractions to design such components. I often like to use music production or video editing as examples — domains with lots of complexity and powerful tools that don’t require programming skills (but a lot of domain knowledge). Somehow we haven’t figured out how to do that for our own domain yet.<br/>Maybe that’s a sign that we always need a specific domain. I don’t think so, but it’s a valid argument and obviously not proven.<br/><br/>I like to think spreadsheets are a counter argument to that, looking at all the strange ways non-programmers have found to make them work for their use cases.
