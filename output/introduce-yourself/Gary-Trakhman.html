Hi all! I'm interested in rekindling my love for programming. Somewhere there is a sense of wonder long beaten down by excessive pragmatism since that's what's hot these days.  Is it possible to reconcile these forces when there is too little time and languages and toolsets take time to adopt but most be only superficially different from each other to become mainstream? Let's find out! :smile:<br/><br/>A coworker told me about this group.<br/><br/>I currently mostly do ocaml and python, and some C#.  I love/hate emacs and am trying to do more in VS Code going forward.
