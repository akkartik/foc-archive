You can compare two programs that do the same thing, say written in 2 different languages, by 1) counting the words (i use TextWrangler's word count which is a neutral arbiter), 2) counting the number of IF statements (because they create exponential increase in the possible execution paths), 3) counting the number of distinct API calls that are made, 4) counting the number of libraries one has to import, 5) counting the percentage of punctuation, and 6) counting the amount of documentation with priority given to the parameters to functions, which are very critical to understanding what the functions do. 7) counting the depth of nesting, 8.) measuring the uniqueness of function names; any overloading of a name means ambiguity as to which version of the same function name is actually going to run when called. (Sorry Java, you blew it again with your penchant for overloading!).<br/><br/>Any language which offers dramatic simplification claims has to improve on these fundamental metrics. If you compare .NET for example to almost anything else, .NET will typically compare unfavorably because of the overwhelming amount of API's. Java also has a nightmare when it comes to functions.
