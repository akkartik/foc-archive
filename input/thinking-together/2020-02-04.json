Lets break it apart a bit more.. it's not just the written form, but what the form represents - some abstract ideas (formulae, functions) - are these abstractions essential?\n\nIf *I am the science itself* then I wouldn't need to understand it, I'd just be it. But I'm not science. There is something out there and science gives me a model to grasp that external something (presumably) and fit it internally - something I can understand. This gap is covered by a series of 'mediums' and 'messages' for lack of better words. 'Symbols' are one primitive medium (the idea that 'signifiers represent the signified'), we learn this medium very early in childhood. A message in this medium is 'tree' (doesn't look like a tree, but makes you think of one). The 'written medium' is quite useful too - signs themselves now have physical forms. Sentences are perhaps the next level of medium (a composition of symbols that represents a composite idea). Further, from maths we have variables, propositions, formulae, functions - these are all higher level mediums. We express science in these mediums (e.g. `f=ma` is a message that requires us to *become the medium* first and then absorb its meaning).\n\nWhat is the end goal in this endeavor? We're trying to predict something perhaps, or design something for a purpose - these are our goals, our vision of the purpose.\n\nNow a twist: how do we represent our purpose? _The purpose is just another medium_. When I put pen to paper, I'm using the physical medium to affect the written medium. Is pen and paper incidental? Yes, ideally I'd just think the words and they'd appear on paper. But follow that chain - why am I creating the written words anyway - maybe I'm distributing an idea across. So writing is just incidental - the greater purpose is distributing the idea. Indeed I could make a video instead. (So why spread an idea.. the chain keeps growing) So what's incidental depends entirely on where we 'cut off' our context.\n\nI think what Ivan is saying is that there are multiple alternative paths of medium\/message stacks to get to our goals. All of these are 'incidental complexity'. The simplest solution is having the button with 'my goal' on it, that I push. (Well technically that still has incidental complexity because you'd have to grasp the _medium of buttons_ - push, cause, effect etc.) But anything else on this path from the vision of purpose to purpose fulfillment is incidental.\n\nI've taken the position that 'programs' are a red herring. I think it's based on the fundamental position that all these abstractions, ideas, mediums and messages of thought are incidental and we can choose different ones.",

Sentences are perhaps the next level of medium (a composition of symbols that represents a composite idea). Further, from maths we have variables, propositions, formulae, functions - these are all higher level mediums. We express science in these mediums (e.g. "

Yes, ideally I'd just think the words and they'd appear on paper. But follow that chain - why am I creating the written words anyway - maybe I'm distributing an idea across. So writing is just incidental - the greater purpose is distributing the idea. Indeed I could make a video instead. (So why spread an idea.. the chain keeps growing) So what's incidental depends entirely on where we 'cut off' our context.\n\nI think what Ivan is saying is that there are multiple alternative paths of medium\/message stacks to get to our goals. All of these are 'incidental complexity'. The simplest solution is having the button with 'my goal' on it, that I push.
