Autocomplete is a crutch that sometimes covers fir a complex design. It became very popular in the Java world because of the ridiculous number of function names that one ended up with. <@UC2A2ARPT> is Correct that the Biggest source of error in programming is trying to make sure things are done in the correct order. That is almost 50% of all programming is sequencing the operations. This is why I used deduction to automatically sequence as much as possible. It is the one thing that prolog had that was not copied by other languages after it. I traced the evolution of languages back to the 70s and there was a big funding battle between two groups one based on prologue in the other based on Lisp. Because the prolog group was based in France they of course lost the Funding battle, And after MIT failed to produce any tangible results from 10 years of high level of funding for automatic programming the term AI was poison for another 10 years after that. It has finally been long enough that people have forgotten the over blown claims of AI and now we are back with an AI fetish. This time however machine learning is delivering some good results and in vision language recognition Some of the areas they’re doing great work and this time it won’t blow up in their face. However as Conway has a proof that consciousness cannot be the result of computation there are Limits to the achievements we are going to get from gradient descent ML",

That is almost 50% of all programming is sequencing the operations. This is why I used deduction to automatically sequence as much as possible. It is the one thing that prolog had that was not copied by other languages after it. I traced the evolution of languages back to the 70s and there was a big funding battle between two groups one based on prologue in the other based on Lisp. Because the prolog group was based in France they of course lost the Funding battle, And after MIT failed to produce any tangible results from 10 years of high level of funding for automatic programming the term AI was poison for another 10 years after that. It has finally been long enough that people have forgotten the over blown claims of AI and now we are back with an AI fetish. This time however machine learning is delivering some good results and in vision language recognition Some of the areas they’re doing great work and this time it won’t blow up in their face. However as Conway has a proof that consciousness cannot be the result of computation there are Limits to the achievements we are going to get from gradient descent ML"
