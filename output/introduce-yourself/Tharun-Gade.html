Hi all, I'm tharun from India. I"m currently pursuing my bachelor's degree(expected to graduate in 2023). I'm enthused to learn new things about programming.<br/>wanna know how did I end up here? here you go. I was feeling bored and opened HackerNews, and found "Stop Writing Dead Programs" by Jack Rusher (Strange Loop 2022) I watched the entire video, and at the end, he showed the factorial of a number using Hest by Ivan Reese. I went to his website and found this community and now I'm here:smile:.
