I'd like to create a Functional Programming channel. The Slack UI only lets me create private channels, so I guess I need to request this on Meta.<br/><br/>The background is that somebody recently hijacked my functional programming thread on General with a diatribe attacking functional programming. I responded with a defence of functional programming, written in a similar (inflammatory) style, which you may have seen. I wrote in that style to make a point, because this has happened to me several times. While my diatribe was fun to write, maybe some of you want me to stop posting this material to General. Also, it's hard to have a discussion when people are shouting you down. It may be good if the functional programming community has a "safe space" in which to have discussions.
