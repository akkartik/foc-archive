Hi folks, let me do my introduction to this delightful community. I’m an industry coder currently doing webdev and frontend at Shutterfly. A few years back I was building a cool language for live programming called Circa-lang, which I showed at a few conferences.  That project is no more but I’m still interested in building the next generation of dev ecosystems. These days I’m more interested in how we can expand the role of databases and/or spreadsheets, and reduce the need for coding.<br/><br/>On my bookshelf right now is a biography on Wittgenstein, and a Minecraft story book (since the kids are full-on crazy about Minecraft right now). Nice to meet you all
