god, this longread on the software industry hasn't aged in a decade<br/><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/</a><br/>> Somehow it keeps working out. The industry is always promising to eat itself, to come up with a paradigm so perfect that we can all stop wasting our time and enter a world of pure digital thought. It never happens.<br/>it's very much a bird's eye view but there's a fantastic balance between the beauty and the ravenous ouroborous<br/>> Languages are liquid infrastructure.

You grab an old PC thatâ€™s outlived its usefulness, put Linux on it, and suddenly you have a powerful Web server.
