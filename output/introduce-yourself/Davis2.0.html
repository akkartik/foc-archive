Hi folks!! I’m a brand new baby coder. At 37, I’m changing careers from being a fire-medic, to studying computer science. I love my job but due to injuries, it’s time to move on. Fortunately, I’ve fallen in love with coding and the amount of creativity it takes to solve a problem. Currently I am working through freecodecamp and just started playing with python. Also, MIT open source is absolutely incredible. So thankful for the amount of knowledge they are willing to share.<br/>Steve’s podcast is how I found this group. Hoping I will have some projects to share soon.
