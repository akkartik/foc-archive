So <https:\/\/ashleyblewer.com\/|Ashley Blewer> has created this <https:\/\/bits.ashleyblewer.com\/halt-and-catch-fire-syllabus\/|wonderful syllabus> to go along with the TV show \"Halt and Catch Fire\" (2014-2017), \"a fictional narrative about people working in tech during the 1980s-1990s.\" The syllabus features readings on the history of technology, computers, programming etc. as well as recommended RFCs and emulators of old systems to take a look at to provide material for discussions about a set of episodes.\n\nI wanted to watch the show for a long time now, and since I really enjoy the A Pattern Language book club that was linked to here a few months ago, I thought it might be a nice idea to create a watch club to go through the series together–the way Ashley intended!\n\nI created a Discord for this purpose. Right now, no date has been set for the first session, as I want to give people some time to show up first. I'll announce the schedule soon. If all this sounds like something you might be interested in, please join me in this adventure!\n\nHere's the link: <https:\/\/discord.gg\/T3BDJN6AXz>",
