Don't be afraid of more words :slightly_smiling_face:\n• I also would appreciate some intuition\/analogy in words at the start of how\/why the algorithm works. I love this method of organizing explanations <https:\/\/betterexplained.com\/articles\/adept-method\/>\n• I would consider putting the your first interactive visualization at the end as opposed to the beginning of the article. If the point of the algorithm is edge detection, it's hard to see that in placing single points. Maybe that interactive has more to do with *how* the algorithm works, while the interactive at the end shows the result of the algorithm.\n• It would be neat in the last interactive viz if you could moreover the graph and it would show you the point in the diagram. Even better if it as was connected to the original picture!",

Changing the order of the diagrams is a good idea, I'll try that too. I'm not sure I understood your last point, could you explain that again? Thanks :wink:",

You're right that there's barely any description of how the hough transform works or why it's useful\/necessary. I should definitely improve on that. Changing the order of the diagrams is a good idea, I'll try that too. I'm not sure I understood your last point, could you explain that again? Thanks "
