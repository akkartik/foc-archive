I have no idea why.\n:thinking_face: That's weird, I'm using a fuzzy search package, I'll take a look into it\n\n&gt;  I find the asymmetry between the CALL TREE area and the main area a little jarring.  I mean in the CALL TREE, a function can be shown, hidden, or unlisted whereas in the main area, a function can be shown, collapsed, or unlisted.\nYeah the UX is pretty much WIP. So I have many ideas of interactions but I'm still not sure which ones are useful :sweat_smile:\nClose to the right, close, collapse, show\/hide will have really different use cases, but I can't be sure which ones to keep until I test them with a real project. Which takes me to the current work. I'm using the GitHub API to get the information, but it has a rate limit of 50 req\/hour, so I haven't been able to play with a medium size project to see what's useful. Right now I'm working on the backend to add authenticated GitHub API requests which will increase the rate limit to 5,000\/h.\n\nAnyways, I'd love to chat <@UA14TGLTC>, are you available during the weekend?",

Which takes me to the current work. I'm using the GitHub API to get the information, but it has a rate limit of 50 req\/hour, so I haven't been able to play with a medium size project to see what's useful. Right now I'm working on the backend to add authenticated GitHub API requests which will increase the rate limit to 5,000\/h.\n\nAnyways, I'd love to chat "
