Particularly nice on small screens. To fix this I had to wrap code\/pre\/verbatim blocks, and truncate the display of some long hyperlinks. In the process I've also started deleting `utm_` gunk from the URLs altogether.\n\nNew issue identified but not yet fixed: intro pages (<http:\/\/akkartik.name\/archives\/foc\/introduce-yourself\/alex.html|example>) can have conflicts! The names displayed in Slack turn out not to be unique usernames even though they often look like unique handles. I'm not sure what to do about this without breaking <http:\/\/akkartik.name\/archives\/foc\/share-your-work\/1650304069.425419.html|the bookmarklet>.
