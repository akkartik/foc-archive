In order to be able to replay a program deterministically you need to be able to capture all possible inputs.

If you decide to change the code to make a new request in a different order or with different parameters then well... it can’t replay that safely so it’d have to prompt the user to do another manual run. For a network heavy app like that most of the running time is waiting for the network so replays would be pretty fast.\n\nFor a 2D game… that’s a lot harder to deterministically reproduce, especially at speed. You’d need to replay each mouse\/keyboard event at the appropriate times in the main event loop, and you’d need to replay all the event\/render loops with the same timestamp they originally occurred at - so if you take a 5min long capture of gameplay then well… replaying that could be pretty slow, even if you cut out all the sleeps, max out your CPU and skip the actual rendering. That is unless you can find a way to make it faster by snapshotting state and skipping steps.\n\nInspiration for this (and considering that it might even be possible to deterministically record and replay programs) came from the RR project: <https:\/\/rr-project.org\/>.
