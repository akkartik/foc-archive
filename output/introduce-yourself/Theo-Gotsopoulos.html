Hi from the sunny UK! I am a software engineer that recently found out about this community and I keep reading and learning about different projects. Some ideas I've seen while looking related articles/projects resemble some of mine, usually as a better expression of mine, so it feels like this is a very interesting place for me at this time, mainly to explore.<br/><br/>At this stage, where I am figuring out a lot of things, I'm interested to learn more about what others are working on and discuss about projects or directions/concepts in general until maybe I find something to devote more time into, more seriously than just like a day of experiments.<br/><br/>Can also be reached in Mastodon here <a href="https://phpc.social/@thgs">@thgs</a>
