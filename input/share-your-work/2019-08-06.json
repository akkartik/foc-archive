        "text": "Interesting topic. 'Why X is hard' is a very difficult if not impossible question to answer. E.g. did folks realize 'why arithmetic is hard' when working with roman numerals? Did they say 'actually arithmetic is hard because the *notation* we use doesn't make some operations easy'? I doubt it. The very notion of *notation* was likely not present in the mental model of people - otherwise they might have set out for a better notation sooner. What about building larger huts and houses? Did folks realize they needed architecture? Perhaps when the only things they saw is material strength, they might have thought that the only thing they need are stronger materials to build larger structures.\n\nSo we might not know why programming is hard until (and if) we find mental models that makes some things significantly easier. I look at the above diagram above as a specific mental model. One thing that seems missing is cognition - where does that fit in? Isn't the entire model inside our brains (so there should be a larger brain surrounding the entire diagram?). We have a mental model of all three things in there (even if they are hard to simulate, we do have the capacity to model them). A tangential question I would ask based on the above diagram is: in a world where programming is significantly easier, what is the mental model of human computer interaction? Is it still the above diagram?",

What about building larger huts and houses? Did folks realize they needed architecture? Perhaps when the only things they saw is material strength, they might have thought that the only thing they need are stronger materials to build larger structures.\n\nSo we might not know why programming is hard until (and if) we find mental models that makes some things significantly easier. I look at the above diagram above as a specific mental model. One thing that seems missing is cognition - where does that fit in? Isn't the entire model inside our brains (so there should be a larger brain surrounding the entire diagram?). We have a mental model of all three things in there (even if they are hard to simulate, we do have the capacity to model them). A tangential question I would ask based on the above diagram is: in a world where programming is significantly easier, what is the mental model of human computer interaction? Is it still the above diagram?"
