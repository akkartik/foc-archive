<b>Welcome to #thinking-together!</b><br/><br/>This is the new channel for discussions based on our own thoughts and questions about the future of computing.<br/><br/>• While you can add reference links to your posts, please take any discussions that center around external links to #linking-together <br/>• While you can discuss the future in light of the present, please take any discussions that are mostly about computing (or the world) of today to #present-company<br/>• If you'd like to discuss your own work, (A) please do that a lot it's great I love it (B) over in #share-your-work<br/>• If you'd like to discuss the future of a particular subject, don't miss our subject-specific channels about the future #of-end-user-programming, #of-graphics, #of-functional-programming, and #of-music.<br/>I am working on a new Member's Handbook that will be the canonical home for our cultural norms (how we use Slack messages, the channels, etc) — so stay tuned for that if you aren't quite sure about how to make the most of the new organizational scheme.<br/><br/>One final note — I attempted to add everyone in the Slack to #announcements and #present-company, but the Slack UI for this is not great. I know for certain I didn't get everyone, and I can't easily tell who I missed, so if you aren't in those channels then I encourage you to join them.
