To me, Luna is (was) a way of making an ML family language much nicer to work with, but it is not truly visual programming (and neither is Max\/MSP, etc). Whereas, DeepUI actually is visual programming in the truest sense, and that, for my money, is a very exciting space just waiting to be explored. There absolutely are ways to scale this sort of a model up handle arbitrary complexity — but, I agree, it will take a tremendous amount of work.

To me, Luna is (was) a way of making an ML family language much nicer to work with, but it is not truly visual programming (and neither is Max\/MSP, etc). Whereas, DeepUI actually is visual programming in the truest sense, and that, for my money, is a very exciting space just waiting to be explored. There absolutely are ways to scale this sort of a model up handle arbitrary complexity — but, I agree, it will take a tremendous amount of work. (Though, certainly, not as much work as has gone into gcc, JVM, or v8)"

Whether this is worth paying for depends on what you'll use Enso for, so I guess this means they're going to (perhaps subtly) focus Enso on server-y stuff rather than GP programming. (Edit much later: I misread this as hosting the _output_ of Enso, rather than hosting the tool Enso itself. Hosting the tool makes a lot more sense.)\n\nMarketplace — this is my \"if I can't think of anything better, copy Unity\" idea for monetizing Hest. I hope I think of something better, because this feels like the sort of thing you should do _after_ your tool becomes wildly popular. Otherwise, you end up with a bit of a ghost-town effect, and I've certainly been put off of participating in marketplaces because of that.",

We're big on the idea of \"design the gameplay first, then figure out what you can use that gameplay to teach\" as opposed to the reverse. We also have a huge focus on systems-thinking, since we specialize in teaching troubleshooting skills. We _also_ also strive to impart the \"spirit of engineering\", in addition to familiarity with particular technical matter.\n\nOne problem that we continually run into is that our biggest clients expect their educational software to fit a very specific, very familiar format. They buy educational software primarily for compliance reasons, not with an interest in helping people learn and do better at their jobs. (Worth noting: these clients are multinational companies, mostly focussed on resources, manufacturing, or transportation — business not known for being progressive.) They want multiple choice quizzes. They want slideshows. When we build things that learners genuinely enjoy using, we often have trouble getting higher-ups to deploy them across their org.\n\nSo I bristle at Blow's contention that there aren't people out there trying to make these sorts of games. There are! It's just not a guarantee that if we build it, they (customers) will come.",

They buy educational software primarily for compliance reasons, not with an interest in helping people learn and do better at their jobs. (Worth noting: these clients are multinational companies, mostly focussed on resources, manufacturing, or transportation — business not known for being progressive.) They want multiple choice quizzes. They want slideshows. When we build things that learners genuinely enjoy using, we often have trouble getting higher-ups to deploy them across their org.\n\nSo I bristle at Blow's contention that there aren't people out there trying to make these sorts of games. There are! It's just not a guarantee that if we build it, they (customers) will come."

The core idea of having an accessible system for creating interactive media content that works across a range of devices is still a powerful one. Just like pencil and paper is a powerful tool. I hope it will happen again. Many years ago, I had the idea of Flash Forever. How can we treat what is created in Flash as valuable information like a book? Sadly, the need to drive business growth by adding features and capabilities, trumped the need for permanence. It’s great that Flash still lives in the skills and experiences of the community of people who learned and grew with it.”\n -- Jonathan Gay,  Creator of Flash",

When we hire a content creator, we hire only for art skills, and then train them how to program well enough to add logic and interactivity to their artwork — basic procedural code: variables, conditionals, calling functions, but not necessarily even arrays or maps. That training process takes about six months (most of it focused on domain-specific stuff), but they're usually able to build simple simulations pretty much immediately. We typically have 3-6 artists on the team. We'd happily train them much further in programming, but none of them have wanted to learn that yet (can't blame them.. which is why we're all here, right?)\n\nOur current pipeline is:\n1. Draw in Adobe Animate (nee Flash) or Illustrator, with names given to various objects in the drawing.\n2. Export to SVG (which forces us to only use a safe subset of drawing features, sadly)\n3. Run a simple CLI tool to scaffold an interactive simulation atop our in-house <https:\/\/github.com\/cdig\/svga\/wiki|framework> (titled SVGA)\n4. Write some high-level CoffeeScript code to express the simulation logic, add controls, etc.\n5. Run a CLI command to deploy to our site. The final result is a single HTML file that works in any modern browser. Typical build size is about 200 KB, including the framework.\nIt takes one of our artists about a week to build <https:\/\/www.lunchboxsessions.com\/materials\/deere-hitachi-excavators-shovels\/hitachi-arm-regenerative-circuit-simulation|something like this> from scratch, with a fairly even split of time between planning, research, design, art, and coding. According to `cloc`, that linked simulation is about 1700 lines of SVG art (after automatic optimizations), and 600 LOC of CoffeeScript simulation logic (where the amount framework boilerplate in that is probably less than 5%)\n\n(If you're not familiar with it, the graphical symbols we use are fairly standard in <https:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/?q=iso+hydraulic+schematic|hydraulic schematics>, with a bit of our own spin to make them more amenable to animation).\n\nThat framework I keep referencing is about 4k LOC, and took probably 6 months to develop, spread out a fair bit.\n\nFinally — the FoC project I'm building, <https:\/\/futureofcoding.slack.com\/archives\/C0120A3L30R\/p1586795860004500|Hest>, is intended to take us away from writing text-based code at all, to let us build these simulations inside an Adobe\/Autodesk-esq graphical environment. I've been working on Hest off-and-on for about 5 years now, and plan for it to be the main thing I work on for the next decade (aside from keeping our web services alive, of course)",

When we hire a content creator, we hire only for art skills, and then train them how to program well enough to add logic and interactivity to their artwork — basic procedural code: variables, conditionals, calling functions, but not necessarily even arrays or maps. That training process takes about six months (most of it focused on domain-specific stuff), but they're usually able to build simple simulations pretty much immediately. We typically have 3-6 artists on the team. We'd happily train them much further in programming, but none of them have wanted to learn that yet (can't blame them.. which is why we're all here, right?)\n\nOur current pipeline is:\n"

        "text": "<@UC6997THT> I think there is a market for that. It'd just cost a lot to build a modern equivalent of Flash (the authoring tool) that publishes efficiently to the web. Not amenable to a startup, and I don't think most existing companies have the culture for it.\n\nThis problem is what I've spent much of the last decade working on at my job, but at a small scale, focused just on making an alternative to Flash for our unique needs.

Flash had to create its own file format and player because there was no built-in functionality for multimedia on the web. There wasn't even audio — remember RealPlayer? There were other plugins they could have hooked into (Java Applets, say) but those sucked.\n\nWhat we _can_ have now (though nobody has done a good job of it) is an authoring tool that can spit out self-contained files that work anywhere (on the web), thanks to HTML and the web platform. So as long as your authoring tool produces nicely self-contained single HTML files, you're a lot closer to having that particular question answered, without needing a boil the ocean \"our plugin is on 97% of PCs\" solution.\n\nSo the distribution is \"tied\" to the editor only insofar as the editor needs to do just that — spit out files that people can actually use.",

For folks in this community, we might stand to gain more from being a judge than being an entrant — maybe. And yeah, totally agree, some details of how Replit are structuring and promoting this contest are gross. But I think that's just capitalism — we here have the option to not participate in it, and I don't think that they do (what with investors to satisfy, etc.)\n\nLove that you shared these thoughts, Yoshiki. Even though Replit are a benefactor of this community, their support should not shield them from criticism, especially criticism that we could all learn from that will help us do better if\/when some of our projects are turned into businesses and we're faced with marketing challenges and the pressures of capitalism ourselves.\n\n(And if Replit decide that they don't want to fund a community that reflects honestly and critically on what they do — though I expect Amjad et al would be fine with it — then there will be other ways to pay for the podcast, fear not)",

For folks in this community, we might stand to gain more from being a judge than being an entrant — maybe. And yeah, totally agree, some details of how Replit are structuring and promoting this contest are gross. But I think that's just capitalism — we here have the option to not participate in it, and I don't think that they do (what with investors to satisfy, etc.)\n\nLove that you shared these thoughts, Yoshiki. Even though Replit are a benefactor of this community, their support should not shield them from criticism, especially criticism that we could all learn from that will help us do better if\/when some of our projects are turned into businesses and we're faced with marketing challenges and the pressures of capitalism ourselves.\n\n(And if Replit decide that they don't want to fund a community that reflects honestly and critically on what they do — though I expect Amjad et al would be fine with it — then there will be other ways to pay for the podcast, fear not)"
