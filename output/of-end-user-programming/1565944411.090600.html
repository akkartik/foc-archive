You are 100% correct that the introduction of API's instead of memory mapped state info is a drawback. This by the way was Wozniak's greatest contribution to the Apple OS, and what made it so brilliant. Every device was memory mapped in low RAM so you could POKE a value into a memory location and get a character drawn on the screen, etc. some could be read (PEEK) and some could be both read and written like the screen. Fast forward to now, you have 1000 api calls in OSX to do the same things that took zero calls in Apple OS. This is retrograde progress, and i have put as many state variables as i could scrounge in Beads, however as i just pointed out modern OS'es are perverse in their love of API's and you can't actually interrogate so easily. One of the problems is that modern computers want to allow multiple connected mice at the same time, and support all sorts of weird stuff that complexifies the whole thing.
