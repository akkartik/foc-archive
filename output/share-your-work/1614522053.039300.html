GUI improvement for WhiteBox (my real-time C/C++ debugger &amp; execution inspector):<br/>limiting variables on the timeline to only show the time ranges when they're in-scope (implemented on stream at <a href="https://twitch.tv/azmreece">https://twitch.tv/azmreece</a>).<br/>General overview demo here: <a href="https://media.handmade-seattle.com/whitebox-systems/">https://media.handmade-seattle.com/whitebox-systems/</a>

This is amazing!! Very interesting resonances with this Bret Victor screenshot I shared at <a href="../thinking-together/1607887127.284300.html">../thinking-together/1607887127.284300.html</a>

Woah, that's really cool! How does this work with more complex, nested objects &amp; structs?

Thanks! :smile:<br/><br/>Yeah that screenshot has been rattling around my head since I first watched Bret Victor's talks. Similar to some of the issues you were describing with Mu, scaling is non-trivial, and I don't think Bret's prototype here scales without a few changes. This is particularly true in my case, where I have added the constraint that all primary information has to communicable without changing the way the editor itself presents the code.<br/><br/>&gt; How does this work with more complex, nested objects &amp; structs?<br/>1. at the most basic level, the variable names on the left can be expanded to show its members. You can see this happen 1-level deep in the above GIF when I expand <tt>rect</tt>, but this can happen recursively as many times as needed<br/>2. This is not the only code visualizer in the tool, and others may be more appropriate for complex structures<br/>3. I'm thinking of adding the option of expanding the timeline so each 1D bar becomes a 2D canvas that can show each value in a more semantically-aware way

Great work! I watched your general overview demo before, and found the timeline a bit hard to read at a quick glance, but with this seemingly simple GUI change, it's <em>much</em> easier to read!<br/><br/>And big props for doing the hard work of translating Bret's prototype into a real tool. I want this yesterday. When I can debug with this kind of view, and see data structures like <a href="http://symbolflux.com/projects/avd">Lucidity</a>, I'll be a happy programmer. Best of luck with bringing it to market!<br/><br/>&gt; This is not the only code visualizer in the tool<br/>Which other visualizers are there? Or maybe I should just re-watch the demo video to jog my memory.

Sorry for the incredibly(!) late reply - I've been a bit absent from slack recently.<br/><br/>Thanks! It definitely goes some way to turning it from an undifferentiated mass to something with structure with reference points that you can orient yourself with. I've just added colour by type in what is hopefully an interesting and useful way... I'll share more on that later<br/><br/>I feel like the conceptual stuff I'm doing is pretty low-hanging fruit, there are just implementation difficulties to deal with :grinning:<br/>Lucidity is great, I've had plans to include something similar, although with a slightly different emphasis (and probably not 3D initially!)<br/><br/>I should do a better job of distinguishing things currently in the tool and things designed/planned :grin:<br/>Current outputs are:<br/>• function inputs &amp; outputs (text)<br/>• debugger watch window details for the cursor position (text)<br/>• all the changes that any variable/member goes through (text)<br/>• graph of changes for primitive number vars<br/>• timeline<br/>There are many more planned, but I'm trying to be sensible with making sure the foundations are really solid before adding representations.
