Works on both Observable and Lopecode.\n\n• live: if you add\/remove a cell the visualisation update.\n• navigable: if you click a cell you are taken to the cell source (on observable this opens a new tab and scrolls to the cell)\n• interactive: as you scroll though birds eye view the detailed visualization expands the dependancies of the focused cell. You can click to pin the current cell.\nThe overall point of this notebook is to provoke the reader into understanding the programming model and ask questions like \"what is a viewof\" when they try to understand the dependancy graph. Its also useful for authors to find stray dependancies and plan refactors on complex notebook networks.\n<https:\/\/observablehq.com\/@tomlarkworthy\/cell-map>",
