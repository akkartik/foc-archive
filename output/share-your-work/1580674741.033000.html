Hi! Operon 0.5.0 is out, find it from <a href="https://operon.io">https://operon.io</a> (Java-binary and pdf-booklet). It is also the first public release and I'm hoping for feedback on the most rudimentary things; did you get the queries running (if you had a chance to try)? What was your initial impression on the language? Did you encounter anything illogical or that you could consider as possible design flaw? I have not yet documented everything, so there's more to come on later releases. Also none of the components were yet released, so it is just the core that is out now. Love to hear back from you! :grin:
