it's hard to find verticals for the long tails of use cases, it's hard to think what people search when they have a problem, where do they gather, what words the use (a customer used bulletin boards for dashboards, another used control panel), also there are many that don't search or try because they don't know that there's a solution for it, or others gave up and don't search any more
