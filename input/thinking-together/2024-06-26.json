I would like for everybody here to think hard about what they consider infrastructure worth building upon, if it really does have to be that high up the stack, and what the reasons are why they think they can't go a level deeper. And if those reasons break down to just “it’s more convenient, because it’s already available”, then I’d like them to reflect on what that does to us culturally, and why we ended up in a world where nobody seriously believes they can build their own house anymore.

        "text": "> Seriously? You know how to program. You know more than one programming language. It’s all the same anyway. What makes you think you lack competence in building anything you can dream of that is made out of code?\n\"Seriously? You know how to write. You can even write in more than one language. It's all the same anyway. What makes you think you can't write a novel in any genre you can think of, or draft laws, or work in a programming language spec committee?\"\n\nHopefully this analogy shows the absurdity of thinking programming is all the same, of confusing the thing with the reductionist view of the thing. Yes, you can do with programming -- as with reading -- everything humans can do. But basic literacy is a very, very small initial step in doing it all.\n\nIt's not just that <@UJBAJNFLK> has to build a network stack, it's also the display stack, and the font shaping and a million other things, each of which somebody built up a career around. I remember one Thanksgiving I was an absolutely terrible person to be around because I was trying to print floating-point numbers.\n\n> It reminds me of Christopher Alexander pointing out how our current culture has managed to convince regular people that they can’t build their own houses.\nCA looks to regular people (among whom I now number myself, now that I'm past my twenties) like this: imagine you're living in a little mountainside hamlet surrounded by towering peaks. Each peak has an aqueduct leading down from it, feeding the village with some different essential raw material. CA is up there on one peak saying, \"hey look! I made it up so you can too!\" He's right, but that's just one peak. What hubris to think I would want to go to _the exact same peak_ as him?! You're not in my top 3, Chris. To do the thing he's actually suggesting, I have to scale _all_ the peaks, rebuild all the aqueducts.\n\nI was even more ridiculous, way down on foothill Mu of some other peak, telling people everyone should be going off and building their own aqueducts for everything. I didn't even have the personal track record. I just muddied that one patch on the mountainside with all my attempts to climb a few inches.\n\n> Ivan Sutherland supposedly said about inventing the first interactive graphics program, the first non-procedural programming language, the first object oriented software system, all in one year with Sketchpad, “Well, I didn’t know it was hard.”\nIvan Sutherland had one huge advantage: it was not infrastructure _then_. There was no shared expectation of the features it \"had\" to have. But it's infrastructure now. That train has passed.\n\nI'm starting to think depending on sharing infrastructure is the essential characteristic of human beings. It is what we mean when we say human beings are social. We build things, then we depend on them, and if enough people depend on them then we're stuck with them.\n\nYes, one person can go off and choose not to depend on it. But:\n\n• It is _impossible_ for a community to make those choices together without going off the reservation entirely. You'd start looking like a cult. You have to be willing to be seen by others to have joined a cult.\n• You can never be sure you'll suddenly find the need for some bit of infrastructure you thought you'd never need. Like that floating-point printer of mine. Every time that happens, I feel stupid, and then I realize how ridiculous I seem to others _all the time_.\nAll this is not to say we shouldn't try. We should absolutely try. I'm still up there making a spectacle of myself on a slightly different spot. But it's important to be clear-eyed about the endeavor. Let's not kid ourselves that there's anything obvious or normal or easy about trying to replace infrastructure. It may well be a giant waste of time, a dead end on the road to finding a better way to live.",
