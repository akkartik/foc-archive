Hey, I've been working on a language to specify serverless systems and I just started playing around with making it visual.  Would love some feedback on these mocks.  The goal of Strat is to specify how your code packages talk to each other in the cloud without specifying infrastructure details, then the Strat compiler builds out your infra for you.  The textual representation (which would be isomorphic with the visual one) can be seen here: <a href="https://strat.world">https://strat.world</a>.  The biggest delta between Strat and other visual languages is Strat doesn't care about computation; it lets other programming languages handle that domain.

It's hard to offer much GUI advice just based on this one picture. You're using color to keep things differentiated, which is nice. It looks like things are paused so that you can inspect data flowing over the wire, which is great.<br/><br/>So much of what makes or breaks a visual programming tool is in the moment-to-moment interaction, so be sure you leave yourself plenty of time and energy to invest in that.

I would also suggest considering how things might look in the worst case scenario. With only 9 nodes, arranged in 3 discrete flows, things are clear and simple. But what happens when you need to wire up something far more complex? How do you debug the system when something goes wrong? What does it look like when your text fields / labels are much longer? How easy/fluid is it to select multiple things and move them around? How do people learn the GUI? These are just some of the things that will need to be answered as you advance the design. Once those questions are answered, and you've prototyped or built something based on that thinking, you should share it here for more feedback :slightly_smiling_face:

I totally agree with Ivan's comment about the worst case scenario. Yes, always think about how the visuals will look when there are alot of APIs. I have worked with customers who have over 10,000 different APIs to visualize, and managability becomes a serious issue, unless this is designed only for small sets of APIs
