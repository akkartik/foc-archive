We want to write large apps with lots of users that can run efficiently on AWS.\n\nBut computing is _staggeringly cheap._ If we are willing to entertain “inefficiency”, we can make small business and individual user software in very different ways to what we do now.\n\nThis and other aspects of the economics of all this lead me to believe that our default when storing data is that it is a write-only store. The “current” version of a row is the one with the latest timestamp.\n\nIt is easy enough to roll event sourcing into this. We already “store” incoming requests — in the stupid text log file, if nowhere else. If instead, we store full, structured inputs to each request coming into a system in a database table (because we’re all about relations), then we arrive at the results of an input to a system are the results of triggers on those inputs.\n\nStep back, and consider the larger picture: every state the system was ever in can be reviewed. Every input to the system is recorded, and every state transition.\n\nNow, we circle back to small business software, and to my other bugbear: we don’t make software for non-developers to solve their own problems.\n\nBut if you put a FileMaker-like interface in front of that write-only store, and you think about augmenting that UI with tools to explore its history, I think you really have something.\n\nFuture of programming? Give me this system, with a Datalog query interface, and I can replace most of what I do in a traditional programming language with queries. Traditional programming is relegated to side-effecting or efficiency-concerned stuff.",

The “current” version of a row is the one with the latest timestamp.\n\nIt is easy enough to roll event sourcing into this. We already “store” incoming requests — in the stupid text log file, if nowhere else. If instead, we store full, structured inputs to each request coming into a system in a database table (because we’re all about relations), then we arrive at the results of an input to a system are the results of triggers on those inputs.\n\nStep back, and consider the larger picture: every state the system was ever in can be reviewed. Every input to the system is recorded, and every state transition.\n\nNow, we circle back to small business software, and to my other bugbear: we don’t make software for non-developers to solve their own problems.\n\nBut if you put a FileMaker-like interface in front of that write-only store, and you think about augmenting that UI with tools to explore its history, I think you really have something.\n\nFuture of programming? Give me this system, with a Datalog query interface, and I can replace most of what I do in a traditional programming language with queries. Traditional programming is relegated to side-effecting or efficiency-concerned stuff."
