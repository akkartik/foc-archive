Hi everyone!<br/><br/>I'm Tomas - I have been lurking here for some time, but I thought it may be time to join properly. I've been involved in various things around programming languages (functional programming in F#, type systems for tracking context information, type providers and tools for data science) - but recently my interest has been stateful and interactive "programming systems" (as opposed to "programming languages"). With <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Joel Jakubovic</span> and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span>, we wrote <a href="https://tomasp.net/techdims/">Technical dimensions of programming systems</a>. I've also been trying to make sense of some interesting past programming systems like <a href="https://tomasp.net/commodore64/">BASIC</a> and I post various other things at <a href="https://tomasp.net/">https://tomasp.net/</a><br/><br/>After happy 10 years in the UK, I moved back to Prague and I'm now an assistant professor at Charles University (and we have some funding for post-docs and PhD students interested in those topics!) I will also be organising the &lt;Programming&gt; 2025 conference in Prague in June next year! <a href="https://2025.programming-conference.org/">https://2025.programming-conference.org/</a>
