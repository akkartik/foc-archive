Hello! Brandon Hudgeons from Austin, Texas. VP Technology at <a href="http://www.schoox.com">www.schoox.com</a> and General Counsel and BTC enthusiast at <a href="http://www.unchained-capital.com">www.unchained-capital.com</a>. I do most of my dayjob coding in Scala right now, but tons of polyglot stuff wherever I go. I have a feeling I know (or rather know of) many of you in here, and I'm angry at <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> for not telling me about this group until today :slightly_smiling_face:. Just a short scroll up #thinking-together tells me that this group addresses lots of my interests, but I think it will take me a week to get through the 64-post-long (so far) thread from yesterday. I've been interested in, listening to, and playing with Tidal for a long time, so having <span style="background-color:#ccf">@alex</span> in here for me is like being in a Slack group with Taylor Swift for a 13 year old girl :heart_eyes:. And wow ... while I was searching for "alex," <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Alex Miller</span> popped up ... I was at the first 4 Strange Loops ... the first one was where I saw Scala for the first time! Glad to finally be in here.
