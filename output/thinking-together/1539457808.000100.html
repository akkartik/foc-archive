&gt; If you consider the “current implementation” something that is inherently bad for some reason, I’d love for you to elaborate why that is.<br/><br/>Not inherently bad (I still don't know where you're getting that from) but inherently a bad fit for certain purposes. Like the ones we've discussed here: incentivizing creators on Youtube or on open source projects.<br/><br/>My rough rule of thumb is that if it's a task where someone (<em>any other person on the planet</em> excluding the one performing the task) can come along afterwards and say objectively that the task was done well or not, and the ruling is not subject to change in the future, then money and similar extrinsic incentives[1] work well. But if it's a task that's impossible to verify then you end up needing to rely on intrinsic motivation[2]. It's impossible for a manager or user to tell if a software project is good. It can seem to do the task but turn out to be infected with malware. It may be fine initially but get an automatic update that is user hostile. With these possibilities I no longer feel secure just paying dollars for a product. I need to know who built it and get a sense for their motivations. I need to build a <em>relationship</em> with them.<br/><br/>Hopefully this clarifies where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>[1] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Incentive_theories:_intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Incentive_theories:&hellip;</a><br/><br/>[2] This is why professing "passion" for a job is a thing that happens. Employers know they have a task that requires intrinsic motivation, and employees know that employers know.
