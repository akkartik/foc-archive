I've made some very nice UX improvements to the visual programming system that I am working on: it's now possible to replace a node with compatible node-types without hassle. When a node is selected, compatible node-types are shown in a dropdown. This helps especially when doing more creative work when creating a shader/gl flow for example and getting more feeling on what the impact is of certain mathematical operations (in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/K-956F6Vwps">https://youtu.be/K-956F6Vwps</a> I change a multiply node to an arctan calculation).<br/><br/>Another improvement is being able to insert a node into an existing connection.. also taking compatibility into account. This speeds up the creation process of flows in general.<br/><br/>Under the hood I've also made a nice improvement: I can now use jsx components using vanilla DOM without the use of react or other libraries. This is a nice DX improvement when developing my project.
