I know this isn't quite at the conciseness that is usually shared here, but today we made some strong progress on our Driver SDK design in TypeScript to support really flexible i18n definitions.<br/><br/>I'm quite proud of the conciseness of the demo recording (esp at 1.5x, haha).<br/><br/>• Part 1 of our progress today including an overview of the type checking experience while developing a service driver with the SDK <b><a href="https://www.loom.com/share/d575f780680c48f2a20d7c24ec2e2ace">2021-03 DriverSDK define-service.ts — storytime-pr - Part 1: Type definitions</a></b><br/>• <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/662638c0855b45d485f4ffd1852b9174">Part 2 (english localization)</a> demonstrating the way which a localization can be set up for "wolfram solve" action and some insights into the way param qualification are likely going to evolve in the future<br/>I deeply appreciate all the inspiring links, discussions, and feedback I come across here, and I would love to see if our ideas resonate or inspire anyone else.

For a bit more context we are building basically a low-code sort of platform that's heavily text / language based with embedded symbols and values in line.<br/><br/>This work is part of the design of our "driver SDK" which you would use to write integrations for services.
