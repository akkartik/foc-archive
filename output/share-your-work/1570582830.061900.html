I had never heard about tree notation before, but it looks very interesting! But I can't say that your blog post has helped me much with understanding tree notation (I find the standard Web site much clearer).<br/>Example: you say that each cell has a cellSize. Fine. You don't say what a cellSize is, sematically, but the name "size" suggests a magnitude (e.g. a number). Then you say that cells can be combined horizontally and/or vertically. So is the cellSize perhaps a pair of numbers?<br/>Next, a Tree consists of a line of cells and/or a plane of child Trees. Neither line nor plane have been defined, so I take them to have their standard meaning in geometry. let's take the "and" case: a tree can then be a line of cells AND a plane of child trees. I have no idea what that would look like.

Very helpful! Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span>. Yes, cellSize as currently envisioned is a pair of numbers, with a size and height. Another term have been trying out for a cell is a "2D register". So like we have 1-dimensional 64-bit registers, you'd have 2-dimensional 8x8 bit registers.

I'll define a line and plane (using roughly the same meanings as from geometry). A Tree is a line and a plane that starts on the line below it, indented.  That might not be too clear but I've made a github issue with your feedback for the next revision. Thanks!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@breck7</span> Looking forward to the next iteration. Your last paragraph is a lot clearer than the current blog post.<br/>BTW, a more general source of confusion is that you don't explain the relation between the cell universe and the tree universe. My initial impression of tree notation is that it's all about trees, as the name implies. Trees can of course be used to encode pretty much anything (which I think is the main contribution of Lisp), including any type of cell universe. If that's what you are doing, please say so. Otherwise I wonder what role cells do play in tree notation, given that the main Web site does not use the term.

Thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Konrad Hinsen</span> ! That is a good point, that cells are not talked about much yet throughout the rest of the Tree stuff. I haven't yet shown how you can build new types of hardware for directly executing Tree Language code, and that's where the cells will come in in a big way. Cells I think now only come up in Tree Language code (cells are placeholder for words and provide types, you'll see a "cells" keyword in the Tree Language called Grammar)...but the 2D register bit and "tree machines" is where this paper is headed, long term...

Thank you all for the feedback on this! Just updated it incorporating this feedback. Perhaps this will provide a perspective that makes things click for some small percentage of people. Perhaps not. I think next post might be a post about the broader class of spatial notations.
