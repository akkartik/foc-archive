        "text": "There are some expectations on each medium, slack favors ad-hoc short bursts that spark discussions and are kind of ephemeral. This incentivizes throwing raw ideas and seeing what generates feedback. Blogs and mailing lists (at least for me) are for medium\/long form \"cooked\" ideas with structure and objective, mailing lists also favor asking questions (after researching a little bit), in slack\/twitter usually you throw the question as a starter and then maybe you start researching and sharing what you find.\n\nAll of this to say that I think we may need more than one medium, one for ad-hoc, raw ideas, questions and then migrate to the other or summarize it there for history. I wouldn't just write an idea, dumb question or paste a tweet or a link on a mailing list, forum or a blog. Sometimes thos raw, small things without a clear objective spark interesting discussions that show the limits of slack, in that case, having something else would be nice for many reasons. \/rant",

This incentivizes throwing raw ideas and seeing what generates feedback. Blogs and mailing lists (at least for me) are for medium\/long form \"cooked\" ideas with structure and objective, mailing lists also favor asking questions (after researching a little bit), in slack\/twitter usually you throw the question as a starter and then maybe you start researching and sharing what you find.\n\nAll of this to say that I think we may need more than one medium, one for ad-hoc, raw ideas, questions and then migrate to the other or summarize it there for history. I wouldn't just write an idea, dumb question or paste a tweet or a link on a mailing list, forum or a blog. Sometimes thos raw, small things without a clear objective spark interesting discussions that show the limits of slack, in that case, having something else would be nice for many reasons. \/rant"
