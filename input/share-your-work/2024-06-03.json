These message objects would be hosted symmetrically across the devices of the users participating in the chat.\n2. *Paragraphs and Images*: The individual paragraphs and images within each message would also be 3D world objects, linked to the message object. These atomic content elements could be hosted on any of the user devices participating in the chat, or even on separate servers.\n3. *Linking*: All of these chat elements - messages, paragraphs, images - would be linked together using the advanced 3D linking system of the Parallel Reality. This allows users to seamlessly navigate, reference, and interact with the chat content, regardless of where the individual elements are hosted.\n4. *Permissions*: Each user would have control over the read and write permissions for the world objects they have hosted on their local device. This allows for fine-grained control over who can access and modify the chat content.\n5. *Synchronization*: The Parallel Reality operating system would handle the synchronization of the chat content across all participating devices, ensuring a seamless and consistent experience for all users.\nIn summary, the decentralized and linked nature of the Parallel Reality allows for a chat system where the individual elements are hosted flexibly across the user devices and servers, while still providing a cohesive and interactive experience through the advanced 3D linking capabilities.",
