The LLM generates a block-based, visual, domain-specific constraint logic program based on the text of the law and the ontology defined by the user, then you encode a question and an interview and you have a chatbot that doesn't have the black box problem of LLMs, but has the same easy interface. Very interested in anyone's comments.",
