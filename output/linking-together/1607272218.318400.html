Most of the time, visual programming are programmed with text language, but sometime it is the other way around: like a text language engine implemented in a block programming environment.<br/><br/>That is the purpose of CRIS, which means "CRIS Runs In Scratch".<br/><br/>This is a language designed by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Greg8128/">Greg8128</a>, "a 17 year old Scratcher who enjoys Mathematics and Computer Science". The language itself is in the C-like family, with memory management, namespace, function pointers, scope... And basic text and graphics output.<br/><br/>According to the author, it is not the first attempt to create a text programming language from Scratch but "compared to previous attempts, CRIS is much faster and much more feature rich".<br/><br/>Something I find very interesting here, is that a language seen as "serious" by some people ("prog lang have to be text languages") is created with a programming environment seen as a "toy" ("programming with Scratch is not real programming").<br/><br/>Here is the Scratch project with the compiler and the engine: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/451789561/">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/451789561/</a><br/><br/>Here is the documentation: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/the-cris-programming-language/documentation">https://sites.google.com/view/the-cris-programming-language/documentation</a>

&gt; The <tt>while</tt> statement allows code to be repeated, much like a <tt>repeat until</tt> block in Scratch.<br/>Statements like this (pg 8 ) in the documentation make it seem like it may help ease Scratch programmers into mainstream text languages. Most interesting.<br/><br/>Is it easy to see the generated Scratch program? I couldn't tell from within the Scratch project.

It doesn't generate a Scratch program. He has written a compiler/engine/interpreter of the CRIS language. I guess there is some kind of intermediate representation generated by the compiler that is used by the engine.
