        "text": "I agree that “Future of Coding” is not a perfect name, although it’s one I’ve come to accept as the least bad option I can think of. “Coding” has a lot of connotations that I think are appropriate for this community and its interests:\n1. “Coding” is often a term used by people who are not professional software developers, and _to me_ it conveys the spirit of novices. I personally observe experienced software developers using the word “coding” less often than people newer to or outside of the conventional definition of “programming” used by that group. (For example, I think annoying people obsessed with what constitutes a “real programming language” have fewer objections to writing HTML being “coding” vs. “programming”. Not that we should pick a name based on what these people think)\n2. “Coding” centers a particular style of instructing computers — currently by manipulating highly structured text —  that this community is interested in analyzing, criticizing, and proposing alternatives to. It also centers _the act of instruction_ as opposed to any other considerations involved in producing software. “Programming” or “Software Engineering” connote things beyond the medium. IMHO, this community is _most_ interested in criticizing the medium, though it often involves branching out into how changing the medium has implications for thinking about the computation itself. For example, better testing definitely falls under the purview of software engineering, but I think would be only marginally relevant to this community?\n3. “Future of Computing” seems far too broad to me. Computing involves so many more things beyond the part where you instruct a computer what to do. Are new CPU designs FoComputing? Theory of computation?  While I think those things may be interesting and relevant _sometimes_, I think looking around this Slack and the podcast it’s evident that this is not what folks seem to mean most of the time by “computing”.\nComing at “Human Computer Interaction” from a different angle (current HCI PhD student), I think it’s not a very appropriate term — the HCI community is engaged in _much more_ beyond instructing computers to do things, or even “interaction”. It’s also a pretty unfamiliar term to most people, even those very immersed in studying computing. I suspect that using HCI in the name would not have the intended effect.\n\n_Coding_ can also refer to <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Coding_(social_sciences)?wprov=sfti1|the assignment of ><https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Coding_(social_sciences)?wprov=sfti1|categories to observations in the social sciences>. This actually comes up a lot in academic HCI and is briefly confusing to me every time I read it. But I don’t think this is a thing most people would think “Future of Coding” means.\n\nAll of that said, I love Felienne Hermans’ paper and I definitely agree it’s worth examining whether the name is potentially communicating the wrong thing! So while I currently think that the name is reasonably evocative and clearly communicates what people in this community are doing (criticizing the current text-dominated medium for instructing computers to do things), I’m still open to there being a better name out there.",

I seem to recall there was a strong reason we couldn't use it...\n\nHowever, in defense of \"coding\": literally all information outside the dang Platonic Realm, and maybe the quantum information of fundamental particles, is encoded in some sense or other. This is especially obvious with anything related to computers. C code is an encoding of some intent. So is a mouse gesture, in a sense, which becomes relevant when you start thinking about the aforementioned recorded UI actions. A network of Excel formulas is _definitely_ code in this perspective.\n\nIt's not an accident that we use an admittedly broad term like \"coding\" for the instructions we give a computer. It's just a machine, and while we've built towers of languages from binary to GUI, we still have to think about how our intent maps to those \"languages\", because the full extent of the machine's functionality is to interpret those encodings. Personally this notion of encoding human intent into computer form(s) is core to my approach. Granted it may be lost on newcomers. Mostly what I'm saying is that \"coding\" is not a wrong term for what we do here.\n\n(I particularly object to equivocating between _encoding_ and _encrypting_. Encryption is deliberate obfuscation, and is optional. Encoding _can_ include obfuscation, but must exist regardless.)",

I seem to recall there was a strong reason we couldn't use it...\n\nHowever, in defense of \"coding\": literally all information outside the dang Platonic Realm, and maybe the quantum information of fundamental particles, is encoded in some sense or other. This is especially obvious with anything related to computers. C code is an encoding of some intent. So is a mouse gesture, in a sense, which becomes relevant when you start thinking about the aforementioned recorded UI actions. A network of Excel formulas is "

It's just a machine, and while we've built towers of languages from binary to GUI, we still have to think about how our intent maps to those \"languages\", because the full extent of the machine's functionality is to interpret those encodings. Personally this notion of encoding human intent into computer form(s) is core to my approach. Granted it may be lost on newcomers. Mostly what I'm saying is that \"coding\" is not a wrong term for what we do here.\n\n(I particularly object to equivocating between "
