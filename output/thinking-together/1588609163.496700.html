&gt; i am only too familiar with internet security flaws. However, it is the basic protocols of the internet that are at fault, not how they are implemented.<br/>In order to understand the cause of internet security bugs, you need to look at the actual bug reports, and at the code where the bug occurs. See <a href="http://cve.mitre.org">cve.mitre.org</a> and the twitter feed @CVEnew. The majority of these bugs are the result of coding in an unsafe language. When I was working in the network security industry, the unsafe language was usually C, and the bugs were buffer overflows, use-after-free bugs, etc: these are vulnerabilities that would be prevented by coding in a safe language. Today, a lot of network exposed code is written in higher level languages than C, but the code continues to be full of security holes. It's not commonly understood why these higher level languages are unsafe. I'm going to arbitrarily look at today's latest CVE, which is &lt;<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12641">https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12641</a>&gt;. This bug "allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters in a configuration setting for im_convert_path or im_identify_path". The bug is a result of executing bash code, and bash is an inherently unsafe language (ie, it is not pure functional). The problem here is that you can embed "$(cmd)" sequences in any bash argument, and this will execute a command that can have arbitrary side effects. In a pure functional language, evaluating a string-valued expression <b>cannot</b> have side effects.
