I think if you can build something with a tool that gets people 200K-500K salaries (or more) if they learn how to us it effectively then it will become the "one thing" programmers use over time, even if that thing looked like a toy at first, the trick is to get there you need to get hobbyists, kids and maybe entrepreneurs to adopt it.  Another option is to dictate that its the "official" option for an important platform or environment.
