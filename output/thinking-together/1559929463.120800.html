The lesson I learned from Chris Granger is that non-programmers get into trouble if you encourage them to use abstraction mechanisms. Nested scopes and all that. Decomposing a program into modules with information hiding and well designed interfaces is <b>hard</b>. Users are happy to use a flat programming model where all of their data is globally accessible. Granger mentioned an example of a user that built a single large spreadsheet (multiple gigabytes) modelling an entire company. The node and wire style of visual programming language that I mentioned is compatible with a flat programming model. You just need a zoomable interface that can handle large numbers of nodes.
