I often click on things and nothing happens. Or I scroll up to find the browser unloaded the top of the page, and it takes seconds for it to come back. The whole thing feels just _janky_. And this form is included in the spec:\n\n&gt; A reusable and reactive visualization widget should be.. a function that returns.. an HTML Element.\nSurely a neat idea like this should be tech-independent?\n\nThe web and web browsers are often held up as having accessibility benefits, but I often find complex pages to have poor accessibility. And if you don't have that, then I wish I could just go implement such charts in a plain canvas and be compliant with the spec.\n\n&gt; developing visualization software tends to be an overwhelming task.\nEach of the examples in my link above requires less than 100 lines of code. I'll suggest a lot of the overwhelm here is accidental complexity that stems from tech choices.",
