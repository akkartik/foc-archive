HELLO! I am Laura Brekelmans, 29 years old and from the Netherlands.<br/>I'm a professional software engineer, and <a href="https://laura.fm/generative-art.php">I sometimes dabble in creative coding</a>.<br/><br/>I also published some articles<br/><br/>• <a href="https://laura.fm/generative-art/heart-deconstruction/techniques.html">This one</a> where I deconstruct a generative art piece by Terebus Volodymyr is still my favorite published work of all time. (note, doesn't work on mobile! Whoops)<br/>• A few years ago I also published <a href="https://github.com/Azeirah/A-new-wave-of-programming">an article on the future of coding</a> myself which was somewhat popular at the time.<br/>My interest in the future of coding emerged when I discovered Bret Victor's work about a decade ago at this point (woah). Ever since that I dove deep into history of computer science, have consumed hundreds of hours of Alan Kay, Ted Nelson, Bret Victor, Douglas Engelbart, HARC, Viewpoints research institute, Dan Ingalls, Bill Buxton etcetcetc.<br/>I'm also somewhat active on the <a href="https://github.com/ohmjs/ohm">Ohm Discord</a>, I think that community might have some overlap with this one! Ohm is a library as well as an ecosystem of tools to make grammars and programming languages.<br/><br/>I often have ideas for meaningful or interesting new ways of doing programming or interacting with programming tools, but I never really felt like I had the room for these ideas to grow larger so not much has come of it (so far!)<br/>When I was still a student I was really active making codepens, generative art, programming language experiments, blog posts and <a href="https://laura.fm/generative-art/wind/wind.html">even entire programs</a> <em>as part of a conversation to other programs</em> just because I thought it was cool. A bit later I got into a really deep depression and I've kind of lost my mojo, but I'm sort of trying to find it back again? I've since recovered, gladly, but I'm still feeling the discrepancy between how creative and active I was back then. I hope by joining this community I can reignite some of that passion again :c<br/><br/>I <em>think</em> I learned about this community through Lu Wilson, who has also been really inspiring for me the past year. Thank you for doing your thing Lu!<br/><br/>Edit: Oh and I forgot, I'm working on <a href="https://github.com/Azeirah/ma">a realtalk implementation in JS</a> called <em>ma</em> which is available on Github. It's very very early in development, I just work on it every now and then. It's mostly meant for fun, but it works.
