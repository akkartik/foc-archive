Hey guys, here is the full process of solving a sorting problem with MockMechanics. I tried to make a video that's more fun to watch, more "show" less "tell". Any feedback on the new format, length, pacing, etc? Do you prefer the legends to the voiceover? Was anything unclear?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2XgcpGitmM&amp;ab_channel=MockMechanics">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2XgcpGitmM&amp;ab_channel=MockMechanics</a>

I liked it, although it was a little hard to follow. Definitely had a little "aha" moment at 6:20 when the switch finally worked :grinning:<br/><br/>I think the best-in-class for this type of video is Ben Eater. Here's his latest one - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUTHtNrpwiI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUTHtNrpwiI</a><br/><br/>I think he edits it so that it seems like it is live but I am sure he actually carefully scripts and narrates over it. He leaves the little mistakes in (as you did) because I think they are important for understanding.<br/><br/>So basically I think it should still have voiceover but you should also edit/condense it. Stuff like changing colours (which still takes quite a long time, but is conceptually boring) can be whisked past.<br/><br/>Other stuff, I think you need to signpost ahead of time what you are intending to do, then do, then show it working. Like: "Ok, now I'm going to try and make this platform move backwards when I flip the button. First, I'm going to need...". This will help follow the design thought process.<br/><br/>(Personal preference but I also found the music kind of annoying, especially when it changed)<br/><br/>All in all, a really great project, will follow closely!

Thanks Chris, great feedback, I especially liked the signpost idea. I didn't like the music much either but I was experimenting to see if people prefer the videos without my voice (I do have an accent and personally I find videos with accents a little annoying) and I had to put something in its place. I thought about speeding up the boring parts but I thought maybe some people would like to follow along and wouldn't like me to skip anything. Maybe I can solve that problem with just the highlights slowed down on youtube and a full normal speed video on patreon, it could even earn me a bit, we'll see. Thanks again, very good points.

5:14 I'm not sure what you mean by "the probes of the platforms interfere with each other", since the system apparently seems happy to allow two objects to occupy the same space at the same time.<br/><br/>I would say that the video would be easier to understand if I knew more about the basic principles of the system, like which laws of physics (if any) it follows, and what each component is capable of doing. And yeah, Chris's feedback is good.<br/><br/>In any case it's very cool that you can implement a sorting algorithm in this manner.
