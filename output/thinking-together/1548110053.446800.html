I finally got round to listening to "The Edges of Representation" podcast ep. <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span>, you were asking about papers on notations and <em>'Cognitive Dimensions'</em> came up. A paper in a similar vein that I've found useful is Daniel Moody's <em>'The “Physics” of Notations: Towards a Scientific Basis for Constructing Visual  Notations in Software Engineering</em>  <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/docs/vakken/arm/literature/Moody2009-DesignScience.pdf">http://www.cs.uu.nl/docs/vakken/arm/literature/Moody2009-DesignScience.pdf</a><br/><br/>Quoting PoN as to where it fits in the literature:<br/><em>"The  Physics  of  Notations  incorporates  both  a  Type  IV  theory  (Section  3)  and  a  Type  V  theory  (Section  4),  which  are  higher  evolutionary forms than the CDs framework (Type I). However it should not be seen as a direct competitor for the CDs frame-work as its scope is much more modest (visual notations rather than  cognitive  artifacts).  Instead,  it  should  be  seen  as  complementary:  it  provides  exactly  the  type  of  detailed,  domain-specific analysis that the authors of the CDs framework argued was  necessary  to  supplement  the  “broad  brush”  analysis  provided  by  CDs"</em><br/><br/>Type 1: Theory for analyzing<br/>Type 4: Theory for predicting and explaining<br/>Type 5: Theory for design and action<br/><br/><br/><em>(Aside: while trying to find the PDF for this again, I came across a paper looking at using it directly for visual programming language analysis: <em>Towards an Operationalization of the “Physics of Notations” for the Analysis of Visual Languages</em> (Storrle &amp; Fish) <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d4bc/b466b1390295354d0cc897ab02058f2f8cad.pdf">https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d4bc/b466b1390295354d0cc897ab02058f2f8cad.pdf</a>)</em><br/><br/>I used PoN when writing my undergrad dissertation on improving the notation for a human factors tool/diagramming thing (somewhat similar to UML) representing human tasks. Some crossover, although not exactly the same as your likely use. IIRC it illustrates putting PoN to use. I can probably dig it up if you're interested?
