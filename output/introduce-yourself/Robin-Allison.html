Hi everyone! My name is Robin Allison. I want to understand stuff. I studied pure math in undergrad and grad school for a year. I studied math because I could get it and obsessed over algebraic topology because more than any other subject because I couldn't get it. That wasn't good for my career but its given me a unique perspective on math and I'm grateful for that. I read Michael Nielsen's essay "Reinventing Explanation" which eventually let me understand Bret Victor. I came to the conclusion that my understanding was limited by the representations we used, and that by inventing my own I could better understand.<br/><br/>I've had two personal victories, one with spectral sequences and one with the proof of the cellular boundary, in designing better representations using static media. I'm working on better representing the computation of the homology of the projective plane using the decomposition RP^2 = e^2 \cup e^1 \cup e^0, extending the previous techniques. I hope that these "prototypes" can convince other mathematicians the merits and unexplored possibilities of design, leaving aside the possibilities of dynamic media. Additionally I speculate heavily on how we interface with mathematical ideas, motivated by whats probably considered low working memory and expressive language capabilities for math.<br/><br/>In my experience it is extremely difficult to get other mathematicians to think about the kinds of ideas talked about here. I think part of the problem is that the solution is outside of math whereas for coding at least the solution is still code and has a historical basis in the work of Alan Kay etc.  So I hope I can hang out here until mathematics expands to consider "design" a part of math too. :slightly_smiling_face:
