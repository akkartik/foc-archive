Over the last year I've spent a lot of time outside my area of expertise, mining some seemingly unrelated fields for inspiring ideas that can be combined with what we try to do here. One particularly deep rabbit hole I fell into was linguistics. As I'm slowly climbing my way back up into our world, I started trying to put some of the insights I bring with me from down there into a blog series.<br/><br/>My goal is to make some of the concepts I learned about more accessible to us designing and developing software. I think there is a lot that can be useful for dreaming up and building a more humane and democratized future of programming.<br/><br/>I start with very basic stuff, and go slowly, so there isn't much yet. I also try to keep the posts short (500-1000 words, ~3-6 minutes reading time). There are three of them right now, and you can start here: <a href="https://stefan-lesser.com/2019/12/06/structure-and-behavior/">https://stefan-lesser.com/2019/12/06/structure-and-behavior/</a><br/><br/>Would love to hear what you think. Thank you!

Oh!  A direction I went for a while.  If we had had the wide Web and corpus statistics like we do now, I might have stayed.  As is the only interesting things were transformational grammar and Montague semantics, I moved into Philosophy and Logic.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@William Taysom</span> Maybe you can help me understand the <em>linguistics wars</em> better… did you come across the generative grammar vs. semantics divide? I'm obviously totally new to the field and just had the opportunity to discuss this with one linguist, but it seems to me that Lakoff's work (what I'm mostly into) is still today considered quite controversial. Did you ever get into the cognitive side of things at all?

&gt; "The first is something we didn't know before, that neural codings of ideas, at least for concrete nouns, are remarkably similar in our different heads. They're not identical. We are different. But the amazing thing is that they're similar enough that these modeling procedure can extrapolate from one person to another.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; "The second thing is that you can predict the neural activity in your brain when you think about a word based on how that word is used on the web. That's exactly what this model is doing. The input to this model is "how is this word used on the web" and the output of the model is the predicted neural activity. And it works. So, there's something fundamental about semantics that's captured in corpus statistics."

I think you are approaching it with the correct philosophy. Certainly there is no need for most of the ceremony in programming today. If you think of programming as a linguistic system that is similar to human languages, there are only a few hundred verbs total in the english language, and people only use about 100 of them, and then there are vast numbers of nouns, and then various other parts of speech, and punctuation. Programming languages, the verbs are typically in the syntax of the language, and the nouns are the names we give to all the different variables and functions. One can see in modern systems that the biggest burden of learning is the supporting library API functions. In OSX there are probably 10,000 API's you can call. A vast space that is very difficult to learn.  MS .NET has thousands as well. And since the API's have to be used in proper sequence, there is a massive amount of learning in every framework. You can read a newspaper in Chinese once you learn about 2000 characters, even though the total set is 50,000.  Same with API's; you can build quite a few products with a small set, but knowing which ones to study first is not obvious to a beginner.

I like the idea of the need to "abolish the ceremony". I know you talk about ceremony about programming/managing data, but one can extend it to other kind of ceremony around acts of programming. Which sometime is not essentially necessary but is the result of the culture. Like the use of commands in terminals with dark background and flashy characters and no margin. I see programmers that need this to feel good even if it can be seen as terrible in some UI/UX sense. And young people see this as the ritual to become a real programmer.

With your third article I discovered the category approach in linguistics. And it is interesting to draw a parallel with programming. At least knowing that our mind is a kind of "catorygizer" is helpful in designing tools for thoughts and especially for building those tools with programming.

And if you read French, I recommand this book by <b>Gilles Dowek</b> (a french computer scientist and philosopher) : <b>"Ce dont on ne peut parler, il faut l’écrire"</b>. Let me try to translate the title: "what you can't tell by speaking you have to tell by writing" (hope it is close enough to te Dowek idea!).<br/><br/>It is a very interesting book wich compares natural languages to other languages. In fact in French we have two separate words: "langues" are natural languages (English, French...) and "languages" are all other languages (math notations, music scores, programming languages...).<br/><br/>Natural languages were first spoken before written, and others were create to write stuff that benefit in expressivness when written. In fact writing was "invented" not to write down what humans were talking about, but to count things, it was a very utilitarian use. It helped us a lot in the action of counting and doing business.<br/><br/>I found very inspiring the separation of the two kinds of languages, and what is different and similar.

From feedback here and through other channels I can already tell that I focused too much on the linguistics aspect of it. As you will hopefully see soon in the coming articles, I'm much more interested in the cognition part of it, so I should probably talk about cognitive science instead of linguistics to prevent people to come to the wrong conclusions before I even get started with the interesting bits.<br/><br/>In other words, if you think I'll be talking about generative linguistics and all the well-understood parallels to information theory and computer science, there's a major plot twist incoming. :wink:

This is also the part I am interest in. :slightly_smiling_face: And as for your first three articles, I guess one can already see (at least I do) that the focus is more on the way the mind is working.
