Back a long, long while ago, I was introducing colleagues (mostly Java and C++ experienced) to the \"new\" crop of dynamic languages (Lua, Ruby, JavaScript, and Python).  To a first approximation, these languages are all of the same sort of imperative ALGOL\/C type.   At the second  approximation, you get the static\/dynamic split.  Beyond that, yes, you have Lua's simplicity in contrast to Ruby's semantic potpourri — why have functions when you can have blocks, procs, lambdas, methods, and eigen methods?  However, take Ruby vs Python, which aren't all that different except for having nearly zero culture overlap and an entirely different aesthetic sense.",

Back a long, long while ago, I was introducing colleagues (mostly Java and C++ experienced) to the \"new\" crop of dynamic languages (Lua, Ruby, JavaScript, and Python).  To a first approximation, these languages are all of the same sort of imperative ALGOL\/C type.   At the second  approximation, you get the static\/dynamic split.  Beyond that, yes, you have Lua's simplicity in contrast to Ruby's semantic potpourri — why have functions when you can have blocks, procs, lambdas, methods, and eigen methods?  However, take Ruby vs Python, which aren't all that different except for having nearly zero culture overlap and an entirely different aesthetic sense."
