There are also really different goals and use cases for these projects. On the other hand, the fact that these projects are going to be open source, and built with a desire for hackability \/ kit-bashing, means they'll surely be interconnected in some way. A lot of folks have mentioned the desire to take a slack conversation and tie it to a wiki article in a way that goes slightly beyond just hyperlinking. Dunno what that'll look like, but I'm keen to see it.\n\nYeah, we'll definitely get a search at some point. I just don't want to block on that for the initial release.\n\nMasonry, plus some tighter spacing (maybe get rid of the implied \"button\"-ness on hover) would definitely let us squeeze in 1 or 2 more links on narrow phones*. That's why I'm eager to figure out how many links we'll need. If it's 1 or 2 more, great — masonry it is! If it's 10 more, then we'll need something different.\n\nAnyway, thank you for the feedback and suggestions!\n\n(* Yes, I realize that phones don't have hover, and so it's probably silly to keep that behaviour on the narrow layout.
