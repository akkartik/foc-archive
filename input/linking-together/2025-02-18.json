What's missing for programming is a feedback loop that motivates experts to care about beginner's issues. Education fills this role in other fields. That's one reason why universities have combined research with teaching for centuries. Why does mechanism fail for programming?",

I tend to attribute this to endemic short-term thinking.\n\nI love the idea of (1) focusing on data first and in particular (2) version control for data.\n\nThe expert vs. beginner problem exists in some form for all technologies. What's missing for programming is a feedback loop that motivates experts to care about beginner's issues. Education fills this role in other fields. That's one reason why universities have combined research with teaching for centuries. Why does mechanism fail for programming?"
