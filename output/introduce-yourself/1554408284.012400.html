Hey folks, I'm Jeremy. I'm based in Ottawa, ON, Canada. Been listening to the podcast off and on for a while, don't remember how I found it.<br/>I've been programming since I was 4 years old using BASIC on a Commodore Vic-20. My career as a developer has been kind of all over the map, but the relevant detail for this crowd is that I got very excited about DSLs in the early 2000s and went to work at Intentional Software for five and a half years (2006-2011).<br/>I also run a game-making community at <a href="http://glorioustrainwrecks.com">glorioustrainwrecks.com</a>, where the guiding ethos is to be creative and expressive without gatekeeping or judgement about your choice of tools, game mechanics, or subject matter. Tiny, weird, and personal games are the norm, to the extent there is a norm. Hyper-accessible game-making tools like Klik &amp; Play and Twine deserve to be talked about in the same breath as Hypercard IMO.<br/>In general, my main interest at this point is empowering ordinary people; computing should be understandable, accessible, personal, collaborative, and in the direct control of the people who use it. When I was a kid, I was surrounded by tools that were designed to be learnable by people who had never touched a keyboard, and resources that encouraged me that understanding computers was not only possible, but fun and rewarding. To the extent that improving programming can advance that goal, I am on board.
