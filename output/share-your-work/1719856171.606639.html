Been a while since I touched it but I've been <a href="https://github.com/cben/animation-stack-language">building</a> a toy postfix stack-based language to inflict upon my kids.  My theory is:<br/>• postfix may have benefits for early teaching (linear evaluation order, lack of "syntax", trivial notional machine)<br/>• the obvious drawbacks can be somewhat mitigated if instead of destructively changing the stack, you can navigate all previous stack states.  (I'm not the first to try the latter; in particular Kartik did it in Mu, including descending into function calls. I don't even have user-defined functions yet.)<br/>• I wanted to explore "replacing" some uses of control structures with composition of a bigger data type, like a whole picture or animation.  <br/>I'm resigned to the thing not being turing-complete.<br/><br/>Initial implementation's data type was 1D "animation" of color change (I wanted them to program an RGB lamp): <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/zObMq9ZLJQNA99X3EhdEDllhA">https://asciinema.org/a/zObMq9ZLJQNA99X3EhdEDllhA</a><br/>=> My kids liked typing and mixing colors, but the idea of a single value representing change over time went entirely over their heads :disappointed:<br/>Anyway terminal REPL was a dead end, because you can't go back and edit past code.  => I got a prototype web editor — you can move cursor, edit freely, and see stack state before each word: <a href="https://animation-stack-language.netlify.app/">https://animation-stack-language.netlify.app/</a><br/>TODO: rendering still uses styled block characters :technologist:, I need to learn canvas...<br/><br/>TODO: Next big step will be to replace the data type from 1D "time" to 2D "picture", taking inspiration from <a href="http://forthsalon.appspot.com">forthsalon.appspot.com</a> and <a href="https://code.world/">code.world </a>.<br/>I'm thinking to make do with some 2D rather than RGB colorspace, so that every pixel can also be interpreted as a vector.  That way any picture doubles as a limited representation of function-as-data (not turing-complete! but very visual :thinking_face:).
