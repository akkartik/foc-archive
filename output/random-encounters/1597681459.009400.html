<b>Welcome to #random-encounters!</b><br/><br/>This channel gives community members a fun way to connect and get to know one another. Every so often, you'll be paired up with one other random person in this channel, via our friendly neighbourhood <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Donut</span> bot. You and your pair can schedule a zoom call, or just chat via DMs. These pairings should happen about once per month on average, though the schedule will fluctuate a bit (since we're on the Donut free plan, so we're dealing with some limitations).<br/><br/>• If you're ever paired with someone who is a no-show, you can click a button in the message you receive from Donut to request a different partner. You might want to tell me you had a no-show so I can remove them from the channel (presumably because they're no longer visiting the Slack).<br/>• You might be paired more frequently than once per month, or you might go for multiple months without a pairing. If that's the case, shoot me a DM and I'll see if I can get straightened out.<br/>• No need to wait for Donut to generate a pairing for you. Feel free to post here in the channel if you're looking for folks to chat with (though please take those social chats to DMs — this channel is for organizing chats, not actually having the chats).<br/>• And of course, if you ever have an interaction that feels bad or breaks the <a href="https://github.com/futureofcoding/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>, please let me know.<br/>The next round of pairs will be sent out Monday, August 24th. See you then!
