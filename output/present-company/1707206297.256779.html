I'm <b>looking for the first team member</b> for a natural language programming startup I've been working on since the beginning of 2021: <a href="https://levlo.com">https://levlo.com</a>.<br/>The responsibilities can be defined based on experience and interests to fit somewhere between passionate frontend developer + designer and full-stack developer + product owner/chief product officer.<br/><br/>I live in Espoo, Finland, but we'd work mostly full-remote. However, due to bureaucracy, residence in Finland is required. Atm I have funding for 12 months of 4200â‚¬/month salary (with working time and benefits as defined by Finnish law) and will be offering equity on top. The goal is certainly to find funding for paying the salary going forward as well.<br/><br/>Since releasing the demo shown on the site, I've been working on rewritting large parts of the underlaying technology to be able to add features required by potential use-cases that have come up. Now, after ~5 months, I've finally been able to start adding those language features and start work towards enabling real world use-cases. Sales effort hase been fairly minimal so far, but I have one confirmed pilot customer (B2B) and will be putting more effort into sales going forward.<br/><br/>The techstack is C#, Azure and Blazor (similar to Vue). The most important skills would be web frontend development (& design), cloud (Azure), and C#. In that order. The C# you'll need to write will be fairly trivial and it should be easy for anyone familiar with eg. Java or TypeScript to pick it up. But first and foremost I'm looking for someone passionate about the future of programming willing to embark on this hopefully decades long journey with me!

How do you validate your design choices?

Do you mean language design? I had a mini user test with couple non-programmers building a porridge ingredients calculator while I watched, which worked out surprisingly well tbh. But mostly the language design has come out of my intuition and is therefore not yet validated to be something that would be intuitive for non-programmers and there will definitely be need for user testing. 90% of my time so far has gone into building the underlying technology which will allow rapid development and iteration on language designs, so changing things based on user feedback is certainly possible.

Posted on linkedin about this as well.
