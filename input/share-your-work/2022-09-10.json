Will also share it here in that case.\n\nWhat I can share is this:\n• We're intentionally editing and executing TypeScript since that allows us to tap into existing code bases and ecosystems, including open source. We want teams to just be able to have designers jump into existing code bases.\n• Relatedly, we didn't invent a new programming language, which means that the work done by the TypeScript team in their language service and compiler APIs is available for us to build on\n• We're able to use two-way Git since any code reads\/edits we do eventually end up as the same text files that your IDE manipulates today.",
