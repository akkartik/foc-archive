<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Joel Jakubovic</span> While getting out of there may be the right idea long-term, if you want to focus on improving your current situation, there’s a lot you can do with communication and precision. Your coworkers may be more reasonable than you realize.<br/><br/>Many people who shoot down proposals prematurely will respond better if you find common ground and make them want you to succeed, if you approach them 1-on-1 and get input early, etc. Those who jump to “this is overengineering” can be convinced if you can explain exactly what’s involved and exactly what future scenarios  each choice will help/fail in, especially if you have a track record of successful prediction; one of my clients reported this happening.<br/><br/>On overengineering: I recommend “What is Overengineering” by Max Kanat-Alexander.

Thanks, I'll think on this advice. I have tried to do this before, in a "testing the waters" type way, but I would always quickly realise that what I had in mind was too vague for me to put into words, which kinda made me give up on trying to communicate them. Writing on my blog helps them solidify, when I can. But only a small amount of it relates to things that come up at work. But it is important that I persevere on verbal communication, even though it's been really hard. I wish there were some training examples I could watch / read over and over again :stuck_out_tongue:
