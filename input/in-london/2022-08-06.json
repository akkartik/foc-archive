It’s also hard to find a pub that will host 30+ people without charging a _lot_ for event space so I have to cap it.\n\nYou’re more than welcome to come along to one of the future ones! I’m hosting them every month at the moment. There’s always space available a week or two before the event, but they tend to fill up as the date gets closer. We also have cancellations so last-minute spots open up as well.\n\nFeel free to sign up for the september event - <https:\/\/lu.ma\/f2gwr5az>\n\nLooking forward to meeting you soon",
