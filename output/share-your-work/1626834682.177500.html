:satellite_antenna: <b>Future of Coding • Episode 51</b><br/><br/><b>Toby Schachman • Cuttle, Apparatus, and Recursive Drawing</b><br/><br/>In this episode, I'll be talking to <a href="https://twitter.com/mandy3284">Toby Schachman</a>, who many of you are surely familiar with thanks to an <a href="http://tobyschachman.com/">incredible string of projects</a> he's released over the past decade, including <a href="http://recursivedrawing.com/">Recursive Drawing</a> back in 2012, <a href="http://aprt.us/">Apparatus</a> in 2015, and most recently <a href="https://cuttle.xyz/">Cuttle</a> which opened to the public this past week. All of these projects superficially appear to be graphics editors, but by interacting with them you actually create <em>a program</em> that generates graphics. Their interfaces are wildly different from both traditional programming tools and traditional graphics apps. If you are not familiar with these projects, I strongly recommend that you actually go and play them (they all run in the browser), or watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3Xack9ufYk">Strange Loop talk</a> where Toby demos Apparatus and explains the thinking behind it.<br/><br/>(And if Toby's work still doesn't ring any bells — he was also at Dynamicland, and CDG before that. Heavy hitter!)<br/><br/>This episode was sponsored by <a href="https://www.glideapps.com/">Glide</a>, and the transcript was sponsored by <a href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a> — thanks to them both for making this possible!<br/><br/>The show notes and transcript are available right here: <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/051">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/051</a><br/><br/>Meta-commentary in the thread.

This episode was really weird to make.<br/><br/>I went into it a goal: to push the conversation in unusual directions. Most interviews are just a rote review of the guest's past work. I want to get the FoC podcast away from that. Instead, I'd like the show to be a place where the guest is challenged a bit, where they have to reflect on their work, turn it over, look at it from new angles. I think that'll raise both the hit and miss rate of the interview, but I can cut out the biggest misses in the edit (I've been doing that all along — typically about 10-20 minutes of each recording session never makes it into the episode). I think it'll give the show an interesting energy, something that interview podcasts tend to lack.<br/><br/>Toby... might not have been the best person to try this with. Or maybe he was the best person, it's hard to say. Toby does a thing that I wish more people did — when you ask him a question, he pauses and thinks about it for a good while. Then when he talks, he frequently pauses mid sentence, thinks some more, and then continues. It's a really admirable quality. He had no difficulty calling me on my bullshit, whenever I posed a question with inbuilt assumptions that needn't apply.<br/><br/>But... this meant a lot of dead air. A lot! So in the moment, recording with him, thinking to myself "I'm trying to push this podcast in weird directions", confronted with this copious dead air, I found myself dreading "Oh no, I've pushed too far, this is going badly, this is why nobody does this."<br/><br/>So at the end of the interview, I feared the worst. But, thankfully, after the edit, with most of the dead air tightened-up, I think it came through okay.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's a bit of behind the curtain drama. I'm going to keep pushing myself to get more energy (and weird energy) from the interviews, and we'll see how it goes!

I've played with Descript a bit. It doesn't quite fit with how I like to work, and the transcripts it produced weren't any better than what I get from Rev (read: almost unusably awful). But there's a lot of effort being poured into that tool, so if that holds I'll probably slowly use it for more stuff as time goes on.

I do all my audio editing in Ableton Live, because it's the fastest-feeling audio tool I've ever worked with. (I've recorded around a dozen albums, so.. my list of tools-worked-with is long.) Ironically, it's kinda pokey at podcasts — it's too freeform, where a little bit of additional structure (like what Final Cut gives you, say) would probably make things a go more quickly. But that's a tangent for a whole other thread!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> when I was a guest in a podcast they sent me the topics/questions beforehand to at least think a little about the answers. Do you think it would make it less interesting? do you come up with most questions on the fly? (the ones I was on drifted from the original questions a little too)

An alternative subtractive model to conditionals may be replacement. A recursive drawing where you replace alternate circles with squares, say. But you could build that out of a primitive containing a single circle and square. Hmm, perhaps additive is good enough, and subtractive effects are a matter of tastefully choosing boundaries between primitives.

Every primitive you draw in recursive drawing could be seen as sculpting away all of a layer except for the shapes.

Besides the amazing work of Toby, I found the episode really interesting and didn’t notice any pauses. As an interviewer, your did a lot of preparation / research beforehand which enables a lot of questions that go deeper than usual. I think the interview was very honest und humane. It also gave insights into his thinking, more than just thought out solutions and also provided insights into other communities and tools that some of us might not be aware of. Thank you!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mariano Guerra</span> — I might try sending a few questions in advance; it could help add additional texture to the show. Certainly not all of them, as I love hearing someone go through a realization right in the moment. I come up with questions in advance, but I don't stick strictly to them. I also try to come up with about 2x as many questions as needed, and only ask the ones that would work best in the moment.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Florian Schulz</span> thank you! Yes, I do about 10 hours of prep for each interview, and then about 20 hours of editing after the fact. The pauses are all ironed out in the edit. I'm still learning how to tighten the pacing without making the speech sound unnatural. Getting better, but still not perfect. Same goal as good special effects in film: you shouldn't notice 99% of the work. (Hey, that's a podcast.)

If you watch APL programmers, I think they exhibit a lot of this subtractive thinking. They often start with a solution and then spend time reducing the symbols. Not as a golfing exercise, but for performance and understandability.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> FWIW, it's certainly my experience that Toby has a slow, thoughtful conversational style. That style was the general norm around CDG/Dynamicland when I joined – not sure if it grew lab-to-Toby or Toby-to-lab or both. I came to really appreciate it, but it took some getting used to, and until you're used to it, it can be very uncomfortable. So it makes sense to me that you felt unsure about how the interview went. (I thought it went well.)
