Hi there! I'm Damian,<br/><br/>I'm a professional software developer and a non-professional creative technologist with a background in designing a lot of silly projects for exhibitions, i've got a massive lack of focus, tending to be caught by different whims for creative design based on different projects, finding the right tech to suit certain aspects. I've been quite insular with a lot of my development, especially for festivals, so this year i've been trying to be a bit more open and show off some of my work.<br/><br/>I've realised that there's limits to how much you can learn while being secretive and insular, so really wanted to join a community and connect with others interested in these types of computing! I'm very used to a professional software world where there's a lot less room to play, so it's felt really nice to try and revive some of the passion that brought me into programming in the first place this year.<br/><br/>A couple of my projects:<br/><br/>• <a href="https://nimby.bemben.co.uk/">NimbyDex </a>- a highly insulting gemini agent with GL mapping frontend that attempts to quantify the "NIMBY"ness of cancelled renewable projects in the UK <br/>• <a href="https://sheffield.ac.uk/ideasbazaar/projects/inside-box">Think Inside The Box</a> - an old festival project that used a mixture of AR and VR to create small teaching moments for different engineering disciplines <br/>• 3D prints with LIDAR data to create little mementos + matchbox buildings for smaller venues with loads of charm. This involved getting really in-depth with blender, mapping + python scripting within blender. <br/>I'm definitely very scattered in the stuff that I make, and i've begun this year to finally start doing lots of talks, got recommended this by Hugh Evans who organises AI Signals! I'm also organising a community within Southampton based around creative coding, so wanted to get more properly involved! This seems like a great community!
