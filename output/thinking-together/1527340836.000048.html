Speaking of sums and products, the area that I'm spending my time right now studying is how combinatorial sums and products "magically" turn electrical signals with some gates into a computer that can do anything. I say magically because it still feels like magic to me. I'm starting to get a feel like I'm getting an intuitive feels for it, but I'm still not quite there, though I can feel that it's close.
