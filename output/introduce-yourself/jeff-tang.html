Helloo, I’m Jeff. Been lurking here for a month or so but after reading the community survey transcript I realized I should speak up. You see, my current FoC project is building an <a href="https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/">open-source version of Roam Research</a>, but I’m mainly just doing this to learn Clojure. Why? Because what I really want to make is a chat client built on top of a graph database that supports bi-directional links and multiple indexes (i.e. chronologically of course but <em>also</em> by tags that can organically emerge as channels similar to Zulip).<br/><br/>Conversation is personally my favorite Tool for Thought, but we haven’t quite cracked it digitally. Can we have frictionless divergent streams, but also refined, retrievable evergreen posts? This <a href="../linking-together/1574069038.213900.html#1574674319.319600">message</a> by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mariano Guerra</span> sums it up so well, and I have to agree… I’d be so sad if I never found it! Looking forward to continuing the conversation :wink: here and on <a href="https://twitter.com/tangjeff0">Twitter</a> if you’re into that sort of thing
