I was looking for a definition of "projectional editing" and found that article by Martin Fowler: <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ProjectionalEditing.html">https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ProjectionalEditing.html</a> -- it captures the essence of what I think is the next step in programming language implementation: make the syntax one of the UIs to the program, and make the programming language a complete OO model of its semantics. Pretty much all modern languages have a fairly detailed AST/IR hybrid, but these structures are not designed for interactive editing, they're designed for running transformation passes within the compiler.
