Angelo Pesce, Roblox technical director, shared his live coding framework earlier. Looks <b>a lot</b> like a tool I've been playing with and started independently <a href="https://twitter.com/kenpex/status/1262235296483037184?s=19">https://twitter.com/kenpex/status/1262235296483037184?s=19</a>

Looking at the code he's using all of the IMGUI library's I have been, one nice thing is he has live coded C support via tcc. I've gone back and forth on if I want a full CPU language and what it looks like. I was thinking node based render graph, or maybe Lua, or Fe. TCC might be a good option though

A similar approach to mine too.  I like the C interface though, that is interesting for sure.  I have a similar shader list, though they are tabs in the editor.  I have a scene description format too for mutipass rendering; but I've been thinking about scripting that for more flexibility.  A C interface would be interesting....

It's very experimental and it's not clear from that picture what is special about the tiny 3d editor but for example there is <a href="http://threejs.org/editor">http://threejs.org/editor</a> as an experiment. You can put a function on any object. If you're used to JavaScript <tt>this</tt> is the object the function is on and <tt>event</tt> contains <tt>time</tt> and <tt>deltaTime</tt><br/><br/>I know it's far from complete. Just that it's fairly trivial to throw together a live coding editor at least to start. A hard part becomes handling all the loading and unloading of resources and null pointers etc.<br/><br/>For example you make a script for player and it has a reference to a gun model in the scene graph and then a user selects the gun model and presses delete. You can build a system that handles that but it's not the default. A game engine without tools would generally just have some direct pointer to the gun model in the code controlling the gun. Yes, you can build up a system to handle that but suddenly your easy pointers because some kind of heavy handle. Or you can use a language that can hopefully handle it for you. AFAIK C/C++ is not one of them though.<br/><br/>You've also probably seen <a href="https://playcanvas.com/">https://playcanvas.com/</a> which could basically be generously called Unity Editor online.
