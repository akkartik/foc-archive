Jumperless V5 is designed to be infinitely open source and hackable. And that goes beyond the documentation and design files linked above. It also includes my support, advice, and assistance. Want to manufacture a dozen DIY Jumperless V5s for you and eleven of your friends? Want to improve my design by _upgrading_ that USB Type-C connector to Mini USB? I’m all about it. In fact, feel free to run your design by me so I can double-check everything before you send it off to your CM! I’ll even mail you the custom spring clips.\n",
