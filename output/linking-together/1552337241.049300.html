It isn't easy to draw a line, but I think having both "general" and "random" does make sense. I post stuff to "general" when I think it's interesting for most people and also worth their time. For things that aren't as relevant / practical / ... I post to "random". In other words, I'd say that "general" is for stuff that other's shouldn't miss and "random" is for the rest. I wouldn't mind if "random" was high traffic because I just skim over it most of the time. I follow "general" more closely.
