Hello everyone! My name is Joel and I was directed here by an acquaintance who felt I’d fit in with this crowd. :slightly_smiling_face: I would consider myself as someone who’s relatively young in the PL space but have just as much love and respect for the field as any veteran out there. I’m primarily interested in Term Rewriting, Pattern Matching/Substitution, and Symbolic programming. For the past few years I’ve been developing a library in Clojure to do “real programming” heavily based on those interests. I believe there’s tremendous benefit in bringing TR concepts into mainstream software engineering, technical and social.
