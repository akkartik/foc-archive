For anyone who was just in the symposium, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Garth Goldwater</span> asked for a beta invite to Dark. If you're interested in a beta invite, right now we're focused on onboarding slackbot projects.<br/><br/>If you have a Slackbot - please just fill out: <a href="https://darklang.com/beta">https://darklang.com/beta</a> and leave a note that you came from FoC (this is just to make my life easier - they go to me + Victoria + Jessica to organize and schedule). If you do that, I'll commit that you'll get an onboarding next Tues, Wed, or Fri :)<br/><br/>We've also just released a new version of the editor that feels more fluid vs. structural, so you'll get to give feedback on that. :star2:
