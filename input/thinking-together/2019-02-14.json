It's the potential, but also that the current state is far below what it already could be. I mean, software is the tool we use to make software; so we should be able to extrapolate the most amazing tools to do things better; and the best tools for making the best tools; etc. Something is missing",

Alan Kay says about this that \"perspective is worth 80 IQ points\", and to \"stand on the shoulders of giants\" (e.g. by sharing in this kind of environment and building on each other's ideas).\n\nOn the other hand, changing things is a serious matter to me (and I've heard the same from others). It's the potential, but also that the current state is far below what it already could be. I mean, software is the tool we use to make software; so we should be able to extrapolate the most amazing tools to do things better; and the best tools for making the best tools; etc. Something is missing"
