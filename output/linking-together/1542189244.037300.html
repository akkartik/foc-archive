It seems obvious that the person who knows most about the system needs to document it. However, it turns out <em>good</em> documentation often comes from other people, who had to understand the system from scratch long after it has been designed.<br/><br/>It’s hard to look at our own creations with a Beginner’s Mind again, but that’s really helpful, if not essential, to write good documentation.<br/><br/>And I’m not sure if writing documentation itself can be more fun — I’d like to think so. For sure though, there are people who like writing documentation. So it’s great if you have a chance to collaborate with those.
