Hi :wave:<br/><br/>My name is Marek and I’m a CTO and co-founder of a software house BAM.tech.<br/><br/>I have been a web developer for few years and been a CTO for almost 10 years now. As my company sells mostly “developer time”, I have the feeling that my business model is reaching it’s end and I try to prepare my company for the transition.<br/><br/>Last year I created a “Feature of Software” team at our company that I manage directly and we work on creating tools and processes that leverage AI in all steps of software creation: product management, project management, design, coding. We are working mainly on:<br/>• training people on existing tools (GPTs, Copilot and such)<br/>• creating our own tools: custom GPTs to remplace / improve on different steps in the process, code generation tools<br/>• spreading the word about AI and it’s impact<br/>I live in Paris, happy to connect on line or in the physical world.
