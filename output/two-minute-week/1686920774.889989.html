Generating initial content for an any workspace.<br/><br/><b>We are, by design, about non-linear explorations, in that setting it’s not always easy to start.</b><br/>A bit like sitting in front of a blank page. This feature is like priming / toning the canvas :wink:<br/><br/>I personally think visually a lot of the time (spatially / moving pictures), but <b>the</b> *trigger for starting a thread of thought is quite often a word, term, phrase or a sentence*.<br/>This feature is about that kind of exploration, you drop a word and it ripples out into all kinds of useful directions.<br/>(of course, being useful is the trick here, this is very minimal atm)<br/><br/>The way the app is set-up it’s not difficult for us to generate those workspaces (the blocks are Clojure maps in a re-frame db), so if it turns out that it’s useful we’ll probably generate more content.<br/><br/><a href="https://youtu.be/uycD_QoffDc">https://youtu.be/uycD_QoffDc</a>
