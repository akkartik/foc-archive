:satellite_antenna: I have a new project to share with you: <b><a href="https://ivanish.ca/hest-podcast/">Hest — The Podcast</a></b><br/><br/>What's Hest? It's my own personal FoC project, and I'll be using this new podcast to explore the design of it in great depth. The podcast is inspired by early episodes of the Future of Coding podcast, in which Steve recapped his research with a style that felt to me a little like <em>daydreaming</em>. I enjoyed those episodes very much, and have wanted to do something similar ever since I took over Steve's show. I've come up with my own twist on the format that should make it even more enjoyable and useful. Episodes will be brief, frequent, and light. There are already 6 episodes in the feed, so that you can try it out for a bit to see if you enjoy it before deciding to subscribe on an ongoing basis. The primary audience is... myself — this is an audio sketchbook. But I think some of you will find it interesting too.<br/><br/>For a slightly longer writeup about the podcast: <a href="https://ivanish.ca/hest-podcast/">https://ivanish.ca/hest-podcast/</a><br/><br/>To subscribe,<br/>• use this hand-crafted RSS feed: <a href="https://ivanish.ca/hest.rss">https://ivanish.ca/hest.rss</a><br/>• search for <b>Hest</b> or <b>Ivan Reese</b> in your podcast player of choice,<br/>• or click one of the buttons here: <a href="https://pod.link/1559446316">https://pod.link/1559446316</a><br/>This might not appeal to many people, but for those to whom it does, I sincerely hope you enjoy it.

Just finished the backlog. Really enjoying this and definitely hope you continue to make episodes. I have gotten rather tired of interview style podcasts and happy to see someone doing something else in the programming space. <br/><br/>I particularly liked your contrast with visual and graphical programming and your explicit notions of time. I find the latter really interesting. This is something that things like factorio have that I do think helps people understand their systems much better. <br/><br/>I also, like this idea of participatory execution, it puts words to an idea I have had for a while as well. The opaque nature of execution is most often at the root of why I have a hard time debugging software. Being able to participate, definitely seems to go a long way towards tackling that.<br/><br/>Finally, my suggestion might be a little bit weird, but I couldn’t help but think about the philosophical concept of hyper-time as you were talking about the various levels of time you have to think about. The typical metaphor for hyper time is actually, exactly the laying down rail road tracks you gave in the podcast. Imagine you are laying down tracks, tracks already laid are the past, the leading edge of the track is the present. The future doesn’t exist yet but are the tracks you will lay down.<br/><br/>Now imagine that all the tracks are red except there is 1 blue track 3 segments away from the leading edge. Suppose we decide to remove the latest three tracks (rewinding time) and replace the blue track with a red track. Now how do we talk about that? If we say something like “in the past there was a blue track”, we are speaking incorrectly in some sense. The “past” refers to the tracks that are not at the leading edge, and if we search those tracks there are no blue ones.<br/><br/>Instead we can say that in the “hyper-past” there was a blue track. Basically, hyper time is the time of the observer of the system.<br/><br/>Not sure if that was a good explanation, but I’ve found this paper on time travel without paradox to be a pretty good explanation. <a href="https://andrewmbailey.com/pvi/Changing_the_Past">https://andrewmbailey.com/pvi/Changing_the_Past</a>.<br/><br/>Not suggesting you need to use this in your programming system directly. But figured it might be a fun new angle to consider things from :)<br/><br/>Anyways, keep up the great work, really excited about this podcast.

That's wonderful! Thank you for the feedback. This idea of hyper-time sounds super relevant. As you noted, I do like having names for concepts, and I don't have good naming or framing for the different levels of time. That link seems to be a 404 — is this the link you meant? <a href="https://andrewmbailey.com/pvi/Changing_the_Past.pdf">https://andrewmbailey.com/pvi/Changing_the_Past.pdf</a>

I've been belatedly catching up. At episode 3 the metaphor of kids going down water slides is surprisingly powerful.<br/><br/>Are points in Hest like cells in a spreadsheet?<br/>But cells don't update instantaneously. Edges (confusing to wrap my head around) aren't the same as lines made of points. They're instead <em>shadows</em>, representations of the evolution of a point once it enters one end. Am I understanding right?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kartik Agaram</span> Your confusion about what edges <em>are</em> makes sense. I haven't done much to explain the technical relationship between graphical objects in Hest. So in entirely too much detail for a Slack message, here is the context needed to talk about what edges are (in the current prototypes), from the top, with a little bit of "designer commentary" along the way. This is long, so feel free to "nope" hard, haha!<br/><br/><em>Objects</em> are collections of <em>properties</em> with a unique identity. Bog standard.<br/>• Some say that the object "is" its properties, or "has" its properties — I go both ways.<br/>• This association of objects and properties in Hest isn't <em>graphical</em> yet. There's just a little property editor in the sidebar, like you'd see in Unity (say). Inelegant, but pragmatic.<br/>An object with a <em>position</em> property (eg: x, y, z) is by convention called a <em>point</em>.<br/>• Nothing more to it than that.<br/>• <em>Any</em> object with a position is a point.<br/>Objects can have other properties too, like information for the renderer / art tools.<br/>• An imported JPG that you place on the canvas is a point (has a position), and can be rendered as an image at that position.<br/>• Points will, by default, be rendered as little circles.<br/>• The Move tool reads/writes the position property.<br/>• This is all pluggable, and there will be a few episodes about how this works. It's an interesting comparison with the Glamorous Toolkit.<br/>Another property that an object can possess is <em>data.</em> When a point object has some data, I call it a <em>data point.</em><br/>• Data points are like spreadsheet cells, yes, in that they are containers for arbitrary data.<br/>• But there's nothing reactive going on here.<br/>• The data property is just an inert bucket for state.<br/>• Any object can have data — subject of an upcoming episode.<br/>• This part of the design has lots of weaknesses — like what to do about complex data structures. Again, pragmatic for now, elegant can come later.<br/>Another property that an object can possess is <em>behaviour</em>.<br/>• What a behaviour <em>is,</em> and how you'd make one, is out of scope. Just think of it as some function reference.<br/>Another property that an object can possess is an ordered list of references to points.<br/>• I call these objects <em>edges,</em> by convention.<br/>• Why "edge" and not "wire" or "path" or "curve" or something else? <b> shrug </b><br/>• The first point in the list is referred to as the <em>start point</em>, and the last is the <em>end point</em>.<br/>Edges will probably also have some special instructions for the renderer / tools.<br/>• The geometry of the edge will be created by interpolating the points, so the edge needs to specify the interpolation strategy to use (bezier? linear? spline?)<br/>Now, execution!<br/><br/>Points can have a property specifying which edge they're being <em>conveyed</em> by.<br/><br/>When a point is being conveyed by an edge:<br/>• The point's position will automatically be set by the execution engine.<br/>• As execution time advances, the point will be gradually moved along the edge from the start point to the end point.<br/>When the conveyed point reaches the end:<br/>• The end point's behaviour (function) will be invoked, if any.<br/>• The conveyed point will be provided as an argument to that function.<br/>• The function will do <em>whatever it does</em> with that point (probably something with the <em>data</em> inside that point, if any).<br/>• The result of the function will be a new point (probably with some new data).<br/>• The <em>end point</em> of the conveyor edge will probably be the <em>start point</em> of one or more other edges.<br/>• A copy of the new point will then be conveyed by each of those outbound edges.<br/>So in this situation, I say that the edge is a "conveyor", the point is "conveyed", and the action is "conveyance". It's like a train on a track, or a ball in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_ball_sculpture">rolling ball sculpture</a>. The conveyor is a concrete thing unto itself, with its own life and purpose. It's not just, like, a shadow or trail left behind by a point.<br/><br/>I hope that helps you make more sense of what I mean by "edge".<br/><br/>And as is common, a lot of this stuff is still changing in considerable ways. But the bones are all here, I think :)

Why does an edge need to have a list of points rather than just a list of raw positions? Is there any scenario you've come up with that needs the additional complexity?

does execution only occur at end points or can it occur along any point in an edge (for example stepwise or continuous transformations)? if not, are the in-between points in the edge meant purely as a ux affordance or do they do something else?

I imagine its just more regular to use points everywhere.  I guess you could get into lifecycle issues.  What happens to a point along an edge whose endpoints are moving?

Really enjoying this discussion — thanks, gang!<br/><br/>&gt; Why does an edge need to have a list of points rather than just a list of raw positions? Is there any scenario you've come up with that needs the additional complexity?<br/>There's surely a way to do Hest where the edges just have lists of coords, rather than lists of points. In many ways, there's hardly a difference. For instance: when you select and move an edge, the move tool would need to know how to update lists of coords, rather than how to update lists of points. (Whether this "knowledge" belongs within the move tool, or within the concept of an edge, is yet another thing I haven't yet settled on, but I digress.)<br/><br/>But other things would be quite different. Execution depends entirely on the existence of an end point (which contains the behaviour that will be invoked). Multiple edges can terminate at the same end point, so it would be quite different to (for instance) have the behaviour be a property of the edge rather than its end point.<br/><br/>Zooming out a bit — a list of coords is a more <em>closed</em>-feeling design, whereas a list of points is a more <em>open</em>-feeling design. There are lots of things you can do with coords, sure, but there are even more things you can do with points. Points, which always must contain some coords, are operationally a strict superset of coords.<br/><br/>Edges can share endpoints, but they can also share midpoints. That opens up some nice possibilities like <a href="https://twitter.com/spiralganglion/status/1390464018276438020">braiding</a> several edges together in the middle to cut down on visual noise. Sure you could do that with coords, but think about what it'd be like to write the tools for editing braided edges. If you define edges in terms of points, these extra features sort of just naturally fall out of the design.<br/><br/>William (as usual, haha) brought up a great thought-provoking question about this: What happens to a point along an edge whose endpoints are moving?<br/><br/>Here are some tweets showing what that <em>looks</em> like:<br/><br/>(A) <a href="https://twitter.com/spiralganglion/status/1145188460203872256">https://twitter.com/spiralganglion/status/1145188460203872256</a><br/>(B) <a href="https://twitter.com/spiralganglion/status/1153777314443849728">https://twitter.com/spiralganglion/status/1153777314443849728</a><br/><br/>Both of these are sort of.. joke tweets, in that they don't mean anything <em>computationally</em>. (And B is a flat out troll!) They're just experiments with what it looks / feels like to attach the points in an edge to another edge. In (A), the points are being conveyed. In (B), the points are attached at fixed positions.<br/><br/>Edge points attached to other edges at fixed positions — this is useful for making art (which is a big part of what Hest is for — it's a drawing program with programming features).<br/><br/>Edge points conveyed along other edges — this is a huge fucking can of worms. I'm pretty sure it opens the door to graphical metaprogramming / reflection. But it also makes the evaluation <em>fiendishly</em> complex. For instance: answering the question "how long until this conveyed data point reaches the conveyor's end point?" is no longer something I can do with closed-form math, if the conveyor is itself comprised of edges that are moving. So I need to tweak the execution semantics to pull it all back down to closed-form (haven't found a good way to do that yet). Or I need to accept the gross nondeterminism and potentially skyrocketing performance cost of doing arbitrarily complex collision detection (which is what I've been doing so far, naively).<br/><br/>Truth be told, I really love this part of the Hest project — there's a big hairy gross emergent-complexity consequence of the combination of otherwise fairly pure &amp; simple conceptual pieces. Many folks retch at this sort of complexity, and will kill themselves trying to find both perfectly pure atomic concepts and perfectly pure combinations thereof. Ask Whitehead and Russell how that went! Me, I'd rather embrace the inherent lumpiness of my conceptual dust particle, and grow a nice crystal around it.<br/><br/>Back to your original question, Kartik — why did I choose to do a list of points, not a list of coords? The real reason is quite boring: in 3D graphics, the vertex is the most foundational primitive, and edges are expressed in terms of vertices. So when doing the initial design, I just lifted that conceptual framework wholesale.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Garth Goldwater</span><br/>&gt; does execution only occur at end points or can it occur along any point in an edge (for example stepwise or continuous transformations)? if not, are the in-between points in the edge meant purely as a ux affordance or do they do something else?<br/>Only at end points. Purely as a UX affordance — edges are just connective tissue meant to space functions out. I'm not thinking at all about what functions are or how they work, or what it means to make a function act continuously rather than discretely.<br/><br/>That said: I'm already toying with "What if there were other execution strategies? What if you could choose which strategy applied? What if each layer / unit / instance of abstraction could individually choose which strategy applied?"<br/><br/>So it's possible that one of the strategies could do continuous transformation to a point being conveyed along an edge. Nothing precluding that. I just haven't designed that strategy.<br/><br/>In addition to the main strategy I'm focussed on — end points contain behaviour to apply to incoming data points — the second strategy I've thought the most about involves completely doing away with data points, and having the edges contain values.(Throwback to up above where I said "Any object can have data — subject of an upcoming episode.")

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Niko Autio</span> Thanks for the ideas!<br/><br/>&gt; First I think you don't have to worry about message streaming from outside world queue problem while using slow motion. When you are at slow motion you can think it as real slow motion observation. So real world data can be queueing somewhere but <em>from observation point of view</em> it's not existing yet (aka runtime implementation detail).<br/>It's likely you could spend <em>hours</em> continuously working in slow motion / reverse, so you wouldn't want something constantly trying to push data to Hest filling a queue that whole time. You're gonna have to throw some data away eventually (or, alternatively, just treat data coming into Hest as a pull rather than a push). All of that is fine... so long as you don't care about the resulting discontinuities. I worry about these discontinuities, because it introduces a bit of artificiality into the slow-mo debugging experience that doesn't match what you'd get out of the eventual full-speed execution. For example, if you're writing a system that conditions / smooths an input signal from a sensor, knowing that there's a limit to how much the value will change from one sample to the next is really useful.<br/><br/>Another option would be to keep a (large) queue, like you suggest, but rather than silently throwing away data when the queue gets too full, tell the programmer that they've spent too long in slow-motion so the data coming in is no longer going to be realistic.<br/><br/>&gt; Is it allowed to at any circumistances that value from x2 overtake value from x1?<br/>Yes, absolutely, that's something that is currently possible. I'd love to hear whether you think it'd be a good idea to restrict this.<br/><br/>&gt; One option could be normalize speed so that whenever signal splits every branch run exact speed that merging happens always simultaneously.<br/>Yeah, that's an interesting line of thinking. Even if it's good to (eg) allow x2 to overtake x1, there's still possibly a lot of expressive power that would come from saying "Hey Hest, take these two paths and adjust their conveyance rate so that points arrive at the end in sync".<br/><br/>I'm also really warming up to the idea that all paths should take a unit amount of time to convey along. So it doesn't matter how visually long a path is drawn, a point will (by default) go from one end to the other in 1 unit of time. That makes things <em>so much simpler</em> to reason about. The reason I've been reluctant to go this route is that I think the strong <em>pulse</em> of all these points moving all with the same cadence would potentially be nauseating to look at, <em>especially</em> in "focus mode" (where the camera is pinned to follow a single point).

I think this is "wrong problem to solve". If there is realtime source of data and which should be observable throught time, data must be saved or sacrify ability to observe everything by dropping data no matter what(?). :thinking_face:<br/><br/>&gt; Yes, absolutely, that's something that is currently possible. I'd love to hear whether you think it'd be a good idea to restrict this.<br/>It's quite distinctive feature from classic programming and it's quite easy to come up with scary scenarios.<br/>Example two sequential web requests take rare paths, one exceptionally short and one exceptionally long resulting users data being mixed in responses.<br/>Still this is new paradigm and therefore I don't have final answer to you right now :grin:<br/>Question is what are practical benefits of that behaviour and do they outweight disadvantages.<br/><br/>&gt; So it doesn't matter how visually long a path is drawn, a point will (by default) go from one end to the other in 1 unit of time.<br/>To be clear merging in sync require that paths will take uniform time independently how many edges and operations there is. In another words distinction between uniform time per edges VS uniform time per paths.

Just wanted to put out there that I was actually super excited about queuing when I first heard about hest and was a bit sad to see it considered a problem. Having bits of data wait for other bits to arrive and often be super useful and hard to express in normal languages, so I thought it would be a really nice abstraction to have by default.<br/><br/>I do get that having to try to time everything could be problematic. And I get not wanting to have action at a distance. So I wanted to just offer a perhaps silly not thought through suggestion. If things did queue by default, you could have it so that a point arriving at a destination can have an effect. So maybe we have two edges converging and a point arriving along edge A turns edge B into a Hyper Faster edge. Basically, like it is sitting on some pressure plate that activates it. Or maybe it could instead start a timer that if not interrupted will send that point off to be destroyed. <br/><br/>These sorts of mechanisms are similar to techniques in more advanced red stone contraptions so, they are pretty grounded in physical reality which I take it is one thing you kind of want to keep. <br/><br/>Just wanted to throw some ideas out there because I think that queuing can be super powerful and opens up so many different programming abilities.

Keep a queue, but expire things in the queue based on how long they've been waiting, rather than how large the queue is. Reminds me a bit of Mini Metro — when too many people are waiting at a station, a little countdown circle-wedge starts running and when it runs out you lose.
