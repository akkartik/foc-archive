        "text": "<@UJFN50C00> you’re covering a lot of ground.  Maybe we can sum part of it up with the image of a person pointing to the moon.  The gesture is simultaneously helpful for guiding the viewer’s gaze toward the moon yet inadequate in itself and certainly distinct from the moon.  A viewer could imitate the gesture without knowing what they’re pointing at.  But between pointing from multiple locations (triangulating) and some “find the moon” exercises, the viewer can get good at finding the moon even when the connection is obscured in some way.\n\nI’m reminded of one specific area of the Witness that explores this idea.  (Many areas do and in many different ways.)  In this particular area, you start with a direct connection between a shadow cast on a puzzle panel and the correct path you should trace on the panel.  As the series of puzzle panels progresses, intervening objects obscure the connection in a bunch of different and gradually more significant ways until, near the end, you see a panel in full sunlight.  The connection is now nowhere immediately obvious.",

There's a bit in the podcast about _Finnegan's Wake_ and whether novels really are a static medium compared to Smalltalk. I wonder if that discussion and this thread has been conflating 2 dimensions:\n• How large the universe of a medium is. For example, a drawing program with 4 colors has a smaller universe than one with 24-bit color.\n• The space of operations within easy reach. A codebase makes certain operations easy. Some of them are obvious to a new reader, others may require understanding some theory in the author's head. Yet others may be far away regardless. The codebase doesn't really help with those; you might be better off starting from scratch (though it may require a lot of knowledge to even assess that correctly) The relative fractions of these categories will vary from codebase to codebase. A school project likely enables less than the early implementation of awk or vi even if the LoC are comparable.\nIn these terms, perhaps we can agree that even if novels have as large a universe as dynamic media (or at least both are infinite in size), computers make more of it easily accessible to someone who is not James Joyce.",
