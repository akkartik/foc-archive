Do I have anything left to add to the conversation? Maybe! At my day job, I work on codebases of up to 100k lines of code, written by small teams, in mainstream languages. Barring a complete revolution, what incremental improvements can I imagine in my daily workflows? I've started sharing these ideas in a series of video talks, and in some cases also with clickable prototypes.\n\nThe first video <https:\/\/youtu.be\/8hVuOmgcd04> is an introduction, but to you here in the Future of Coding community, it _might_ feel like I'm preaching to the choir, so feel free to skip ahead. Video 2, 3 and 4 each explain one standalone idea, like \"Stretchy code map\" or \"Call graph navigator\". I'm working on the 5th as we speak. If you prefer to read text over watching video, transcripts are available on my bare-bones website <https:\/\/emilprogviz.com\/>\n\nI've worked on this in isolation for years, so now I'd love to hear some encouragement, but even more I'd love to hear which particular ideas you like best, or how you would improve on them!",
