Hope this isn’t spammy, but we are running a study on *how experienced developers leverage AI agents directly in their coding environments* and we are looking for developers that use AI agents so we can sort out what’s hype and what’s actually working and then publish that publicly for all to know. It’s a paid study ($100 Amazon gift card) through UC San Diego’s Foundation Interface Lab.\n\nIn particular, we’re looking for people using *terminal-based agents like* *Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, or Codex CLI*. We’ve already interviewed many Cursor and Copilot users.\n\n*What’s involved?*\n• 90-minute remote user study (via Zoom)\n• Working through a programming task of your choosing that involves agents while you code\n\n*Who can join?*\n• You must be located in the U.S and 18 years of age or older\n• You are a professional software engineer or developer with 3 or more years of experience\n• You are a professional software engineer or developer who uses agentic programming workflows (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, etc.).\n\nIf you are interested in participating, *please fill out this short <https:\/\/forms.gle\/keMeRNSvdicARJoXA|Google Form>*. We will be in touch with you ASAP to schedule a meeting.\n\nBy participating, you will help advance the state of human knowledge about the fast-evolving roles and practices of coding agents, potentially leading to more intelligent, efficient, and accessible software development. Thanks for considering!",
