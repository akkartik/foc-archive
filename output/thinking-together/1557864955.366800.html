Does anyone have any thoughts on reactive datalog (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgqFlowyfTA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgqFlowyfTA</a>)? To me, it would seem, with reactive datalog, a lot of translation code between nodes that are separate in size and distance (db, server, browser) become un-necessary. This would imply a multiplicative reduction in codebase size and proportionately reduced complexity.<br/><br/>I would across the software community were seeing an effort to push reactiveness into a component of the database, which of course, just shifts the effort, but does so in a manor that makes the tools (databases) easier to understand, rather then trying to bootsrape the functionality into your system later. Examples such as rethinkdb (rip), kafka streaming, spark, flink all do this at scale, but are unwiedly for small teams. More accessible reactive databases like firebase have a limited query  language and no universal way to update your client (browser) db.<br/><br/>So with that in mind, im very interested in:<br/><br/>• thoughts on reactive databases in general<br/>• thoughts on how to sync browser state with the database<br/>• examples of existing works and papers<br/>• mathematical models surrounding these concepts (algorithms, proofs etc...)<br/>• tradeoffs, maybe a reactive database requires vastly more memory and space?
