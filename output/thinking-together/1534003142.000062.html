<b>How does research work?</b><br/>My academic career was very short, I ended up working very early.<br/>Most of us here do research in one way or another, and I sometimes ask myself: "How does it work, really?"<br/>I'm less talking about how to write papers or do stuff that's required mostly for the bureaucracy and process overhead in academia and I'm more interested in what's considered good practice to formulate good research questions, tackle them, and keep making progress towards finding answers.<br/>Do you have any tips to share or resources to point to?<br/>How do you keep feeling productive and not just reading too much or wondering what to experiment with?<br/>Or simply put, what does your day look like, when you're "doing research"?<br/>(This is partly inspired by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span>'s log, which gives a good perspective into how he does it. Thanks for sharing your process, Steve!)
