<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> I want to weakly push back against that. Much of the hot water programming finds itself in is due to premature socialization.<br/><br/>People programming for themselves doesn't preclude distributing the fruits of their work. But programming for oneself is the purest sort of motivation, and we've forgotten that as computing has outgrown its hobbyist roots. It's worth preserving a reminder of the ultimate goal of all this: the empowered individual.
