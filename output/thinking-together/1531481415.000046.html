One thing I noticed during my research and also by reading through all the different link lists and individual links posted here is that it's really hard to get an overview of what's been done by other people. I'm wondering if there's a better way to collaboratively share knowledge and build upon what others have done. The first thing that comes to mind would be a wiki-like system. This could be used to organize different sources, probably by colaboratively writing summaries for these and linking to related stuff. On a higher level, this wiki could contain articles about "principles", "values" or simply knowledge derived from multiple sources. I think this would allow evolutionary process instead of the "reinventing the wheel" problem our industry is facing so often. What do you think?
