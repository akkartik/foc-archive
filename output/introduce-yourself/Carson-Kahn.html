Hey gang! :wave: I’m an insatiable learner, ML wonk, and product guy working on a low-code declarative framework for prescriptive analytics with my longtime friend and role model <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ryan Atallah</span>.<br/><br/>Having each founded/sold companies in this space previously, we’ve both been passionate about goals like <em>“offloading cognition to perception”</em> (Hullman &amp; Kayongo) and <em>“data applications that enhance human cognition”</em> (nos) for literally as long as we can remember… :nerd_face: Both being engineers who started out as designers, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> told us this was the perfect place to find likeminded folks! :spock-hand:<br/><br/>We’re interested in highly-abstracted or novel approaches to constrained optimization (MIP, MINLP, statistical) and related operations research problems; visual analytics/IVA with direct manipulation &amp; linked brushing; and techniques for modeling “<em>assumptions</em> as first-class citizens” in analytics &amp; simulation settings. :abacus: Outside of our current work, we’re hobbyhorsically fascinated by explorable explanations, machine-assisted creativity, etc etc. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>Looking forward to meeting more of you, and to learning from all of you! :pray:<br/><br/><em>P.S.</em> Although it’s not relevant to my Ryan/my work on Spindle, here’s an HC simulator in the browser I’ve been enjoying lately, for all of us HyperCard :hypercard: nostalgiacs: <a href="http://hypercardsimulator.com">hypercardsimulator.com</a> (you can also convert old HyperCard stacks into JS/JSON with Dan’s <a href="https://hypervariety.com/ConvertHCStack/">ConvertHCStack</a>)
