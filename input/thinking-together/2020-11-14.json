Nim has lisp style macros, and liberally uses high level rewrite passes to generate optimized code. For example, Nim has the concept of an <https:\/\/nim-lang.org\/docs\/manual.html#iterators-and-the-for-statement-first-class-iterators|inline iterator>, which gives you convenient python style iterator syntax, but rewrites the code into a more optimal for loop. <https:\/\/nim-lang.org\/docs\/asyncdispatch.html|Async \/ Await> in Nim is entirely built as a macro library. But, as interesting as those examples are, any language with a macro system can accomplish something similar in theory.\n\nWhat is interesting about Nim is that it is purely a \"compiler front end\" to use compiler terminology. Nim does not produce assembly language. It produces C code that can then be fed into any C compiler. This means the output is fairly high level, and while it's not \"pretty\" or  \"elegant\", it's inspectable! You can read it and understand what is going on.",

This means the output is fairly high level, and while it's not \"pretty\" or  \"elegant\", it's inspectable! You can read it and understand what is going on."
