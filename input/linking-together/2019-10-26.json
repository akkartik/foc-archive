If you remove free software from the conversation, than the apps you listed are actually priced dirt cheap. For example, Ulysses is $40 a year, compared to Superhuman's $360. Ulysses\/Things\/Omnifocus for the most part are priced the same as most mass-market, unspecialized, paid software, e.g., similar to MS Office ($70\/year). Superhuman is priced closer to the first tier of more specialized expensive software, e.g., something like the Adobe Suite ($600\/year), or Ableton Live ($1000+\/one time fee plus upgrades $500 upgrades every three years or so).",

If you remove free software from the conversation, than the apps you listed are actually priced dirt cheap. For example, Ulysses is $40 a year, compared to Superhuman's $360. Ulysses\/Things\/Omnifocus for the most part are priced the same as most mass-market, unspecialized, paid software, e.g., similar to MS Office ($70\/year). Superhuman is priced closer to the first tier of more specialized expensive software, e.g., something like the Adobe Suite ($600\/year), or Ableton Live ($1000+\/one time fee plus upgrades $500 upgrades every three years or so)."
