Wonder whether the call of universal AST comes from the human ability ignore details.  Let's say every structured imperative language feels the same after you've been at this for a while.  It feels – as a person – that you're operating on the same step-by-step statement built of expression substrate with loops and branching, but this is an illusion.  In the details, every language has it's own finicky bits* (scope, precedence, where what kinds of declarations are allowed) that make any tool 20% common core and 80% exceptions.  (I suppose that where the <span style="background-color:#ccf">@James Koppel</span>'s work comes in — promise to read.)  (* Lua has the fewest by the way.  :wink:)

Agree - there is a tendency to ignore detail and find the common patterns. This is powerful though - and behind the general idea of 'finding abstractions' as well?<br/><br/>My feeling about universal AST is that it's a starting point but not a stopping point. What kinds of programs would be excluded by any chosen universal AST? Do we just end up with a 'general purpose graph/tree' structure (~infra) when we accommodate all the different styles? <br/><br/>How does this scale up to multiple trees? Do we still use disjoint AST/trees or do we allow system visible cross links?<br/><br/>Also, what kinds of paradigms are excluded by this notion of programming? This is the batch model - i.e. must write in full and then submit/install your program to the system for execution.
