Then the identity element is (0,0,1,1), multiplication is (x1,y1,w1,h1)(x2,y2,w2,h2) = (x1+w1*x2, y1+h1*y2, w1*w2, h1*h2), and inversion is (x,y,w,h)^{-1} = (-x\/w, -y\/h, 1\/w, 1\/h). Given two rectangles a and b there is a unique affine transform of the plane taking a to b,. If we apply that affine transform takes a third rectangle c, then the result can also be given by the formula b*a^{-1}*c.\n\nThe other neat thing about this is we don't have to implement rectangles and affine transformations as separate entities because rectangles also act as affine transformations.
