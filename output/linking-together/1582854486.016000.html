i had a brief acquaintance with Mr. Tesler; we had mutual friends. He was indeed around some of the major innovations; frankly almost all of our current technology comes directly from Xerox PARC which was staffed by Licklider who knew all the graduate students to hire. People don't often credit the casting director of a film or a company, but the person who selects a winning team is indeed one of the greatest brains behind a company.  Tesler once remarked to me that he intensely disliked Steve Jobs. Evidently Jobs was quite difficult to get along with.

Cross-link to a Ted Nelson rant from 2012: <a href="../thinking-together/1583565732.099000.html">../thinking-together/1583565732.099000.html</a>. Particularly for the following passage:<br/><br/>&gt; I learned in high school that the craft of writing consists mainly of rewriting, and that rewriting consists mainly of rearrangement. Once you’ve written something it’s in the wrong order. Then you cut it apart and arrange the pieces of paper in the right order. This can take some time and you may have pieces of paper lying around your desk or your bedroom floor. For hundreds of years, this process was called “cut and paste.”<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Did PARC give us a good way to cut and paste? NO! PARC gave us an abominable editing mechanism propagandistically hidden behind the former term. The abominable mechanism is a hidey hole you can put something into, and it’s called “the clipboard”. And hiding something in the clipboard has since 1984 been called “cut”. Then you choose where this one piece goes and blurp it out. And this blurp-out action has since 1984 been called “paste”.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Not only did PARC take away the fundamental method of reorganization, and give us a hidey hole instead, but they gave that hidey hole the name of the previous method. Which in true Orwellian style has made people forget. And the Macintosh laid it on us in 1984, the Orwellian year.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Now, this twisting of the previous terminology for an entirely different function was perpetrated by… Larry Tesler, who is one of the nicest guys I know. As the Christians say, hate the sin but love the sinner. I’ve been corresponding with Larry, no time to read his beautiful reply until now. He thinks, old fashioned cut and paste is a complex method for professionals and researchers. And ordinary people don’t need anything better. I’ll be putting his beautifully written reply in the next edition of <em>Geeks</em>.
