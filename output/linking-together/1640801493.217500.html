Before you go off inventing new programming languages, please ask yourself these questions:<br/>1. What problem does this language solve? How can I make it precise?<br/>2. How can I <em>show</em> it solves this problem? How can I make it precise?<br/>3. Is there another solution? Do other languages solve this problem? How? What are the advantages of my solution? of their solution? What are the disadvantages of my solution? of their solution?<br/>4. How can I <em>show</em> that my solution cannot be expressed in some other language? That is, what is the unique property of my language which is lacking in others which enables a solution?<br/>5. What parts of my language are <em>essential</em> to that unique property?Â <br/><a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/687#comment-18074">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/687#comment-18074</a>

Well, these are all excellent points, and that's an interesting post on LtU.<br/><br/>But I think that, since 99.9% of new languages won't succeed, you may as well just follow your heart anyway, and have fun doing what feels good to you.

Even better if you read it as "before you share the new programming language you've invented" because those are the questions that others will immediately ask.  Might as well be prepared.
