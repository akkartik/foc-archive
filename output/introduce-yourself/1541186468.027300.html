Hi everybody! I’m a programmer based in Dubai/Kashmir. I’m a Mechanical engineer by training, but have been programming since a very young age. I tried to build multiple edtech products before this, and all of them failed and taught me important lessons and I’m happy to be a better developer and even better person because of those experiences. I love reading the works of Vannevar Bush, Alan Kay and Bret Victor. I also like hiking and camping, and also Urdu/Persian/Kashmiri poetry.<br/><br/>I’m currently working on a project which doesn’t have a name yet. But I’m basically trying to build a new type of digital document which is intended to be non-linear, dynamic, and action-oriented.<br/><br/>The document can be made using an editor that I’m currently building which will resemble Google Docs in terms of UI, but the document itself will allow writers to write in a format that allows you to “dive deeper” into particular sections of text allowing readers to go down a “rabbit hole” or skim a document.<br/><br/>The document will also be connected to various webservices and will allow users to construct pipelines of actions/triggers which can modify it, for example — “When somebody mentions me on Twitter, add a row to this table on this document, send an SMS to my friend, and then set the value of the “mentions” column on this other table to +1 from what it is already” .<br/><br/>I don’t have a name for the project right now, but I’m close to launching a public version of it. I wish to speak with people who can critique the idea, offer some feedback, or even if it sounds useful/useless I am happy to hear more about why/why not.<br/><br/>I am also applying to business school these days and sorting out my GMAT, although if I could afford it, I would just focus on building this full time.

Good to see another mechanical engineer. Interesting project, reminds me a bit of a modern version of Xanadu.
