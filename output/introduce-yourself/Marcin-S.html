Hello, everybody. My name is Marcin and I am a hacker. I found this place after finding a HN thread about Bret Victor, made a bet it would be full of interesting people, and I have won that bet. <br/><br/>I've read some of the introductions here and I wonder where all these people were during my life at academia. I quit my degree - for good reasons - but I do miss having a network to jump into projects with. <br/><br/>I've worked on a lot of smaller projects in different environments- everything between application reverse engineering Android to assisting researchers with biological modelling. An early-learned habit of extreme privacy means I have little to share, unfortunately. <br/><br/>I've joined this place to see if I can learn how to think out of the box more often; what things combine together to make an effective engineer in unexpected ways. I also have a desire to do new things, and I can only hope this place has plenty of unlaid roads to fill.<br/><br/>Finally - if there's anybody within Morocco that wants to meet up, let me know. It just so happens to be where I'm living in the foreseeable future.
