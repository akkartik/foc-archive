I read a lot of the VPRI papers and even if they are more abstract and there’s little source code available, the concepts are pretty solid and there are enough clever people out there who could certainly “fill in the blanks”.\n\nWhat I would like to see even more is that thinking that motivated STEPS, the economy of creating something incredibly useful with orders of magnitude less complexity, and not being afraid to reinvent some of the foundations, spread to more projects. Instead of just taking what we are given, in the form of existing platforms, libraries and frameworks, and exclusively trying to innovate on top of them."
