They are hard, fraught with \"peril\" if you will, but can really shake things up. I agree with you on going back to the fundamentals. I have often found my most paradigm shifting moves have been when I start to feel stuck in the mire of all the complexity. Life is complex, but mostly we tend to tack on artificial complexity. If you can step back and look at the fundamentals there is often a new model that is begging to get out of the problems space, but we were just too far down the path we started down to notice.",

They are hard, fraught with \"peril\" if you will, but can really shake things up. I agree with you on going back to the fundamentals. I have often found my most paradigm shifting moves have been when I start to feel stuck in the mire of all the complexity. Life is complex, but mostly we tend to tack on artificial complexity. If you can step back and look at the fundamentals there is often a new model that is begging to get out of the problems space, but we were just too far down the path we started down to notice."
