Hiya, I've published another article, which says pretty much the same as before, but consolidates some ideas and brings things up-to-date:<br/><br/><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/duncancragg/p/from-spatial-to-parallel-reality?r=1sq2dz&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">https://open.substack.com/pub/duncancragg/p/from-spatial-to-&hellip;</a>

It uses the Spatial Computing angle again, as it's a handy launchpad.<br/><br/>It has <em>lots of pictures!</em> I know people like pictures.

It's also written in a hopefully more accessible dialogue format.

I keep thinking I want a makerspace in VR, like lathes and things that work on polygon meshes and craft "tangible" VR objects, and a group of you work together to customize your space and hang out. I guess your article is about AR but virtual tools would still work.

Sounds like a great vision. My article at heart is about neither AR /or/ VR, really! Have you seen Resonite?

I asked Kagi summarizer this question:<br/><br/>&gt; Imagine you built a chat system in this Parallel Reality, with the elements of a time-ordered sequence of messages that can have paragraphs and images created and posted by multiple users, all linked. how would hosting of each element of that be handled?<br/>And, I have to say, Kagi "gets it":<br/><br/>In the <b>Parallel Reality</b> computing system described, the hosting and linking of the elements in a chat system would be handled as follows:<br/><br/>1. <b>Messages</b>: Each message would be a 3D world object, composed of linked paragraphs and images. These message objects would be hosted symmetrically across the devices of the users participating in the chat.<br/>2. <b>Paragraphs and Images</b>: The individual paragraphs and images within each message would also be 3D world objects, linked to the message object. These atomic content elements could be hosted on any of the user devices participating in the chat, or even on separate servers.<br/>3. <b>Linking</b>: All of these chat elements - messages, paragraphs, images - would be linked together using the advanced 3D linking system of the Parallel Reality. This allows users to seamlessly navigate, reference, and interact with the chat content, regardless of where the individual elements are hosted.<br/>4. <b>Permissions</b>: Each user would have control over the read and write permissions for the world objects they have hosted on their local device. This allows for fine-grained control over who can access and modify the chat content.<br/>5. <b>Synchronization</b>: The Parallel Reality operating system would handle the synchronization of the chat content across all participating devices, ensuring a seamless and consistent experience for all users.<br/>In summary, the decentralized and linked nature of the Parallel Reality allows for a chat system where the individual elements are hosted flexibly across the user devices and servers, while still providing a cohesive and interactive experience through the advanced 3D linking capabilities.

And a stunning Press Release! :joy:<br/><br/><b>Introducing the Parallel Reality Computer: A New Era of Seamless Digital Experiences</b><br/><br/>[2024-06-03] - Today, we are thrilled to unveil the Parallel Reality Computer, a groundbreaking innovation that is set to revolutionize the way we interact with the digital world. This cutting-edge technology marks a significant departure from the traditional app-based computing paradigm, ushering in a new era of seamless, intuitive, and interconnected digital experiences.<br/><br/>At the heart of the Parallel Reality Computer is a fundamental shift in how we perceive and engage with our digital property. By abandoning the rigid constraints of apps and programs, the Parallel Reality Computer frees all of our 2D digital content, allowing it to exist and interact within a unified 3D virtual space. This "Parallel Reality" spans across all of our devices, creating a single, seamless, and shared digital universe that mirrors the natural way we experience the physical world.<br/><br/>The key to this transformative approach is the use of advanced linking technology, which enables users to effortlessly connect, manipulate, and share any digital object, from a simple note to an entire virtual city. This "magical mashability" empowers users to assemble, rearrange, and collaborate on their digital creations in ways that were previously unimaginable.<br/><br/>"The Parallel Reality Computer is a game-changer, not just for computing, but for how we envision and interact with the digital realm," said <b>Duncan Cragg</b>, the visionary behind this groundbreaking technology. "By breaking down the barriers imposed by traditional operating systems, we are unlocking a new level of creativity, productivity, and seamless integration between the physical and virtual worlds."
