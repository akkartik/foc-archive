Hi, I'm Jack Armitage. I am a PhD student in Media &amp; Arts Technologies in the Augmented Instruments Lab, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London.<br/><br/>I have been studying music technology and musical instrument design for around 10 years. My undergrad was BSc Music, Multimedia &amp; Electronics at the University of Leeds, and after that I was a research engineer at <a href="http://www.roli.com">www.roli.com</a> and later <a href="http://www.fxpansion.com">www.fxpansion.com</a> working on instrument quality and developing visuo-tactile materials and interfaces. My PhD focuses on craft in digital musical instrument design, and how one's "ability to craft" is impacted by the tools, methods and technologies used (<a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=APvoBhUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=APvoBhUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en</a>).<br/><br/>I was somehow exposed to Bret Victor's Inventing on Principle around 2012 at the end of my undergrad, and from there I became quite obsessed with the history of 'The New Medium'. While working in the music technology industry I was seeing everything through Bret Victor and Alan Kay's eyes; 10's of expert designers and engineers spending 10's of thousands of pounds and 6 months to explore singular, basic ideas, and as a result not having any time or money - or even awareness - of possible 'bigger ideas' that could be explored.<br/><br/>I started my PhD wanting to solve these problems by creating new tools and programming languages that treat instrument designers as artists (see 'Artists and the Art of the Luthier' by Bill Buxton). However I made the mistake of interviewing violin makers in my first study, which has taken me down the rabbit hole of embodied craft practice, which I am now trying to reconcile with digital technology :slightly_smiling_face:. In my spare time I compose and produce music, and 'live code' music onstage using Haskell (<a href="http://tidalcycles.org">http://tidalcycles.org</a>). My latest music project just launched on Tuesday: <a href="http://offer.band">http://offer.band</a><br/><br/>Based in London, always happy to talk over email or meet up for a coffee, and host visits to the Instruments Lab (<a href="http://instrumentslab.org">http://instrumentslab.org</a>). Thank you <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span> for inviting me to the recent London meetup and subsequently to this group. I am very intrigued to learn more about the people in this group!
