Some good points, although he glosses over Prof. Wirth's work. I was a disciple of Prof. Wirth and used his Modula-2 language, perhaps one of only 100 people in the USA making products with it against the C juggernaut. The problem with language selection is 1) inertia is the most powerful force in the universe, and 2) it is an intrinsically conservative part of the brain to acquire and repeat a language, we are not wired to learn new ones, but keep using the current one,  3) humans are a herd animal, and seek safety by copying the majority, with prevents change.
