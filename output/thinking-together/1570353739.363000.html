In fact, when I do some Scratch workshop to show what programming is to people who never do it, I show how simple it is to program a simple game with Scratch. I tell them that during the workshop they have used to chore concepts programmers use (data, loops, if/then/else...). But what make the difference with professionnal developpers is that the dev have to manage complexity, and they use those raw concepts for that.
