Hi, a couple months ago I've started a weekly online Zoom meetup centered around <b>visual programming</b>, <b>tech</b> and <b>installation art</b>, called <b>Midweek Patch Therapy</b>.<br/><br/>There's usually a few things worth sharing from each session - issue solutions, presentations of interesting projects and so on.<br/>I edit these down into short YouTube videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE5Vpk-8Y4F9qP2vEn32OPA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE5Vpk-8Y4F9qP2vEn32OPA</a><br/><br/>Right now it's mostly visited by people from the vvvv community.<br/><br/>However I would like to expand the reach and mix things up a little :cat2::poodle:.<br/><br/><b>So if you're interested in meeting new people, sharing and discussing ideas and projects or maybe just sitting back while learning something,</b><br/><b>please accept my warmest invitation to join us every Wednesday at 17:30 CET at <a href="https://therapy.domj.net/">https://therapy.domj.net/</a></b><br/><br/>Feedback on the format, topics, video quality, etc. is also very much welcome, just as any questions you might have!
