Hello everyone! PhD student in CS but have been coding for around 15 years. I've done hundreds of things as I was always "following the new trends" during all this time. As of today, I'm very into JIT compilers and WebAssembly, also my PhD is on Scientific Visualization with an application to Biology. These days I'm going through some kind of early-adult-life crisis, I had a daughter 3 years ago and that changed my perspective on life completely. I used to be a very chill person and didn't worry about "monetizing" my career. Now I have bills to pay and I want to find ways to turn my talent into profit. This has been very difficult as my network is mostly scientists and we are very disconnected from /the real world/. I've tried to join some university incubators but had no success (I could tell the story later). I'm mainly looking to network with people to either 1. get into a new venture/startup and help getting it off the ground or 2. find a nice job to go to after I finish my PhD. Don't hesitate to message me if you want to talk about pretty much anything (I read a lot about many things, not only science related). I've been reading HN (and other stuff) daily since 2009, so if you just want to talk industry gossip is cool for me. Also greetings everyone :smile:!
