If you have any Zoom/Google Meet calls today, here’s new something you can try: it’s a call bot prototype called Action Cat <a href="https://interconnected.org/more/2022/action-cat/">https://interconnected.org/more/2022/action-cat/</a><br/><br/>I’ve been writing recently about how apps could use spreadsheets to expose functionality, as a way to be useful but also open to end-user customisation. And I’m also super curious about how live feedback in a meeting can change the way that meeting works<br/><br/>So this is an experiment about that! I ran into the folks at Reduct.Video and they were up for working together. It shows a live transcript of your call, and the twist is that is drops it into Google Sheets which is pre-configured to track phrases like “remind me”… but you can then search for anything, or do calculations like “who has spoken most”<br/><br/>I’d love to hear about what it’s like to use, and whether this spreadsheet approach might be a more generalisable pattern
