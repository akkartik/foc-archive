Hi all! I found out about this Slack group from <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andrew Condon</span>, thanks for sharing it with me!<br/><br/>I’m Mike, and most of my work with coding these days involves creating interactive musical environments through code. I’ve spent many years programming in SuperCollider and CSound and have made work at places like the Grame in Lyon and IRCAM in Paris. The prevailing approach in most French music institutions was to make digital music creation low-code or no-code. Over time, I’ve developed a different opinion: code, like natural language, is a powerful way not only to express our ideas but also learn and develop new ideas. I think this is especially true with functional programming, where the process of constructing proofs in the type system leads to creative epiphanies that make their way into one’s art (in my case, into my music).<br/><br/>If you’re into functional programming and music, I’d encourage you to check out <a href="https://wags.fm">https://wags.fm</a> (gh repo <a href="https://github.com/mikesol/wags.fm">here</a>) and <a href="https://mikesol.github.io/sf">https://mikesol.github.io/sf</a> (gh repo <a href="https://github.com/mikesol/sf">here</a>). Contributions and new perspectives are always welcome! I’m very much looking forward to learning from all of you.

Wow thats cool. I love the writups its great for inspiration and understanding.  I made some music stuff on Observable. Its all reactive so you can fiddle with the sample speeds in realtime <a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/sequencer">https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/sequencer</a><br/><br/>I was looking to integrate a synth next, maybe piano roll or something.
