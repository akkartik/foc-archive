I am relatively new to programming world and I usually work with python, C++ although I have also learnt Rust, Solidity and other stuff. I am more inclined towards the emerging technologies and want to contribute to it. Apart from programming I like to read and write or participate in Kaggle competitions. I am currently working as a Software Developer intern at a startup and looking for new opportunities. I am very excited to get to know everyone and maybe huddle sometime.",
