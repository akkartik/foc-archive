I'm new here, I wrote an introduction at <a href="../introduce-yourself/1613857840.000600.html">../introduce-yourself/1613857840.000600.html</a><br/><br/>The more I learn about other people's future-of-coding experiments, the less original my own ideas seem, to the point where many of them don't seem worth sharing anymore. Do I have anything left to add to the conversation? Maybe! At my day job, I work on codebases of up to 100k lines of code, written by small teams, in mainstream languages. Barring a complete revolution, what incremental improvements can I imagine in my daily workflows? I've started sharing these ideas in a series of video talks, and in some cases also with clickable prototypes.<br/><br/>The first video <a href="https://youtu.be/8hVuOmgcd04">https://youtu.be/8hVuOmgcd04</a> is an introduction, but to you here in the Future of Coding community, it <em>might</em> feel like I'm preaching to the choir, so feel free to skip ahead. Video 2, 3 and 4 each explain one standalone idea, like "Stretchy code map" or "Call graph navigator". I'm working on the 5th as we speak. If you prefer to read text over watching video, transcripts are available on my bare-bones website <a href="https://emilprogviz.com/">https://emilprogviz.com/</a><br/><br/>I've worked on this in isolation for years, so now I'd love to hear some encouragement, but even more I'd love to hear which particular ideas you like best, or how you would improve on them!

It's rough, but I think it's worth pushing for a better status quo. Personally, the more overlap I see with others here, the more reassured and validated I am about my own intuition about what needs to change, how, and how important it is. Also, it speaks to an increased likelihood that such changes will come from somewhere. I'll take a look at your work, but regardless, keep up the good effort!

I've only watched the first video so far, but I'm going to share some feedback that totally diverges from your explicit area of interest:<br/><br/>Your production values are fantastic. I so appreciate your attention to framing, sound quality, preparation, editing, and other aspects of communication. Irrespective of the content itself (which is great, but you'll hear that from a ton of other members I'm sure), you need to know that the effort you've put into the quality and clarity of your expression is not lost on this audience, and is in fact exemplary.

Just to clarify: If my choice of words made it sound like overlap feels discouraging to me, I chose the wrong words. Overlap is super encouraging, I agree with Dan! I meant it as an explanation of why my initial videos show relatively minor ideas, compared to the more lofty goals this community is aiming towards. I share the lofty goals too, but I didn't prioritize them - we'll see if I can contribute anything more than "+1" there, later.<br/><br/>Ivan, thanks so much! This kind of feedback, while tangential, is lovely to hear. :blush::partying_face: It's true that I put in a lot of effort, and I'm glad that it seems to help the message get across. I guess I got somewhat burned when early attempts at sharing my ideas IRL, with improvised elevator pitches and sloppy sketches on napkins, mainly caused yawns, misunderstandings and shallow dismissals. These experiences made me realize that I needed to work on my delivery! Also, a former colleague was a successful Youtuber (FunFunFunction) and although I have zero desire to become a Youtuber, I guess I can't resist striving towards that quality bar in the videos.

I second Ivan on the video quality. As a non English native speaker, I often have understanding difficulties with video format. Not yours. Good audio quality, good choice of words, good illustrations, good rhythm, good length. Thanks for the effort!

Thanks for the feedback, I'm glad you liked it! :blush: As another non-native English speaker, I often have the same difficulty as you. I still need to work on my pronunciation - "function" tends to come out as "fanction", and I sometimes mix up "two" and "to" which might be confusing to viewers. To compensate, I provide proper subtitles instead of YouTube's auto-generated ones.<br/><br/>Does anyone have feedback on the ideas / prototypes in episode 2, 3 or 4? :pray:

I've only watched 1 &amp; 2 so far (yes, the videos are short, but this community drops a <em>lot</em> of reading on my plate, haha).<br/><br/>For #2, I found the scaling text to be... the sort of thing that is very hard to appreciate without actually working directly with. I recently went through a period where I used semantic highlighting (instead of syntax highlighting), since it was also the sort of thing that seems good in the abstract but is hard to understand without living with. It didn't stick — I'm back with syntax highlighting — because the plugin that I used didn't produce colors that were as visually pleasing as my syntax highlighting. If I'm going to be staring at something all day, I want it to be comfortable (for the same reason I don't want an uncomfortable chair, even if it might help me stay more alert, say). So if I were to actually try the scaling text, I might find that I like it. But it'd be very hard for me to evaluate it unless it were quite polished. That's a catch-22. The demo in the video did a good job presenting the thinking behind the idea, but the implementation (as captured by the video, at least) was too.. detached from my reality... for me to really develop a sense of it.<br/><br/>But then, I'm sort of a stick in the mud when it comes to text, hah. So I'm excited to watch some of your more visual prototype videos when I get the chance.

One thing to do with text is to keep it fixed-size while scaling other representations.  With some VR stuff we were doing, all the labels were composited separately from the scene so as to be as readable as possible.  Since you don't want the text too close, we ended up with the weird effect where an object could be in-front of its label, which would still be visible since it's rendered on top.  (I guess a similar thing happens with AR all the time, but that sort of glitch feels different since the goal is to have the AR model be embedded into the scene rather than ghost overlaid.)

I think a lot of his work shares some overlap. i love your style of visualization so far and am excited to dig in!

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Emil H</span> —just wanted to say I loved the stretchy code map video! I think altering sizes as in your demo is a compelling concept for more efficient code comprehension. <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Garth Goldwater</span> is correct that there is some overlap in my Tiled Text project, though I was trying to solve a different problem (efficiently navigating/manipulating structured text with low-precision/low unique-symbol-count input devices). The way my system was structured would make it easy to render text at varying sizes as a function of tree depth—but it leaves a number of questions open-ended about practically editing programs, and the code is a nightmare jumble of 10 year old java. Looking forward to seeing more of your videos!

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span>, yeah, I guess it's next to impossible to keep up with everyone's projects here, so thanks for engaging with mine, but no pressure :)<br/><br/>I hear you, I've also had the experience of being exited by new features in code editors, then trying them properly and getting somewhat disappointed. One relevant example is the minimap scrollbar which I believe was invented, or at least popularized, by Sublime Text. There's nothing <em>wrong</em> with the idea or implementation, a minimap is just not as game-changing to my workflow as I originally hoped, because the shape of my code is not <em>that</em> recognizable when zoomed out far. I was gonna talk about this in video #2 but cut it to keep the length down and the focus sharp.<br/><br/>Hmm, I wonder if some ideas are easier to evaluate at a glance, while others are harder and require an almost finished implementation. So choosing to develop one of the hard-to-evaluate ideas is a bigger gamble. One might spend years, only to discover that it was a bad idea. And I believe that the implementation of #2 would be particularly challenging. I'd probably need to consult with someone way better at math than me. In case anyone's curious, the challenge is to decide the font size for each row. Well, the initial "overview from outside in" view is trivial, the font size is simply a function of the tree depth, but the "context from inside out" views are much trickier. I came up with a system of constraints (font size of row A is &lt;= row B, when caret is at row C) but for <a href="https://emilprogviz.com/stretchy-code-map/toggle.html">the prototype</a> I precalculated a solution offline, and also tweaked sizes by hand, which obviously won't work in a real editor.

Garth, thanks for the warm words! And I agree about the similarities. Although I and westoncb tried to solve different problems, the resulting "look &amp; feel" is similar when our lines shift up and down with smooth animation. You <span style="background-color:#ccf">@westoncb</span> seem to value high framerates and distinct visual &amp; auditory feedback - did you also work on games, by any chance? I find that level of polish to be common in games but depressingly rare in most other software.<br/><br/>Dammit, now I can't help but fantasize about how to combine your TiledText editing with my varying font sizes... You're right that simply shrinking the font size as a function of tree depth wouldn't be good enough, because no one wants to select, cut&amp;paste text that's 3px high. That's why the active line in <a href="https://emilprogviz.com/stretchy-code-map/toggle.html">my prototype</a> is always at full size. In TiledText you probably want all lines that you're cycling through to be at full size? But other lines, that are not in the current cycle, could vary? So when functions are collapsed, for example like on the 1st frame of <a href="https://youtu.be/tztmgCcZaM4">your demo video</a>, maybe instead of being completely collapsed to 1 line, the function bodies could be displayed with the tree-depth-scaling method, quite small, as "thumbnails" or "previews" of what you'll see when you expand them. There's a part in the video where you say "let me go to a longer method real quick" and open the right one by memory, but with "thumbnails" you wouldn't need to remember. There's ofc a trade-off between making the cycle-list maximally compact, and making the "thumbnails" readable, but that's a knob one can turn to find a sweet spot.<br/><br/>Hmm, there's some more overlap coming in my next video, number #5. I wonder if there a term for when we're trying to solve different problems, and still end up with similar solutions. Not exactly "convergent evolution", but close.<br/><br/>Sidetrack: I've always wanted a good visualizer of data structures, and I had started to sketch out the basics when I saw westoncb's work <a href="http://symbolflux.com/projects/avd">Lucidity</a> a few years back, which made me promptly drop my own project because you seem to be already creating exactly the kind of visualization I wanted. Thanks for that overlap! Very impressive work, I hope you'll release it some day!

I see part of it coming from a higher ideal for what user learning/mastery can be like—especially that we see fluency as a realistic goal, allowing users to reach a point where control of the software becomes nearly an entirely subconscious process (maybe this forces a useful design constraint of non-complexity more strongly than elsewhere in software). There's also a kind of avoiding rough edges and having a base assumption that things will evolve without discontinuity that makes games more interesting / pleasant to interact with imo. It's hard to be enthralled by software which is, at least in appearance, largely static after working on games for a while...<br/><br/>&gt;  In TiledText you probably want all lines that you're cycling through to be at full size? But other lines, that are not in the current cycle, could vary?<br/>I did some experiments along these lines while developing Tiled Text and couldn't find a particular config that wasn't distracting/disconcerting. But the scales I was playing with were different from your experiment: I was only making relatively small modifications, so I didn't get the interesting "zoomed out map" kind of effect shown in your demo.<br/><br/>&gt;  ... but with "thumbnails" you wouldn't need to remember.<br/>Agreed. And the "thumbnail" concept is again a very natural fit since the contents of a "tile" in Tiled Text is already literally a raster image produced by walking a subtree, so it would be a simple matter to scale it.<br/><br/>&gt; ... because you seem to be already creating exactly the kind of visualization I wanted<br/>It's still the kind of visualization I'd like too! Unfortunately I've stopped working on it at least for the near future since I hit a realization that it was going to be impractical for me to finish it on my own in random bits of free time I had e.g. between jobs (basically all the work on it was done during these times), and ran out of ideas for securing funding.<br/><br/>So there will probably never be an actual release, but I may open source and write a high level guide to the concepts / architecture / code etc.<br/><br/>Thanks for the kind remarks, and I'll keep an eye out for future videos!

Sorry for my late replies now, I was busy making <a href="https://youtu.be/wdf6S6oumH8">my 5th video</a>. <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Andrew Reece</span>, thanks for letting me know about the Dion project! Like many people here, I've been enthusiastic about the potential of "structured editors" for a long time, but I had not heard about Dion specifically until now, and it seems to be more active and further along than other projects I've heard of in that category. The video gave me lots of thoughts - about the cool animated caret, the tabs vs spaces, the zooming, and the unsolved challenges mentioned towards the end. Guess I should reach out to the team with my feedback!

&gt; yep, game development background<br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@westoncb</span>, aha, I knew it! :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>&gt; ... allowing users to reach a point where control of the software becomes nearly an entirely subconscious process<br/>Well said. I think a lot about the constraint in games to maintain interactive speed, to make sure the code can robustly handle a cascade of quick successive inputs. It pains me to see professionals like for example store clerks or doctors, who use the same computer programs every day, when they're forced to work with slow programs. For example I often see them experience unpredictable delays after some keypresses, and some inputs may be lost, or queued up and applied later in the wrong context. Such bad systems prevent them from ever reaching that level of subconscious fluency.<br/><br/>&gt; ... so I didn't get the interesting "zoomed out map" kind of effect shown in your demo.<br/>Well, let's try it! Here's a <a href="https://emilprogviz.com/stretchy-code-map/tiled_text_take1.html">quick&amp;dirty mockup</a> of what I had in mind and tried to describe in my previous comment. (I hope I don't come off as if I'm on some crusade to try to convince you to resume work on a nightmare jumble of 10 year old java - I just find it interesting to discuss the design, and who knows what else this might inspire!)<br/><br/>And then I thought of a possible disadvantage with the whole stretchy-map idea: it might become tempting for the user to try to read the really tiny text, by squinting and leaning forward. In that case, this layout might contribute to headaches and bad posture. Hard to tell from playing with a "lorem ipsum" prototype for 10 sec.<br/><br/>&gt; ... impractical for me to finish it on my own in random bits of free time<br/>I see. It's hard indeed to work on projects over a certain size in one's spare time. I'm in an amazing position for my side projects right now thanks to Sweden's generous Covid crisis support package, but even 12 months of part-time leave isn't enough for half the things I'd like to do. Anyway, wish I was rich enough to fund you! The world needs a tool like Lucidity, they just don't know it yet. Thumbs up for considering open sourcing it, even in an unfinished state.

Very cool mockup <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Emil H</span>! I feel like this would actually be a pretty useful way to get rapid top-down understanding of a piece of code, though it is hard to tell without actually working with it (I see what you mean about the squinting issue, but there may be ways to mitigate it. Also, it would only display in this style in an "overview" mode or something and an editor could let you rapidly switch between that and normal view. I think once you're ready to start e.g. editing a particular function you may not want the varying sizes).<br/><br/>As far as navigation however, I think the hierarchy from Tiled Text style control just requires too many inputs—at least on desktop. (I think the tradeoff potentially works on e.g. mobile or VR where you can't be as precise, so it's okay to make up for it with additional keypresses to navigate hierarchy (as opposed to painfully attempting to place your cursor between specific characters with e.g. hand-tracking))<br/><br/>I definitely need to take more of the quick and dirty prototype approach in the future—it's very cool to be able to more concretely examine some of these ideas over such a short space of time. Also interesting how little bits of missing context can still make it difficult to evaluate though..

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Emil H</span> just stumbled on your work. It’s very nice! I like how you explain ideas starting from principles.<br/><br/><a href="https://makepad.dev">makepad.dev</a> comes to mind with the text folding. When you load that editor, press the opt key (on mac at least). I think code folding is something that feels underused but I haven’t thought more deeply why I feel that way. I believe makepad works off text indentation, which seems crude but maybe effective?<br/><br/>Of your demos, I like the approach in tiled_text_take1. The stretchy ones are a little disorientating to me. Maybe there’s too much movement? I’m curious how it’d feel with changing text opacity (fade out less important content).<br/><br/>I’ve gone down a similar path of thinking about code tools. Here are some links that might be of interest. Many overlap with the ideas you present :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/><a href="https://artifacts.bypaulshen.com/code-explorer/01/">https://artifacts.bypaulshen.com/code-explorer/01/</a><br/><a href="https://artifacts.bypaulshen.com/code-explorer/02/">https://artifacts.bypaulshen.com/code-explorer/02/</a><br/><a href="https://artifacts.bypaulshen.com/code-explorer/03/">https://artifacts.bypaulshen.com/code-explorer/03/</a><br/><a href="https://artifacts.bypaulshen.com/code-explorer/04/">https://artifacts.bypaulshen.com/code-explorer/04/</a><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/_paulshen/status/1361761506690433027">https://twitter.com/_paulshen/status/1361761506690433027</a>

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@westoncb</span>, glad you like it! Agree that switching between this view and normal view should be quick and easy. A friend suggested a fix for the squinting issue: below a certain font size, transform all letters and numbers into identical rectangles so one simply can't read them and thus won't be tempted to try. The shape of the code would still be visible, and maybe structural characters like <tt>(){}</tt>.<br/><br/>Regarding navigation, I agree, so one interesting question to me is: could there be an even better/faster type of navigation than what we currently have on desktop? I have a hunch that eye tracking is part of the solution. What could be faster than looking at the target? But since eye tracker accuracy is low, we'd then use keyboard for final fine adjustment. Also, maybe some of the hierarchical style of navigation from Tiled Text could could complement our usual keyboard commands. I mean, Vim has "go to next [" so maybe we could also have "go to parent", "go to next sibling block" and such. Or maybe this already exists in some editor, I don't know...

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Paul Shen</span>, thanks! I'll try to continue explaining from principles.<br/><br/>Wow, so makepad.dev actually implements code font size zooming!  It always seemed like an obvious idea, so I wondered why no one had implemented it yet - guess I just didn't look hard enough. But the devil is in the details. I can understand why you'd find my "stretchy" demos disorienting - everything is shifting at the same time, nothing is stable... By changing text opacity, do you mean changing <em>both</em> font size <em>and</em> opacity together, so that small text = low opacity? Or something else?<br/><br/>I also think code folding feels underused, and I've thought a bit about why. First of all, I think we can divide code folding into 2 subcategories. One is the general "zoom out" type of view in makepad.dev or the start screen in my tiled_text_take1. It seems good and unproblematic. The other category is when the user manually chooses which code sections to fold. It's a different use case. For example, if I have a long file with the functions A, B, C and D in that order, and now I want to read A and D, but I currently don't care about B and C in between so I fold them. One problem I have is the amount of work required to fold them. I either have to move my caret to the correct row and hit some awkward keyboard command, or I have to use the mouse and hit a tiny icon. In the <a href="https://media.handmade-seattle.com/dion-systems/">Dion project</a>, they solve this use case with "slices" instead - one writes a small piece of special code which simply lists which functions one wants to see. Everything else is hidden while viewing the slice. But I feel like this is even more work than folding by mouse click. But the main problem I have with code folding in current editors is that the hidden block becomes <em>too</em> hidden. We get absolutely no clue about how large it is or what it does. The "thumbnail" idea would hint at the block size, while the "function signature" idea in my <a href="https://youtu.be/wdf6S6oumH8">5th video</a> would hint at what the block does from an input-output perspective.<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing your links. Indeed, there's lots of overlap between our work! :grinning: The differences are worth thinking more about, too.... This deserves a longer reply. I'll be back!
