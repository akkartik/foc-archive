Hi all! I'm <a href="https://www.andyta.ng/">Andy</a>, a student currently studying robot learning and AI for real-world/verifiable tasks. I've previously crossed paths with several (generally more experienced / into HCI) folks in circles like these, and given my interest in these subjects I thought I'd join and hopefully meet some cool people! In terms of experience, I've been coding all my life, previously interned at Replit---which really changes your perspective on the conventional idea of who is a coder---and generally spawn side projects fast enough that they get shoved in a document so I don't try to act on all of them at once and leave them all half-finished.<br/><br/>Topics of interest include voice and physical interaction modalities, computer history (fun fact: according to <em><a href="http://friendlyorangeglow.com/">Friendly Orange Glow</a></em> my high school was a significant source of programmers for the PLATO system), and generative software ideas. Excited to meet you all!
