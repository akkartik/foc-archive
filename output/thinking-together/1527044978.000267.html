Alan Kay and Jim Coplien (via his DCI paradigm) helped me to realize that things could (and should!) be much better; Bret Victor showed me that it could be done, and in a way that is now human-oriented than I ever thought possible before. Bret, Jim, and Christopher Alexander helped me shift my view from an obsession of the technical and mechanical, to one focused on humans and a moral imperative to improve the way we shape the world with software. I've become especially interested in exploring the human component, and have found parallels in physical architecture, City planning, and design in general, which I constantly link back to software. Perhaps I'll share some later, but I'm say that much of the problems we see in software, also exist in the physical &amp; built world, and in both cases the real solution is to stop substituting superficial technical goodness in place of real usability &amp; human "goodness"
