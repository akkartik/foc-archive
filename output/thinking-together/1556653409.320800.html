<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tom Lieber</span> has written great notes from Rich Hickey's <em>Simple Made Easy</em> talk (<a href="http://alltom.com/pages/best-lectures/#simple-made-easy">http://alltom.com/pages/best-lectures/#simple-made-easy</a>). Even though I've already watched it twice, I realized from these notes that I could use a refresher. It's so great. Some great points he makes that I had forgotten about:<br/><br/>• simple/complex is objective (not interleaved with something else)<br/>• easy/hard is subjective (how near at hand or familiar it is to what you already know)<br/>• • We spend too much time debating the easiness (or familiarity) of various approaches. Familiarity is subjective so it's a useless debate. Simplicity is an objective thing to shoot for.<br/>• We are overly focused on easy (quick/convenient and familiar)<br/>• There's a tradeoff (from Sussman) between our understanding of a system and its flexibility<br/>• The human brain is limited to understand a few things at a time, so if things are interbraided, you can't understand it them in isolation. You need to examine multiple things at the same time, which limits your understanding<br/>• Easy gives you early speed (like a sprinter) but simplicity gives you long-term productivity (marathoner)<br/>• Many things that are easy/familiar are very complex, such as OOP concepts. Functional programming replaces a lot of easy/complex concepts with hard(unfamiliar)/simple ones.<br/>• Complect is to interleave, entwine, braid. It's bad: don't do it.<br/>• Compose means to place together, and this is the right way to do it.<br/>• Modularity and simplicity is key, but you have to make sure things are actually independent and not just hiding the dependencies by moving the code around<br/>• State complects value and time. (FRP allows you to untangle these two with Event/Behavior types account for time properly.)<br/><li> "But programming, when stripped of all its circumstantial irrelevancies, boils down to no more and no less than very effective thinking so as to avoid unmastered complexity, to very vigorous separation of your many different concerns." - Dijkstra<br/><li> “You have to start developing sensibilities around entanglement. You have to have entanglement radar. You wanna look at some software and say ‘Ugh!’ Not that I don't like the names you used, or the shape of the code, or there was a semi-colon… That's also important too, but you want to start seeing complecting. <b>You want to start seeing interconnections between things that could be independent.</b>” (59:10)
