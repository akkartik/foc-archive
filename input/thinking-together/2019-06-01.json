(visual hash)\n* Filtering that highlights relevant nodes by dependencies, function, etc\n* Slow motion, time machine\n* Forking and comparing changes: multiple variations of a change running concurrently (imagine 3 variants of a component laid out side-by-side)\n* Topography-based diffing for version control.\n* Test paths: selecting a path with test input (eg table) and output components (eg. chart), straightened out and annotated.\n* Edge bundles: connecting certain types of nodes may require multiple connections between them. These should be nameable and marked differently."
