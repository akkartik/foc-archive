Thinking more about the wires crossing problem (from Adnan's "portal" conversation) that plagues every node and wire GUI tool after log 2, I was wondering if anyone has seen any great GUI tools that use a "Tube" model instead. The idea is nodes would always have a single parent, and a fixed x/y position, and be connected to their parent by a tube, in which unlimited wires might be threaded. Messages between nodes would have to route according to these layouts (each node would have routing capability). To see the exact connections between nodes, you would likely have to hover over a node and it's relevant wired connections could highlight. Does the EE world have GUI tools that follow a paradigm like this?

A thing about this that I immediately dislike is it's not clear what the meaning is for there to be a tube between A and 1 (and not, for example, between B and 1). It seems like having all of the nodes off of the root would be less arbitrary, but then you might as well not even have the root/tubes since they give no information.

Wire crossing in a node-and-wire language probably serves the same useful purpose as "code smells" in other languages: as a signal that you should refactor or that the level of abstraction of the nodes needs to be raised.

I definitely see the appeal of this approach. It sort of feels like a mix of two things..<br/>1. "Braiding" multiple wires together<br/>2. A bus network<br/>I definitely won't balk at specifics of your example, since that seems like approaching the idea at the wrong level of detail. More broadly though: I think the thing that'd be required to make this work well is the same thing that'd be required to make regular old node-and-wire work well — a really, really polished UI. Now, it might be easier to do a really polished UI with something like tubes, since the concept might switch out some hard to solve problems (a visual rats nest) with some easier to solve problems (showing a subset of paths).<br/><br/>Neat to think about.

I think the secret to any good diagram is having close relationships between an underlying invariant/axiom/rule and some visual feature. This is what allows them to be learnt. For example, "if node A is to the left of node B, then B is not an input to A", "if node A is bigger than node B then it has more outputs".<br/><br/>In your tube example it's not obvious what these rules are, so while it's very uncluttered it's not (to my untrained eyes), clear.

Maybe if you moved the nodes so that, e.g., D was horizontally between 3 and 4, it would be obvious that D is NOT an input to 1, 2, 3 but it might be an input to 4 (hover to check)

I'll second <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jared Windover</span>, I don't immediately understand this Tube Layout.  I am sort of a fan of "nodes would always have ... a fixed x/y position."  More than that, I really like having strong rules about orientation.  Often you don't have a generic graphs, trees and DAGs are more common.  Following the top left to bottom right flow suggested by your Graph Layout, we can choose to omit most of the arrows.

The black lines are there to show non-adjacent connections.  A different background color could be used to show edges that violate the normal flow.<br/><br/>Also messy graphs tend to arise when you have a lot of connections between two similar layers: a bunch of similar As all connected to a bunch of similar Bs.  braiding edges or stacking nodes can help in those situations.<br/><br/>Lastly, long distance edges are usually a sign that the distant edge is being used as a word, like a library call, and its connection to the rest of the network is more tenuous.

Yeah from a UX pov I think it's much less readable than conventional node graphs.<br/>Agreed with William, locking node positions does sound really nice, and some software like SpeedTree actually have (or used to? haven't used it in ages) that constraint: you're not allowed to move the nodes freely in the graph, you just add them as you need them, and the layout sorts their position for you.<br/><br/>Though to be fair, this software literally makes trees, which are just ideal for node graphs :smile:

A small feature that I have tried in the past, is "focus-mode".. when you select a node, that the directly connected nodes and wires are also highlighted and the rest of the graph is dimmed. In my current implementation I have to re-implement this feature, as it was quite helpful

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Maikel van de Lisdonk</span> we have something similar where if you drag a wire, we highlight all the nodes + wires in the graph that can accept the connection.<br/><br/>We did the focus mode thing but users often selected nodes to just check values or move them around, and the constant highlight/dim made the graph look like a Christmas tree at times :smile:

To get back on topic; <span style="background-color:#ccf">@breck7</span> another issue that I noticed with the tubing model is that if ABC happen to need "2", in case 2 holds some value that they all need, all hell breaks loose :smile: you suddenly get back to the wire crossing problem, which I'm not sure how this tubing model would solve.<br/><br/>A portal system could solve this, but portals are delicate and if you overuse them, which would be a necessity in this case, you end up losing the benefit of a tree structure readability, as a property called by the leaf could also happen to be used on a branch, root or anywhere else.

My understanding was that B would have access to 2 by following the tube back to the root, through A, through 1, and then to 2.
