I'm really excited about the WHLSL news out of WebKit (<a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8482/web-high-level-shading-language/">https://webkit.org/blog/8482/web-high-level-shading-language/</a>). Looks like the WebGPU project is maturing. Not quite as close to the metal as the RTX stuff mentioned above, but exciting for the sake of bringing a low-overhead graphics API to the masses, and putting it within reach of web developers (as opposed to game/app developers).<br/><br/>For the <em>future of coding</em> angle on this #of-graphics stuff, my company does a lot of interactive graphics, and I'm working on a visual programming language to support some of that. It's a nice domain to be in, since there's a tighter connection between the language and the result than there would be if (say) I were making a language for correctness validation or serving web apps. I'd be excited to hear if anyone else here is working on/with tools/languages that have a strong component of graphics to them.

I'm suprised at the design though.. I personally prefer HLSL syntax over GLSL, but it is a weird choice to base it on HLSL when the web is already using GLSL, and the two are largely equivalent.. and the new features it adds seem mostly very inconsequential syntactic sugar
