Pure computation is pure all the way down, an advantage of this is the ability to verify a result by just putting the inputs in again. This is useful in the real world if you share a result with someone: for example when a bank tells a customer how much their mortgage repayment costs<br/><br/>It works not just for one result of interest, but for every other result that one depends on: in other words for the complete workings. So by sharing the pure computation code and it's inputs along with a number, the number is verifiable and you've also shared the complete workings (for free).<br/><br/>I exploit this as much as I can in calculang, including while developing models, with reactive visualizations showing me current model behavior for some inputs (with controls; all experimental at this stage).<br/><br/>It surprises me that on developer tools, functional programming is not in it's own league in front. There are some application state developer tools that FP techniques enable and some are influential. But I don't know anything about interesting introspection- or validation type tools that especially exploit purity. Anyone know if I'm missing something in particular or have any good references to read on?<br/><br/>I might consider a POC exploration on just this idea for some other language (maybe Haskell or PureScript but open to thoughts)
