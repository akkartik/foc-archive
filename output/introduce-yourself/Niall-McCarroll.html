Hi all.  I'm Niall, working as a research software engineer currently.  In the past I worked on visual programming tools (node-and-link variety) and picked up some experience of what can work and what may not.<br/><br/>I'm currently working on an open source framework (python/javascript) to help users apply visual programming to explore and process earth observation (EO) data.  I'm also starting to look at some other application areas (building database queries and deep/transfer learning) to see if the framework can be re-usable.<br/><br/>Interested to find out what other folks in this community are working on and share ideas!<br/><br/>All the best!<br/>Cheers<br/>N
