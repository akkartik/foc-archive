Surely someone has made a language with this design choice before (rationals and <b>no</b> *floats*)? I don't know of any examples.<br/>(Floats could be hidden in an "advanced menu" for backwards-compatibility and special needs only)<br/><br/>Edit: I guess Scheme and Racket have "exact numbers" (rationals), though they have floats as well, and transcendental functions like sin() and cos() will return floats instead of approximated rationals, so you can't really escape using floats.
