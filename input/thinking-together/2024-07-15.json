Take for instance the conversation that happens between law makers and judges. A law is drafted, there are disputes over how to interpret it, in part fueled by examples of differing interpretations from administrative decision makers. Those differences in interpretation can help people know on what grounds they might object to a particular decision. Those objections go to judges, and judges might differ again, which has the same effect. And the differing interpretations of the judges in the context of things worth arguing about brings to legislators' attention places where the rule itself is both problematic from a fairness and\/or interpretation standpoint, and where that problem causes significant issues in the real world, equipping them with information about where to focus when considering amendments.

But it is a coherent argument about what is lost, and how, from consistent automated application of laws, and it is prescriptive about where and how rules as code should best be applied to avoid those losses.

I view this view as being too restrictive. Programming is more than just commanding a machine with sequentialistic instructions. Programming a *CPU*, though, is - by definition - sequentialistic. But,,, programming a *machine(s)* need not be sequentialistic. Especially in the age of nothing-is-central. In fact, LLMs are an example of non-sequentialism. The machines that run LLMs were programmed, arduously, in sequential notation, but, the inner success of LLMs is not sequential, but something else (massively parallel plinko?).\n\nVPLs and DPLs are, to me, not sequentialistic things. Maybe they should be called “notations” instead of “languages”? VNP and DNP? Visual Notation for Programming, Diagrammatic Notation for Programming? [In which case, “programming languages” as we know them, are TNPs - Textual Notations for Programming].\n\nIn fact, programming is not the difficult part. Re-programming is the novel aspect of Design that computers bring to the world. We have been programming machines to do *single* things for centuries (using metal lathes, etc.). This time through, though, we have built machines capable of doing *many* things.",

Yet, relational languages do not solve - cleanly - the problems of (a) formatting a string (JavaScript does it better than relational languages :-), (b) parsing text (OhmJS \/ PEG does it better), (c) etc. I argue that we need to compose programs using many languages, each tuned for specific purposes (paradigms).
