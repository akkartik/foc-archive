I built Postman as a side-project and thanks to the support of the dev community has grown to become a powerful tool used by more than 5 million people. I am super passionate about development easier, faster, and more accessible to everyone. I came across <http:\/\/futureofcoding.org|futureofcoding.org> recently and thought it’d be great to join the community and learn more from everyone. We have several challenges in meeting the needs of devs (new and expert) and I am always curious about new ideas!",
