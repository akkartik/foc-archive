Is entrepreneurship a trap? No; right now, it's one of the only ways to avoid being trapped

&gt; Sure, I have customers to assist, servers to manage (not that they need much management), and business accounting to do; but professors equally have classes to teach, students to supervise, and committees to attend<br/>If you’re going to equate teaching / supervising students with business accounting, then it’s probably safe to say academia is the wrong field to enter.

Might vary by field or, more likely, institution but for some students are absolutely viewed as a tax.
