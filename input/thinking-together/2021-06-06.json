We stay in control, and our cognitive abilities are amplified.\n\nAfter all, people who use tools like Roam Research are “just” modeling certain parts of their individual thinking process and the tool gives them an environment to structure their thoughts in, which is remarkably similar to designing a data model, except that it requires much more flexibility and dynamism than what we computer people think of when we talk about a “data model”.\n\nFrom that perspective the overlap is huge.

Not attempting to do the thinking for us, or automate away thinking, but augmenting and enhancing our capabilities to understand, ideate, and explore. We stay in control, and our cognitive abilities are amplified.\n\nAfter all, people who use tools like Roam Research are “just” modeling certain parts of their individual thinking process and the tool gives them an environment to structure their thoughts in, which is remarkably similar to designing a data model, except that it requires much more flexibility and dynamism than what we computer people think of when we talk about a “data model”.\n\nFrom that perspective the overlap is huge. I do acknowledge, however, that this is just a narrow definition of both tools for thought and the future of programming, and there are plenty of other areas to explore in both."

So it's good to take the, usually incorrect, \"how can is this even possible\" value and just follow its data-flow but with surrounding context because (1) you're probably looking for a control flow branch not taken and (2) the data-flow tree itself is liable to be extra bushy yet easily pruned.  In contrast, stepping forward has the problem that a lot of initialization\/configuration happens, especially in framework code, which is noisy and mostly irrelevant.\n\nAnd for pure reverse execution, the trick is to automatically lift functions so that they pass whatever data is necessary to run in reverse in a hidden channel.  In general `f' x = (f x, x)` works, but sometimes you can use shortcuts.  But then you might as well use checkpoints like most people do.  And the `f'` above isn't so useful since it's referentially transparent and the whole point is that you want to look inside `f`.",

So it's good to take the, usually incorrect, \"how can is this even possible\" value and just follow its data-flow but with surrounding context because (1) you're probably looking for a control flow branch not taken and (2) the data-flow tree itself is liable to be extra bushy yet easily pruned.  In contrast, stepping forward has the problem that a lot of initialization\/configuration happens, especially in framework code, which is noisy and mostly irrelevant.\n\nAnd for pure reverse execution, the trick is to automatically lift functions so that they pass whatever data is necessary to run in reverse in a hidden channel.
