I’m using this both for ease of initial development and ease of _future_ development: if the frontend or backend become restrictive, there is the option for me or others to write new or additional frontends\/backends in different technologies.\n\nThe backend is currently a “normal” Ruby on Rails API backed by Postgres. To support self-hosting, I will want to set it up to be easy to spin up new instances on Docker or Heroku (which is where I currently host it). _Hosting_ the app isn’t for non-programmers\/non-IT people, due to the limitations of the underlying technologies. But this question has gotten me thinking of the tradeoffs of other backend technologies: Golang would allow shipping a single binary, but does not allow folks to easily verify the code included in that binary.\n\nThe frontend is built on React Native, using the `react-native-web` package to also target web with the same frontend codebase. I want to set up the mobile clients to be configurable to access any backend, so that you don’t _have_ to publish your own mobile app, but you have the option to if you make feature changes to it. There’s some _developer_ burden keeping it up-to-date (it’s a heavy stack). For someone hosting, the frontend web updates would hopefully be as simple as keeping Node up-to-date and running an `npm install`. TBD how much interest the project gets; if\/when some folks start self-hosting I know I’ll need to put more attention to ensuring they have a good experience.\n\nAny followup thoughts or questions you have based on that would be welcome!
