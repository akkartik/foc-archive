As I said, I'm not suggesting betting on any one person to lead TheSolution(tm). I agree (and it's also Steve's position) that the future is in many people collaborating and sharing together, and or would be a message to all come together and try to decide on the one "best" way; because who really knows? And that limits perspective and potential.<br/><br/>BUT, the position Steve is in for bringing many different efforts together, and basically being responsible for starting the most successful community I've come across (and I guess even the big guys are giving some level of acknowledgement there) ... We make that succeed, we help Steve be in the best position to help foster that as best he can ... maybe you see what I'm saying?<br/><br/>It's about the many people many efforts many perspectives, but this place (and Steve's pain to spread awareness and explore and share the connections between a lot of it) has probably done the best good in terms of that effort, for what it is.
