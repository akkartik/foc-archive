Creating complexity is just a natural consequence of not understanding a domain yet. It's not about techies or even people. All sophonts will do it.<br/><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari</a><br/><br/>The key is to allow backing out complexity when it becomes apparent that it's unnecessary.

I like the metaphor, also Eastern, of learning as a circle, with the beginner at  0, the expert at 180, and the master at 360, returning to the simplicity of the beginner.<br/><br/>“In the martial art of Karate, for instance, the symbol of pride for a black belt is to wear it long enough such that the die fades to white as to symbolize returning to the beginner state”. — John Maeda<br/><br/>The problem with programming is that it is dominated by the brash young experts who relish power complexity. Because of demographics and ageism we have few masters.
