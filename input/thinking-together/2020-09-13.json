We found that the generation of our parents (born in the 50s early 60s) didn't have a DIY culture at all.\n\nFrom real experience:\n• If you're bike is broken :\nParents =&gt; bring it to the bike shop\nUs =&gt; Watch a youtube tutorial\n• You want to organize a trip:\nParent =&gt; Contact a local travel agent\nUs =&gt; Do some research, go on Sky Scanner, try to find local guides, <http:\/\/booking.com|booking.com>...\n\nI was also talking to my step dad about it, who was also leaning to the same conclusion, He was amazed that kids of our generation all seem to cook. He is a city guy from Italy, he never cooked for himself. Being a bit counter-cultural he associated cooking yourself with the older more repressive generation (he was a bit of a hippy).  And maybe we are doing the same things he did, we cook because our parents didn't.\n\nI think there might be some vertical and also horizontal cultural differences. Most of my friends come from cities\/big towns and we are Europeans. There might be different shift depending on your generation\/location.",

In fact, that's one way to diagnose all of us pushing back on you in this thread: we've been living with our chains so long that we've forgotten about them. That would certainly explain why we don't customize more.\n\nThis seems to be saying the same thing I am, experienced programmers are unhappy with their tools, but accept them (that's the way I'm interpreting \"resigned\" at least?) The question is just why. You've given some great reasons, but I'm not entirely convinced (not saying I disagree either, just not sure either way), but I think the best response would be to give some concrete examples. That's also something a couple of others have requested too, and I also think it's a good idea, so I'm going to start a new thread soon with examples.\n\n&gt; I had more customizations in 2001-2005, then I moved and changed a lot of stuff and just restarted my text editor settings from scratch. And they've never grown back to the sort of multi-megabyte state they were in then.\n\nI used off-the-shelf software for the first half of my career (2002-2010), mainly with the defaults, then started customizing after that. I realized it solved a really really big problem for me: I used to keep changing software because an alternative would solve some problem I have, but after using the new software I'd realize the old software did some other things better. So my total number of problems would always stay the same.\n\nNow that I customize, my total number of problems goes down. Now I think of applications like as a shell that I can customize to make it do the things that are important to me very quickly. And I'm so much happier as a computer user this way, because I'm not in a constant state of frustration because nothing works the way I want it to like I was before (this is is probably a core trait of customizers\/automators, as well as contrarians in general).\n\n&gt; &gt; I think you're misunderstanding me here, I'm specifically saying I don't always think automation is a good idea, I'm saying that it's the way I prefer to solve problems. It's an inclination that has more to do with me, than it does the problem.\n&gt; I don't understand the distinction you're making here. At least, what you're saying sounds like it answers your earlier question, \"how can doing things manually still be better than automating them in 2020?\"\n\nTo me these are two separate thoughts: In the first, I'd guesstimate automators are about 1\/10 of programmers, I'm just saying I'm in that 1\/10. The second part is just surprise that using a computer programmatically is still so difficult in 2020, given it's a problem so many people have worked on. Not sure there's a contradiction here? I think you're saying #2 leads to the 1\/10 in #1, which I agree with. But I don't see why that would change my personal preference?\n\n&gt; When I do something manually I sleep soundly at night that I haven't created new tech debt for myself. I don't have something new I have to maintain, or try to read later to try to understand just what I was thinking. Manual labor can be therapeutic, like gardening. All these things have nothing to do with the state of the underlying system. They're just about the mess I make, and about taking care of my own state of mind.\n\nI understand this in theory, but I just don't experience using computers this way. This reminds me of how I feel when I watch Gray Bernhardt type, I find him amazing to watch, but he has an affinity for the mechanical act of typing that I just do not share. I find just imagining doing what he does myself exhausting. (Also, doing that many small mechanical motions relative to his output seems like a recipe for RSI to me.) There is just no way I'm ever going to use a computer by typing everything out the way he does, the \"cost of a key stroke\" is just higher for me than it is for him.",

I certainly agree that computers today fit better for people with a certain profile (who find certain things like typing cheaper to do), and that there are huge barriers to customizing them for other profiles. I think it analogous to the direction of a vector rather than its magnitude. The things you want are not that far from the current defaults, it's just that there's huge impassable mountains in the direction you want to take computers, whereas I[1] and Gary Bernhardt have the advantage of living in the direction of the flat plains.

I certainly agree that computers today fit better for people with a certain profile (who find certain things like typing cheaper to do), and that there are huge barriers to customizing them for other profiles. I think it analogous to the direction of a vector rather than its magnitude. The things you want are not that far from the current defaults, it's just that there's huge impassable mountains in the direction you want to take computers, whereas I[1] and Gary Bernhardt have the advantage of living in the direction of the flat plains. (And the poor laypeople are out in outer space with no service.)\n\n[1] Though I see myself moving closer to you over time, what with my recent RSI troubles."

Natural language is our primary means of understanding the world and interacting with other humans, especially in the absence of supplementary tools such as pen-and-paper (e.g. in face-to-face conversation). When was the last time you described a cause-and-effect phenomenon (a story, event, or task instructions) to someone without extensive use of natural language? At best, we use other artifacts (diagrams, formal models) as aids.\n\nDespite the ubiquity and utility of natural language, if one person tries to \"speak\" a Java\/C\/JS\/Rust program to another person, they have to go through an extremely complicated and lossy translation process from *code* to *words*. Based on some of my recent design work (not shared yet), I'm beginning to believe we could actually design programming languages whose \"source code\" consists *solely* of *terse* natural language sentences\/structures with *very specific* syntax restrictions (to deny multiple interpretations \/ ambiguities). The language would not be accompanied by any supplementary symbols (!@#$%^&amp;]\/-&gt;) with domain-specific meaning, since those would inhibit verbalization. Writing code in this language still requires careful deliberation (to develop the logic), but _reading_ and _discussing_ code with full verbalization becomes trivial: no translation is required at all!\n\nYes, I'm not the first person to think about putting natural language in PLs. Someone might bring up COBOL, HyperTalk, SQL, or similar. I'm not saying verbalizability is \"the solution\" to programming alone, but along with a well-crafted semantics (information model etc.), it could lead to something extraordinary.\n\nIf anyone wants to think further about this, Felienne Hermans <https:\/\/youtu.be\/CgR5mSAGxtA?t=2663|discusses verbalization\/vocalization of PLs as part of a larger talk> (video is timestamped to that bit).
