<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4DlqsxdOfY&amp;t=4212">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4DlqsxdOfY&amp;t=4212</a><br/><br/>There's a new glitch that was discovered in Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time a few months ago, which was exhibited live as part of the Games Done Quick speedrunning charity marathon last week. This glitch is an incredible feat of both reverse engineering and virtuosic game input, and the commentators do a good job of explaining what happens. For those who aren't gamers this might not carry much significance, but for anyone who plays games in general or Ocarina of Time in particular this should be a real head trip.<br/><br/>This category of speedrun is "100% no source requirement", which means the runner needs to acquire every single item in the game, but that item doesn't need to be acquired from its original source. This glitch is the skeleton key that unlocks every item in the game.<br/><br/>All the below is explained better by the video, so if you're interested you should watch that instead of reading this.<br/><br/>In summary, the glitch works by abusing the boomerang, a chest, and water. There's a deku scrub that gives Link a heart. ZFG (the player) collects that heart with the boomerang. The boomerang "moves" the heart by copying the boomerang's position to the heart's position every frame. Through a series of very careful inputs, ZFG causes the game to unload the heart from memory while it's being boomeranged, and load something else (Zelda's Letter) in its place, causing the boomerang to write position values on that object instead. ZFG then causes a room with a chest to load exactly when the boomerang is in a very precise position, so that the chest ends up containing the item being carried by the boomerang. This item is normally never found inside a chest, so when Link collects this item from the chest, the game actually ends up giving Link a <em>different</em> item — and which item Link receives is determined by the angle (in 256th increments) Link is facing. By repeatedly going out bounds, dying, and being revived by a fairy, ZFG tricks the game into thinking Link is underwater when he's not, and is able to collect multiple specific items from the chest.<br/><br/>No way in hell would I post this to #thinking-together :P

one thing that i would be excited by for a wiki would be just a very niche gaming/speedrunning channel. probably too small for a slack channel but from an n of 2 there are a few people who’d go very deep on it

Well, I mean.. there are other speedrunning communities out there that are <em>thriving</em>. Personally, I enjoy watching SGDQ and AGDQ, and occasionally I like to re-play a game and try to "go fast", but that's where my interest stops. (I'm assuming you were referring to me as the other n, haha)

i meant specifically from an FoC perspective—a lot of interesting stuff about how people learn to use and abuse interfaces and discover glitches

Not sure I see the relevance — when speedrunning folks touch code, it tends to be assembly and decompiled C and such. Even if they're using "nice" tools to do it, it's still like... the cone of their vision is not at all overlapping the stuff we're all looking at.

Same with, say, demoscene. It's neat, it's way out there, but it's not related to what we're doing IMO.

Oh, I love speedruns too. Have you heard about the controller-based arbitrary code execution exploit in Super Mario World? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB6eY73sLV0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB6eY73sLV0</a>

Yes! They demoed it live (as a TAS) at GDQ. Awesome stuff.
