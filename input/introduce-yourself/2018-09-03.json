So glad that I found a place with people that share my passion.\nHey <@UC2A2ARPT>, glad that you're also here.\n\nMy name is Vladimir and I live in Russia, currently in Saint Petersburg.\nI always loved programming languages and was curious about alternative ways to program.\n\nSome years ago I became fascinated by Bret Victor's ideas, especially his \"Future Programming\" and \"Seeing Spaces\" talks.\nThis realization that is not technology's fault that we don't have better tools, but just lack of culture, improper attitude -- it felt really striking.\nSo I wanted to contribute to development of this new culture somehow. Introduce this thinking into daily life.\n\nAs a full-time employee I had to work on my projects on weekends.\nI would love to do it full time. In order to get that I need to turn project into something commercial.\nSomething that makes people ready to pay to stop the pain of alternative.\n\nSo I tried to create a \"Seeing tool\" for debugging (not Seeing Space though). A tool that captures trace events for Erlang\/OTP platform and visualizes them.\nMakes it easier to understand what's happening. Allows to skip the pain of reading hundreds of lines of text logs. It may save hundreds of working hours.\nI choosed Erlang\/OTP first because underlying model of isolated processes and message passing is really easy to visualize and manipulate with.\nSecond because it provides powerful tracing API, that makes it very easy to start. And third: I already had experience working in production with Erlang and I loved it.\n\nI took a couple of months break and worked on Batiscaph project: <https:\/\/github.com\/vladimir-vg\/batiscaph>\nHere is the demo video: <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VNr7o9eg4Ck>\n\nI got a working prototype, yet it's far from being useful in production.\nI realized that road to commercializing this project is really long, may take years.\nI stopped this project for now and thinking about shorter ways of bringing new thinking into daily life.\n\nCurrently I'm thinking about new medium for software and hypermedia (That's why I was reading <@UA8HY8R7B> zells logs: <https:\/\/github.com\/zells\/project\/tree\/master\/log>).\nGot one exciting idea about it. Also it might be easily connected to something not programming related, something that people use in daily life, thus bigger market and maybe easier commercialization.",
