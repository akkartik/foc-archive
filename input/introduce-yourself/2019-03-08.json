I was highly encouraged to check out Future of Coding by <@UFPPABQ7P> who designs, pitches, and develops digital products at Reaktr Inc. in NYC.\n\nI am a recent graduate from the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) with a bachelor's of liberal arts degree and a minor in healing arts and humanities. I leverage a dynamic background in research, R-programming, and professional nursing theory to champion high spirited teams. I am really comfortable with a variety of technologies and have an enjoyed history of wearing multiple hats.\n\nI love translating complex problems and ideas into practical tools. I think that this Slack has many bright contributors and I find this on-going dialog to be incredibly stimulating. I hope to add value to the experience of being human by incorporating what I learn within this community.\n\n-Zachary\n<mailto:mail@zrsewell.com|mail@zrsewell.com>\n+1 (917) 274-7696\n\n\n\nSidebar: I am slated to move to the NYC area on 03.28.2019 and am open to receiving advice on all things core to surviving (i.e. employment, housing, social circle building; etc.)",

I am really comfortable with a variety of technologies and have an enjoyed history of wearing multiple hats.\n\nI love translating complex problems and ideas into practical tools. I think that this Slack has many bright contributors and I find this on-going dialog to be incredibly stimulating. I hope to add value to the experience of being human by incorporating what I learn within this community.\n\n-Zachary\n"
