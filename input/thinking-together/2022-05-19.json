I’ve found that as I learn more, my tastes change, morph, and expand. What I see in philosophy that I think is wonderful is the incredible diversity of views and yet persistent dialogue going on between these views. Philosophy becomes this rich discussion of trade-offs, of clear conversations driving to find where the true disagreement lies. Programming on the other hand seems to lack this depth.\n\nSo if I have a deep goal, it is a meta goal. To explore many different deep goals. To see many different approaches flourish. To push and understand. To find where real disagreement is rather than superficial. To find connections where others see difference.\n\nI think the things that make us different here are much less important than the things we have in common. What I think matters in those difference is to understand them and to find out the strengths in each approach and to find a way, not to combine them all into some multi-paradigm mess, but to see them all from their perspectives.",

But I don’t have a deep goal, or if I do, it is a deep meta goal.\n\nIn programming and in my other hobby (philosophy). I’ve found that as I learn more, my tastes change, morph, and expand. What I see in philosophy that I think is wonderful is the incredible diversity of views and yet persistent dialogue going on between these views. Philosophy becomes this rich discussion of trade-offs, of clear conversations driving to find where the true disagreement lies. Programming on the other hand seems to lack this depth.\n\nSo if I have a deep goal, it is a meta goal. To explore many different deep goals. To see many different approaches flourish. To push and understand. To find where real disagreement is rather than superficial. To find connections where others see difference.\n\nI think the things that make us different here are much less important than the things we have in common. What I think matters in those difference is to understand them and to find out the strengths in each approach and to find a way, not to combine them all into some multi-paradigm mess, but to see them all from their perspectives."
