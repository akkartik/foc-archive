It's just something I do off and on for fun. \n\nA few years back I tended to work mostly with Unity, but the parts or Unity I enjoyed seem to have stagnated, so I try to avoid it these days.\n\nIn particular, I'm interested in game networking and using the GPU for non-graphics simulation. \n\nAs it pertains to this slack community, I find gpgpu programming particularly interesting. It's a space where there's a real need to move beyond C inspired programming languages that also has very hard performance requirements."
