My point is that LLMs are a method of  instructing a computer. did a digital display on a camera change cameras? The conversation seems at points to equate LLMs with the invention of the camera. I think it’s important to clarify the nature of things as the metaphors can become mixed in ways that only LLMs can :) \n\nRegarding tools and music.. if I play a Bach piece  on a piano, a glockenspiel or a synth what has happened to the essence of the fugue. And if I play it on a sampler that has sampled the original well tempered clavier Bach played it on to a degree of fidelity that is indistinguishable from the original has the tool changed the music? If I manipulate it then with the sampler am I changing music or am I composing? Has music changed? \n\nI was merely drawing attention to where those lines might be as I think it’s important to the discussion. \n",
