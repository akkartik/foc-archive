A full system has many layers. If we are live editing the code at layer N, then the SUD and SIU can share layers 0..N-1, but we fork layers N and above. If we are live editing the GPU driver, we need 2 physical GPUs, one connected to the SUD and one connected to the SIU. We can crash the GPU connected to the driver we are live editing without losing our development environment. If we are live editing the window manager, we don't need two GPUs, the SUD and SIU can share the same GPU driver instance. If we are live editing a declarative description of a new window theme, then, as long as the window theme API is \"safe\", we don't need to fork the window system to apply the new theme."
