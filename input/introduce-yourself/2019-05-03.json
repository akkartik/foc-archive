Back in my philosophy days I thought it might be interesting to run the same kind of \"multiple realizability\" arguments that you find in the philosophy of mind to argue for the non-reducibility of programs to, eg. patterns of activity in the hardware. These days I'm in the typed functional programming camp and like to think of programs as proofs, via the Curry-Howard isomorphism. So the next question is \"what is a proof?\".",

Back in my philosophy days I thought it might be interesting to run the same kind of \"multiple realizability\" arguments that you find in the philosophy of mind to argue for the non-reducibility of programs to, eg. patterns of activity in the hardware. These days I'm in the typed functional programming camp and like to think of programs as proofs, via the Curry-Howard isomorphism. So the next question is \"what is a proof?\"."

Alexander was looking to restore physical architecture to its more humanistic roots (find his video \"spaces for the soul\" on YouTube for more info). His \"pattern language\" theory was actually picked up by the software community, sparking a \"patterns\" movement which essentially sought to find patterns to build software that was more humane and useful to people. The founders of this movement formed \"The Hillside Group\" (find their website).\n\nHowever, \"patterns\" in software quickly devolved into ways to deal with problems in the code (e.g. like shifting from how to build a kitchen or entrance or living room that promotes togetherness while respecting personal space ... to how best to nail drywall to a wood frame). The change was solidified by a book published by 4 authors commonly known as \"The Gang of Four\" (GoF) (look it up, it's not hard to find them). The book and it's more mechanical idea of \"patterns\" still today forms a foundational part of modern software ideology.\n\nWith this flop, some key figures in software (many from the Hillside Group) sought other ways to make software more humanistic, and as a result we have \"Agile\" (see the \"Agile Manifesto\", also easy to find).\n\nThe Christopher Alexander video marks his address to the software community after this patterns movement had gained traction, and the Gang of Four book had taken its course. He talks a lot about his work, and then addresses the disparagement between it and what software has done with it.",

Alexander was looking to restore physical architecture to its more humanistic roots (find his video \"spaces for the soul\" on YouTube for more info). His \"pattern language\" theory was actually picked up by the software community, sparking a \"patterns\" movement which essentially sought to find patterns to build software that was more humane and useful to people. The founders of this movement formed \"The Hillside Group\" (find their website).\n\nHowever, \"patterns\" in software quickly devolved into ways to deal with problems in the code (e.g. like shifting from how to build a kitchen or entrance or living room that promotes togetherness while respecting personal space ... to how best to nail drywall to a wood frame). The change was solidified by a book published by 4 authors commonly known as \"The Gang of Four\" (GoF) (look it up, it's not hard to find them). The book and it's more mechanical idea of \"patterns\" still today forms a foundational part of modern software ideology.\n\nWith this flop, some key figures in software (many from the Hillside Group) sought other ways to make software more humanistic, and as a result we have \"Agile\" (see the \"Agile Manifesto\", also easy to find).\n\nThe Christopher Alexander video marks his address to the software community after this patterns movement had gained traction, and the Gang of Four book had taken its course. He talks a lot about his work, and then addresses the disparagement between it and what software has done with it."
