As a result, there was no substrate on which to grow a tool that would become widespread. However, with the DOM\/CSS and the modern Web APIs (like content editable) we're getting closer to a viable infrastructure for building rich, structured visual editors."

How do you tell whether things are improving?  How do simplification and abstraction differ?  The Jai language is certainly Blow's specific answer in his specific problems.  He notes though that his own thinking that has been trained by his tools (C++ and Game Programming) and therefore will miss what lies outside."
