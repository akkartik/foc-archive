DropBox, AirBnB and many other billion dollar companies got started the same way. They attended YC - much of what they were taught is now covered by this free online version of the course -  <a href="https://www.startupschool.org">https://www.startupschool.org</a>  Next one starts on 20th Jan.  ... It covers many innovation related topics. Topics such as picking ideas, evaluating ideas, creating prototypes. .... Chris Granger (witheve) also attended YC. .... If you are working on a new idea, I can highly recommend it, I learned a lot.

I would also recommend signing up for SUS. I did it on a whim last fall and so happy I didâ€”it's a <b>tiny</b> time commitment and I met some great people. I didn't have a startup but just did it under the name of my FoC research projects. The weekly 1 hour video group sessions with different people each week are fun and a great way to practice pitching your FoC project. If you aren't currently living in a tech hub, it's a great way to meet new people in tech working on interesting things. It's a very positive community where people are more constructive than critical. And it's totally free

I also did YC (for CodeCombat) and can recommend its general philosophy. Also suggest applying to YC itself if you have something resembling a business idea that could form from your project.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Eddy Parkinson</span> Right now we are looking for two game developers in China, six remote salespeople in the US, two curriculum developers (one in SF, one either in San Francisco or remote anywhere), and one event marketer remote in the US. In the future we may do more hiring in China and Australia. I wish we had the budget for some more FoC-interested engineers and will definitely share any open roles along those lines when we open them in #announcements.
