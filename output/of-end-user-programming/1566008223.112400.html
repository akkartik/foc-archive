I agree separating interface from implementation is important, but exposing state does not imply exposing implementation. The state could actually be <em>derived state</em>, automatically maintained based on some hidden original source. In such a scenario, the state acts as an API. Then the only departure from a function-based API is the syntactic means of accessing it. Do you call functions to discover the state, or just query it directly? The difference is probably only important in terms of how it shapes the user's mental model of a system. This was my original point: if a user is inclined to think of something as state, then it should be presented as state. Functions can mean/do a lot more (in particular, take input and mutate things!) so they likely induce additional cognitive burden.
