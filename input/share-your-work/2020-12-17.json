If there are alternative interpretation of the steps, you can pop those open and select one. We don’t let you modify the steps directly, but there’s nothing that prevents it. Though those steps need to be completely unambiguous so you have to type what the system actually knows. e.g. you can’t say “burning” you have to say “on fire” because that’s it’s actual name. You could imagine doing that as more of a spectrum, where you _could_ start typing “burning” and autocomplete would insert “on fire”",
