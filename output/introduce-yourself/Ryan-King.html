Hey Gang! I've been listening to the podcast for a while (I think I cam across it after seeing some of Ivan's Hest gifs on twitter) - anyway love the idea of the 2 minute week and thought I'd stop lurking and start participating.<br/><br/>I have a background in architecture (physical buildings), somehow found myself making project management software for architects. I now find that a bit conventional and am trying to take it to more interesting places (2 minute video soon!)<br/><br/>I've been trying to show my developer and designer friends Bret Victor videos for years, and they never get it - it's good to find others equally interested in the future of programming! (for the longest time I though I was the only one haha) I enjoy programming but also find it kind of terrible. All these things you're all working on are very amazing and I hope to use them to improve my life one - and hopefully I can even participate a little as well!
