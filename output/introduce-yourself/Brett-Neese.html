:wave:  Hey everyone, my name is Brett Neese and I split my time between Puerto Vallarta and Mexico City, Mexico at the moment. I am a software engineer by day and I am studying for a master's degree in cybernetics (which is hard to define but tl;dr I think a lot about <em>systems</em> of all kinds from a philosophical perspective) at DePaul University at night (I built my own degree program).<br/><br/>Currently I'm thinking a lot about <em>emergence</em> in computing (and even writing some of it down!). A friend sent me a link to the latest episode of the podcast which I found particularly relevant to the work I was already doing. It actually started me down a bit of a rabbit hole and now I'm here.<br/><br/>I don't just write theory, either, I'm also a bit of an artist (or trying to be one). I think that art can provide a glimpse into what a different world would look like so I'm trying to tie the two together. You can read some of my writing here <a href="https://queerinterfac.es/tagged/essays">https://queerinterfac.es/tagged/essays</a> and find more about me here: <a href="http://www.brettneese.xyz">http://www.brettneese.xyz</a>
