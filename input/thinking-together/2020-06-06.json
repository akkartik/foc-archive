I think it still had gc and green threads as late as 2012, so at least 6 years to figure out the right combination of features to omit the runtime, becoming recognizably the language that it is today. I wouldn't have paid money for Rust in 2007.\n\nZig is only 5 years old and is surprisingly usable (although I still crash the compiler). I think the timeline for Clojure was similar. But both are much simpler languages, sticking to fairly well understood design spaces. I suspect most foc projects are more like Rust in that they're tackling completely new areas of the design space and will need a lot of shaking out before it's clear whether or not they're going to work out.",

I think it still had gc and green threads as late as 2012, so at least 6 years to figure out the right combination of features to omit the runtime, becoming recognizably the language that it is today. I wouldn't have paid money for Rust in 2007.\n\nZig is only 5 years old and is surprisingly usable (although I still crash the compiler). I think the timeline for Clojure was similar. But both are much simpler languages, sticking to fairly well understood design spaces. I suspect most foc projects are more like Rust in that they're tackling completely new areas of the design space and will need a lot of shaking out before it's clear whether or not they're going to work out."
