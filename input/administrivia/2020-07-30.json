The poster has since deleted the question (see comments in this thread), but here's the text of the question for reference:\n\n&gt; How would you recommend implementing an extensive and large rest api specification? It will include lots of special operations such as negation and logical AND all specified via characters that special meaning. There is no formal grammar, only pages of docs with scattered rules and schemas. Example query: \"\/user?name:not=joe&amp;alex\"\nThis feels like a very \"present of programming\" line of inquiry. It feels like something that'd be posted to Stack Overflow. To me, it doesn't pass the sniff test of on-topic-ness for the community. As the community grows, I think we can expect more things like this, and I'd like us to have a good strategy in place to maintain our focus. There are no shortage of other general programming communities, or technique\/technology-specific communities, that address the present of programming. We're all here because we are unhappy about the present. It's _necessary_ for us to talk about the present, so that we can understand what's wrong with it. But I don't think we should facilitate or normalize conversations that have no eye on the future.\n\n• Do you agree that this example question is too far from the core focus \/ purpose of the community?\n• If so, how should we handle these sorts questions when they come up?",
