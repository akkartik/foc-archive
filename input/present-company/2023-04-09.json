At some point, the stuff gets old or messy. So you write a new, clean version! Make a big mistake? Start over! There's value in rewriting every character on the page and being forced to pay the cost. Is that word worth it? When I write an essay long hand, I often write, make notes on it, then recopy it, make new notes, then recopy. Each recopying gives me new ideas. And each recopying is an opportunity to completely rewrite large sections. I've done this with code as well. It's nice.\n\nIn contrast, editing on a computer, for me, is often an exercise in minimizing the number of changes I have to make to the document to get it where I want it. Can I reword this sentence? How do I word a new sentence to fit exactly here while maintaining the flow of the argument? It's a very different mode of thinking. And we can easily keep thousands of digital files, even for ephemeral notes. Why throw them away?\n\nThese two things lead to a counterintuitive idea: Paper is actually more mutable than digital. With paper, you can crumple it up and toss it. You are constantly recopying (but keeping only the stuff worth keeping). But with digital, we keep old files forever, and even words and sentences in a document that aren't that valuable live longer. Digital has permanence and paper is fleeting.\n\nBut perhaps a more grounded analysis would be: digital makes small changes cheap, paper makes large changes cheap.",
