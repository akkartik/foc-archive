what a great old video. not many videos from this era; back then a camera was super expensive. you can imagine they had a team of 10 people work ing for 4 year, so that's 40 man years worth of work.  Clearly this OOP/Message passing hybrid  was a  dead end. What they should have been testing, is taking people off the street, giving them a few hours of instruction, and seeing how far they got making something in this tool. They are so in love with features of their tool, i think they forgot that hammers are for other people to use for putting in nails. Not to fondle the hammer and marvel at its comfortable grip.
