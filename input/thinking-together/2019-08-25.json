        "text": "Yes that's what I mean. You don't get any choice and the 'definition' implies both - the data model and the memory layout. Even in Haskell where you define only algebraic data types, and implicit layout is provided by the language. In C it seems like the memory layout is more explicit, though you're still defining a data model. Maybe some trickery is possible with C++ templates but it seems really clunky to do it everywhere. What I'm looking for is languages that explicitly support the notion of *data type only* and separately *mapping to bits* - potentially even support multiple representations at the same time in different places. The motivation is our business logic should not be coupled to lower level details, but optimization should still be possible - separate 'design' from 'optimization' in some sense.

Do 'types' declare how bits are laid out in memory or do they declare what the domain meaning is? Without a good solution here, what we have is excessive domain model corruption to appease the machine layout. Starting with C, you had struct packing where you'd suffle fields in a perfectly readable struct just to make it efficient. Then you have the 'array of structs' vs 'structs of arrays' problem. This happens in databases too - the question of how much to normalize. There is absolutely no change to the domain data model across many implementation choices, yet the 'domain logic' code ends up being so tightly coupled to these decisions that switching it requires changing code all over the place. I think what the essay is saying that they want to work more with the domain types than memory layout types. Languages that I know of don't actually separate these two ideas - I wonder if there are any languages that do. E.g. if you define your domain types in a high level type system that is not tied to a specific memory layout. Then separately you define mappings between the domain types and machine types...",

In C it seems like the memory layout is more explicit, though you're still defining a data model. Maybe some trickery is possible with C++ templates but it seems really clunky to do it everywhere. What I'm looking for is languages that explicitly support the notion of "
