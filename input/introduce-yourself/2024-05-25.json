I'm an aspiring poet, blogger, entrepreneur and many other things that are still stretching their legs to hopefully one day make it off the ground.\n\nI learned to code by customizing Myspace layouts for my junior high friends and their (very cool) bands. I failed out of Computer Engineering in college, did a bunch of soul searching, and eventually got my degree in Accounting to save face. I worked as an accountant for *3 whole months* before selling everything I owned and buying a one-way ticket to the Pacific Northwest to hitchhike and couch-surf my way to a more fitting future.\n\n\nMy current career passion is making small processes that help focus a team's energy toward an actual problem that real people care about. This is a hurricane of pain and frustration, but when it works, it's so incredibly satisfying that I can't help but throw myself back in.\n\nI care deeply about people on an individual level. I want to help shape a future that focuses on human-scale problems with human-scale solutions. I believe scale kills good products.\n\nI'm currently developing an app that tells local stories anywhere in the US, with my business partner and very good friend. More importantly, we're building a collection of systems that help us make things and get feedback from real people. My ultimate goal is to use these systems to solve many small problems in unlame ways. I hope to start writing about these systems in the near future.\n\n\nI'm looking forward to exploring this space, and I'd love to have <https:\/\/calendly.com\/jasepellerin\/30min|a 1-1 chat> with any of you about *anything at all*.
