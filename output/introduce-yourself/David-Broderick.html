Hi everyone, I'm David Broderick.  Originally from northern California, I spent 20 years in Europe (mainly Switzerland, Czech Republic and most recently southern France) and I'm currently living in Boise, Idaho.<br/>I used to be part of the 2020 group in San Francisco which has similar discussions and is paired with the Future of Programming meetups in the Bay Area (<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Future-of-Programming">https://www.meetup.com/Future-of-Programming</a>).  My big, long-term project is called Kayia which is an attempt to layer the spreadsheet model onto a declarative language, if that makes any sense.  I would link to the site for that, but since it's undergoing a lot of changes, it just has a stub for now.   I'm looking forward to joining in on the discussions!
