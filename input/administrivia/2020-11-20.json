I guess that those kind of FoC community shared cloud resources could be useful for some project.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: there are often free tiers for cloud services which could be enough for some projects (like mine, see below). So maybe we can focus on things not already covered by this kind of offers? Like the need of virtual machines. And maybe the added value will be on the collaborative\/sharing features?\n\nTo illustrate the kind of needs, here is what I have done for adacraft, which is not founded and for which I was looking for free\/cheap cloud ressources to make it works.\n\nI choose to do as much as I can into serverless because 1\/ I like it, and 2\/ it will mean less work\/stress for me for the infra stuff.\n\nSo, it is mainly static web (for the web portal and the modified Scratch editor), a DB (for projects and users info) and file storage (image, sounds, raw project files).\n\nHere are the cloud resources\/services I use. Netlify for the static web files, for some few lambdas and for user authentication. FaunaDB as a servereless database. S3 compatible object storage hosted by OVH for the file storage. All this are paid services with free tiers that are very comfortable for a small project like mine.\n\nI also use <http:\/\/GitLab.com|GitLab.com> as a code repository (also free).\n\nThe only thing I am paying now is analytics from Netlify. Which cost 9$ a month. I use it because at that time it was the easiest and quickest way to have analytics. Since then, I thought it would be cool and fun to reimplement a very basic analytics system based on FaunaDB, but I haven't took the time for that yet.\n\nSo for example, one need for me for a common cloud ressource would be a web analytics solution (Matomo or something else).\n\nOne thing I want to play with in the future, is some kind of server side execution of some users code. At that time maybe I will need some VM or some more advanced lambda (if the Netlify ones are not enough).",
