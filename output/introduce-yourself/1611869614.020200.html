Hello! Most of my career has seen me working in a visual programming language, namely LabVIEW. Because of this experience, when I move to my other favorite languages like F# or Racket, it feels like 2 steps forward and 3 steps backwards, primarily when it comes to being able to debugging and especially while the program is running. I am inspired by visual languages like vvvv, Pure Data, and TouchDesigner, and I am convinced that the future of programming is a hybrid approach, where there is tight integration but blurred lines between what is textually and visually specified. I am learning Pure Data and vvvv at the moment, and still have it on my plate to learn Touch Designer and Pharo, all the while I am working on designing my own language while also learning how to generally do so. :) The trouble is I'm not the smartest tool in the shed, so progress is slow but becoming tangible.

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@bmitc</span>, and welcome here!<br/><br/>I also like the idea about blurring the line between what is textually and visually specified! I like the idea of having an environment where you can mix the two. In fact, I feel this needs when I used Max/MSP long time ago and feel frustrated by nodes/wires programming for some tasks and switching to JavaScript (you can do that with Max/MSP, not easily but you can) was a relief.<br/><br/>I am curious about what you are working on. Do you have any pointers to your work? If you feel so, you can show some of your progress in #share-your-work channel!

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@nicolas decoster</span>! Thanks for the welcome!<br/><br/>Regarding the blurring, I'd say I haven't quite got it figured out myself but feel it's the right thing. I do feel the primary challenge is in deciding what is specified via textual-based input and what is specified via visual-based input and deciding how one transitions from one to the other and back, if at all. One technical challenge in that is visual layout, for either text or visual nodes, and I think that in any case, <em>automatic</em> layout is paramount. Even in text-based languages, I enjoy Lisps and Schemes because the structure yields easy automatic layout and formatting. However, the problem is not easy.<br/><br/>So I have a lot of work to do and mainly a lot of learning. I'm trying to learn more programming language design and implementation and I need to dive into graph data structures and algorithms (I do not have a computer science background).<br/><br/>Another thing I am doing is just building prototypes, and a major challenge in that was choosing a cross-platform GUI language. I really wanted to use F#, but landed on using Racket and its GUI toolkit. I've thought about the distraction of building my on GUI toolkit in F# using Skia because even now I still feel there's no good solution, in any language, for clean and simple development of desktop apps. F# is just so easy to build software that is understandable and works, but Racket's language making capability may come in handy.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm mainly working on prototypes in Racket. My goal is to build a visual language for 2D graphics and animation, similar to Pure Data, vvvv, TouchDesigner, and Processing. I plan to use it to learn the GUI framework and experiment with ideas while constraining the end goal to 2D graphics. After that, I hopefully will have learned enough and will have libraries built up to start working on more general programming environments.

Not much, but looks promising!<br/><br/>Does the blocks for circle display the actual circle instance with its properties applied (at least for stroke and fill)?<br/><br/>I like the idea of having an block for the renderer!

Thanks!  I just started a couple weeks ago, although I've had these ideas forever. Wish the GUI toolkit was documented better in Racket, but it is powerful.<br/><br/>&gt;  Does the blocks for circle display the actual circle instance with its properties applied (at least for stroke and fill)?<br/>Yes! That's the idea or hope at least. I think this will end up being a bit of a cross between TouchDesigner and vvvv where I'd like there to be as much information as possible available to display to the user. So even animations should show up. Right now, I'm concentrating on a few nodes mainly to learn the GUI toolkit enough to move towards an "end-to-end" prototype.

Hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Garth Goldwater</span>. Thanks for the references! I've been meaning to go through the Pharo MOOC for sometime, and I am at least aware of Squeak. Is it different enough to warrant studying both it and Pharo (or it over Pharo)? I have a book that walks you through building a Smalltalk (<em>A Little Smalltalk</em>) that I also need to go through.<br/><br/>Also, I actually saw Andrew's talk at RacketCon 2019 in person. Haha. It was a great talk. Although, if I remember correctly, he used Racket's BigBang library, which is an abstraction on top of the drawing toolkit in Racket, rather than the GUI and drawing toolkits themselves. I'm a bit married to using the GUI toolkit because of its <tt>pasteboard%</tt> functionality. But you're right, I should spelunk the code. Thanks for the reminder of that project!

Tru facts. I started fructure in GUI but backed off for a few reasons, most notably that I wanted to go more immediate-mode rather than the retained-mode GUI mandates. Mixed feelings about the decision in retrospect. Embedded editors snippets are amazing

Thanks for the history <span style="background-color:#ccf">@andrew blinn</span>. Embedded editors are in fact cool, but I'm finding them tough (they are what draw the nodes in the above prototype picture). I get the feeling they were designed more from the perspective of containing a <tt>text%</tt> editor rather than a <tt>pasteboard%</tt>, the latter of which is my primary use case.
