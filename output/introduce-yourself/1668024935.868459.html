Hi I'm Derek (aka nilix); I discovered the FoC podcast a few days ago and thought I might feel right at home in this community!<br/>I'm interested in permacomputing, UI/UX (and of course DevI/DevX) and how we can make them better, and computers as art and tools both for art and for 'practical' things. My website is <a href="https://nilfm.cc">https://nilfm.cc</a><br/><br/>My recent projects include a modular CMS (modular in that it can accept multiple adapters around the headless SSG doing the page generation, although right now only one adapter is implemented - <a href="https://nilfm.cc/nirvash.html)">https://nilfm.cc/nirvash.html)</a>, a simple slippy map annotation tool (<a href="https://nilfm.cc/onyx.html">https://nilfm.cc/onyx.html</a>), and I'm currently working on a lightweight virtual tabletop for remote D&amp;D. I'm also into the uxn ecosystem, having developed the xrxs experimental uxn game server (<a href="https://nilfm.cc/xrxs.html">https://nilfm.cc/xrxs.html</a>) and worked on a couple other uxn-adjacent projects. I've got a xrxs-capable game in the very early stages but I keep getting too distracted by other projects to make much progress :p<br/><br/>As far as my DevX goes, my general setup is voidlinux with plan9port on top of it, with heavily customized acme and rio forks (<a href="https://nilfm.cc/acme9k.html">https://nilfm.cc/acme9k.html</a>, <a href="https://nilfm.cc/ryudo.html">https://nilfm.cc/ryudo.html</a>). I love shell scripting and making simple (sometimes maybe not so much?) solutions to esoteric problems :)<br/><br/>Glad to be a part of this community, and I expect I may see some familiar faces from the uxn and merveilles crowds :&gt;
