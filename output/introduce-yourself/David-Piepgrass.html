I’ve been dreaming of making some sort of “ultimate programming language” for over 15 years—but to my surprise, never found any like-minded folks until recently. I registered <a href="http://loyc.net/">http://loyc.net/</a> in 2007 with the idea of making a democratically-extensible compiler with multiple input syntaxes; as time passed it morphed into a set of general ideas for language building. More concretely I wrote the C# parser generator LLLPG and the Lisp-inspired macro system it runs within (it's designed so that the same macro system could support any programming language, I just haven't had time to go beyond C#). But for this group the most relevant thing I've made is LESv2 and LESv3, two simple languages to represent universal syntax trees. I've worked a bit with Jonathan Van der Cruise who made Flame, a compiler-building framework for C#. I learned about Haxe just this year, but I've wanted to build something for several years that would let you write libraries targeting several languages at once. I think I could build something better than Haxe and Cito (Ć) - if only I had some funding and manpower. I’d also be interested in a system for bridging programming languages at run-time so they could communicate seamlessly. For now, I’m too busy at my new job to do anything, including hang out here! (truth be told it's a horrible job and I desperately wish to find something better.) I’ve been bursting with ideas for years and hate being unable to execute on them.<br/><br/>Links:<br/>• Loyc trees <a href="http://loyc.net/loyc-trees">http://loyc.net/loyc-trees</a><br/>• LES <a href="http://loyc.net/les">http://loyc.net/les</a> &lt;= Use this to prototype new programming languages<br/>• LLLPG <a href="http://ecsharp.net/lllpg">http://ecsharp.net/lllpg</a><br/>• LeMP <a href="http://ecsharp.net/lemp">http://ecsharp.net/lemp</a><br/>• Flame <a href="https://github.com/jonathanvdc/Flame">https://github.com/jonathanvdc/Flame</a><br/>• Haxe <a href="https://haxe.org">https://haxe.org</a>

I want to work on the foundations of programming and on interoperability, and I think my work is relevant to everyone here. Many researchers, for instance, have made experimental programming languages and environments - but they can't interoperate with each other! Many languages can only interoperate with C, one of the most archaic languages in existence!<br/><br/>We must break down these silo walls, so I want to work on those common foundations: to figure out a way to let you write a library in a language that will convert itself to several different languages and run easily on many platforms. To figure out how to standardize everything from point data types (X,Y coordinates), to D-style ranges (an abstraction for subsequences), to whatever data types neural networks are made of, to the way debuggers work. (current thinking: a StackOverflow-like site where people vote on interface designs?). In short, I want to solve the technical problems that create friction in both the niche of programming language design and in the broader world of software engineering. (But, as I say, no time, can't do it. It's funny to have enough urgent work to fill a lifetime, but treat it like a minor hobby to do on weekends sometimes.)<br/><br/>Oh and Bret Victor inspired me yada yada I invent on principle blah blah. Like the rest of y'all :slightly_smiling_face: But seriously, Bret Victor FTW.<br/><br/>Twitter: @DPiepgrass  Site: <a href="http://david.loyc.net">david.loyc.net</a>
