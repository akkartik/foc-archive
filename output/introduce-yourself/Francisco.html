Hello! :man-bowing: I'm Francisco. I'm based in the Bay Area (live in Berkeley, work anywhere in SF); by way of ~Lisbon~, ~Berlin~, and ~Los Angeles~.<br/><br/>I'm a designer. I work at the intersection of communication, product, and prototyping with code (cough cough... and lots of Webflow). I'm here because I have a bit of a masochistic, pseudo-philosophical, love for computers and code. A fascination for understanding what computers are, what we could do with them, and how to communicate their magic to a non-technical audience. Think me explaining what a great tool-for-thought a function is to my grandmother at Christmas.<br/><br/>In terms of projects I'm currently going through a bit of a reset; reading a lot, taking inventory. But ultimately, with the goal to define an area of research through which to grow my skills. I'm here by way of <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mary Rose Cook</span> 's notion page. She absolutely does not know me but I recently stumbled upon her notion and am currently reading it like a fanboy reading LOTR.<br/><br/>Lastly, here's two posts I wrote a while back to explain some basic programming ideas to my ... gramma? :P<br/><a href="http://francsco.com/post/unpacking-the-computer">francsco.com/post/unpacking-the-computer</a><br/><a href="http://francsco.com/post/three-core-ideas-in-a-programming-language">francsco.com/post/three-core-ideas-in-a-programming-language</a><br/><br/>Excited to poke around and see what everyone is up to!<br/>Francisco<br/><br/>PS: :headphones: Obsessed with Nils Frahm, Hania Rani, the Grandbrothers, and anything neo-classic-meets-electronic.
