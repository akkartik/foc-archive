you app has a cannonical representation for a square, are you sure that all the layers up until the pixels are drawn on the screen share your repesentation? even if some share the representation, you can't pass a pointer to the data, because it crosses many boundaries and even if it did, the other layers don't know about the layout of your representation, that means that the quest to find the true canonical representation of a square to avoid 2 additions/substractions will end up being transformed and copied N times until it ends on the screen
