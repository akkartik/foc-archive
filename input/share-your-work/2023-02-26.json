But I'm much, much more interested in what folks like Brooks mean when they say \"programming isn't inherently spatial\", which I take to mean: programming is largely about symbol manipulation and the shuffling of bits facilitated by a _language_, and language isn't spatial in the sense that _the world around us_ is spatial, so programming isn't spatial.

        "text": "<@UC2A2ARPT> I wonder if we could approach this topic from a slightly different framing? Mainly, let’s say that a program is a set of topological relationships that allow the computer to perform computations. Some examples of these relationships include containment, order, adjacency, and connection. It shouldn’t matter what level of abstraction (bytecode, assembly, ect.) we are thinking about the program at, these relationships are encoded in some way. The insight of this framing is that these relationships can be expressed in different modalities. Computer hardware cares about these relationships expressed as bytes, compilers cares about these relationships symbolically, and humans care about these relationships in a multimodal manner (symbolically, geometrically, spatially, ect.). \n\nFor example, containment is typically defined as anything inside of a pair of brackets or parenthesis (e.g. function body, class body, ect.). The whitespace inside of those brackets is meaningless to a compiler, but meaningful to the people authoring that program as demonstrated by the commonplace cultural practices around code style guides and linters. Whitespace sensitive compilers are interesting because I would argue that those compilers dont care about the spatial modality, its that the symbolic\/textual relationships maps to a meaningful spatial\/geometric modality humans favor.\n\nIm not a fan of these “inherently spatial or not spatial” reductions. To me thr “future of coding” is about taking these topological relationships a program describes and enabling them it be viewed and interacted with in many different (and new) modalities that best enable the person and machine to understand and act on that program!\n\nTangentially, programming paradigms what those topological relationships are, what they mean to the human and machine, and what guarantees can be made about them.\n\nAnyway see “On Visual Formalisms” by Harel for more on the topic! <https:\/\/dl.acm.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1145\/42411.42414|https:\/\/dl.acm.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1145\/42411.42414>",
