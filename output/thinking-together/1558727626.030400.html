Re: <span style="background-color:#ccf">@seanbax</span><br/>&gt; I think mind-bending is a non-goal.<br/><br/>I think mind-bending is a fantastic <em>consequence</em> of many worthwhile goals.<br/><br/>When I see something that initially strikes me as mind-bending, I take that as a good sign that I can learn a lot from it. And as a community focussed on exploring future possibilities, learning about work at the frontiers is a big part of what we do here. So feel free to lean away from that if it doesn't motivate you, just be aware that it's something championed and valued here.
