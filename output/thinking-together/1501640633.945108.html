also for format we were talking about starting w/ quick intros and what you're working on followed by breaking into smaller groups unconference style (steve feel free to clarify if i'm not presenting that clearly) or possibly have more in depth presentations on new programming environments/systems if anyone wants to volunteer. <br/><br/>i like the idea of the small group discussions, but open to any ideas (especially if anyone wants to present their own work)
