Today I am looking at how to direct a reactive Dataflow stream to one-of-n downstream cells. This article assumes you are familiar with Observable's non-linear reactive program flow already. Sometimes we want control the dataflow with logic. If we have a cell called data streaming values, we might like to direct those updates to either cell_1 or cell_2. You can programatically trigger dataflow by calling dispatchEven",
