Over the last 15 years, sales of my labeling software to China exactly equal the sales to the tiny country of New Caledonia. I defy you to locate New Caledonia on a world map. Honesty is not evenly distributed. That is a per capita sales ratio of around 5000:1. So i think that China could stand some improvement in terms of their attitude towards paying for intellectual property."
