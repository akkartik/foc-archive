They give you final design but not interstitials and states or the temporality that connects these things, or they might give you actionability, even predicate based sequences, but no crafting of complex branching logic, for example.\n\nDisclosure: I'm a node-wire live-prog buff. I thought Yahoo Pipes was the cats whiskers way back when. And today I know we can do even better (I'm working on it!)"
