Saw the catalogue post on HN and found it super interesting :slightly_smiling_face: I'm one of the cofounders of <https:\/\/withkoji.com> , a web-based IDE + hosting platform trying to make it easier for non-devs and junior devs to create games and web apps (JS or JS-flavored things) by remixing existing apps and then using a combination of code and no-code interfaces to create something new. We're fresh out of beta, and already have a ton of different people from all around the world and all walks of life creating all kinds of weird things -- the goal is to do to app development what YouTube did to video publishing. Some more info here: <https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2019\/04\/23\/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform\/> and here: <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BgpFGMH6VR4> (long technical video).

Just handling recertification for free using the certs that you renew every 30 days saves people a lot of money (several hundred dollars for code signing certs from most companies, because there is a monopoly now with all the acquisitions of certificate issuing authorities). Trying to develop inside a browser with the inability to write the local hard drive makes software development almost impossible, so their connection to a server spun up from a pool is very clever.  I made a lot of iphone apps, and waiting 2 weeks for approval, not to mention the $99\/year is an impediment of sorts."
