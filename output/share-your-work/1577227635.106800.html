I agree with all of it I think .. although I'm not sure about this one:<br/><br/>&gt; <b>Less, but better &gt; complete</b><br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; A small tool that works well for a single domain is more valuable than a generic tool that tries to be everything to everyone. A working solution that delivers value to a small group of people is valuable, even if it is not as expressive as a general programming language.

Why not try to be general at first, and see how it goes? Shame to add this restriction from the start!

Yeah, I see that having two parallel “blog chains” is confusing, especially if the blog doesn’t really do a good job in presenting them differently. There’s so much I hate about the static website generators I’ve tried, but I felt I needed to get started with publishing and fix all that template stuff later. <br/><br/>So there’s “Universal Structure”, which is about what I learned from cognitive science and I believe is valuable for programming and there’s “Beyond Code”, which is more solution-oriented and my take on what I’d like to build (without necessarily having that figured out fully yet).<br/><br/>I really want to have categories for each series and index pages to make that all easier to navigate but that means I have to find another theme or fix the one I’m using right now, and that’s just distracting me from writing.

For me it was relatively clear they were two blog chains. But maybe it is because after reading your first serie I wanted to read your other contributions and quickly found the first issue of the "Beyond Code" chain.

By the way, this new article is very nice. Once again, I feel very very close to the vision your share with this article. I totally agree with most of your principles and I am in this exactly mindset when thinking about and tinkering with Future of Programming. And I like your words and sense of synthesis. So thanks, that was a perfect christmas present! :slightly_smiling_face:

<b>Native &gt; Web</b> My main point of disagreement is on this one. For me the web is the plate-form to use because of its very special nature. It is based on standards that are everywhere and are here to stay independently of any other considerations. Of course they have drawbacks and add some layers of abstraction that can be seen as non necessary, but their advantages are more important for me. I have already developped this point some time ago on this Slack, for me anything to do now about Future of Programming has to be build on top of the web plate-form.

<b>Mobile &gt; Desktop</b> Why not? But my guess is that it is very complicated to do it right. And this raises the bar very high for some of the other objectives that are more important to me. In other words: I will forget this one if it is in balance with some other objectives.

And there is another very important principle for me (trying to use your style :wink: ): <b>Collaborative first &gt; individual oriented</b>. Prefer tools that allow several people to exchange, collaborate and interact with the system together from the same place or from different places. Focus on individuals only when it add value (i.e. when you need to identify people).

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@nicolas decoster</span> Thanks for your kind feedback and the tweet! You bring up some excellent points:<br/><br/>In short, I think the whole last section about technology choices is mostly just stating my personal preferences which have more to do with my past experience than anything else. I consider them a lot less important (that’s why they go last) and I don’t think they have much impact on inventing a future of programming in general. They mostly have an impact on my own work, because if I chose technologies I don’t like or don’t know well enough, I’m just not setting myself up for success.<br/><br/>In other words, if your background and your heart is in web technologies, than you should absolutely pick that as the foundation for your projects.<br/><br/>The mobile over desktop thing I feel strongly about because I’d like to “skate to where the puck will be”, and I just don’t believe that everyday computing will happen much longer on a classic mouse + keyboard interface. It’ll still be around for decades mostly for us who have issues with leaving text editors and terminal emulations behind, and I don’t really have a problem with that. I don’t even think touchscreens are where it’s at and we’ll be soon entering the AR age, whatever that means. Most (non-programming) people have most of their computational needs being met on a smartphone today, and if I want to reach those people, I need to start where they are. I could be wrong, of course. But I’d like to take that bet.<br/><br/>On collaboration I have much more to say. But not now. And I will likely do that in a future blog post. I can tell you that there was a paragraph “collaboration” in all drafts and edits until I published it.

I totally agree with you about mobile share over desktop. And you are right, to reach those peolpe targetting their device is important. It is just that it seems to me so limitating to design/interact with complex systems in such a tiny thing like a phone... I agree 100% with you about the idea that traditionnal mouse/keyboard will be less important and that we must be open now to any kind of device or interactions, including AR. What we know now is that we don't know how people will interact with dynamic media/systems in the future.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span> Ok, so my approach is kind of the opposite to “general first and see how it goes”, because I think starting with a goal of building something generic (as in Turing-complete) puts you directly into programming language land. Nothing wrong with that! But everybody is doing that already.<br/><br/>I like to look at large, creative applications for music production, video editing, or visual design as examples for creative tools that enable people to create quite a large variety of creative content. These tools might have grown surprisingly or accidentally or even intentionally turing-complete over time (see &lt;<a href="https://www.gwern.net/Turing-complete">https://www.gwern.net/Turing-complete</a>&gt; for context), but they started out with a focus of how to manipulate domain-specific data structures visually. That’s what I find interesting and promising. I’m not opposed to ending up with something generic and powerful and Turing-complete, but I’d like to get there organically and not mandate it from the start.<br/><br/>I also feel like setting it as a goal from the beginning frames the whole problem as “just” inventing another (visual?) programming language — and I find that limiting.<br/><br/>When you ask about DSL, did it even occur to you that I might not even look for a language? Most of us here would probably expect something language-like to come out of that process. But I don’t know really, what I’m looking for yet. I’m more looking into data structures and what the essence of structure is and how much more those domain-specific data structures mentioned above can be generalized.<br/><br/>I know that this sounds weird, and frankly probably not very promising, perhaps esoteric. Hence my attempts to explain where I’m coming from in these blog posts. I hope I can get everyone who’s interested enough to a place where they no longer think it’s weird, and then we can start discussing how promising it is.

OK, well then it's a surprisingly aligned list of preferences for those that, like myself, are in fact building general purpose (visual) programming systems (languages/architectures)!<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the trouble to rebuild your response - was it easy enough (with some Christmas Spirit inside you!) and did it turn out better than the original? :smile:

Actually, I have written in my own notes that the vast bulk of value in my approach will come from: enabling people to build data structures, link them up, and use or configure pre-set behaviours and write simple (non-TC) transformations..

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span> Fully agree — I said it before here somewhere that most if not all computation is just transforming data. If we can figure out easier ways to let non-programmers transform their own data, or better yet let the computer do transformations for them automatically where necessary, I think we will have solved a big part of the future of programming puzzle.

I'm late to this post (coming via the newsletter) — sorry!<br/><br/>One kind of fun reading it is in looking at each of these principles and deciding where in the divide my own work falls.<br/><br/>&gt; Tools for everyone &gt; better tools for experts<br/>In this case, my first reaction was to assert to myself, "I'm 100% working on tools for experts!" But upon reflection, I realized that I'm actually trying to do both.<br/><br/>I'm working on tools for everyone, that allow for the gradual development of deep expertise in those tools. Tools for new experts.<br/><br/>This is an interesting framing device, especially in light of the recent discussion about <a href="https://ralphammer.com/make-me-think/">https://ralphammer.com/make-me-think/</a>. When people say "programming tools for everyone", I think there's usually a tacit assumption that these tools will reduce incidental complexity as much as possible, sure, but then hide whatever complexity remains but the designer feels hinders approachability. I wonder if that's just my assumption, though, informed by existing examples of accessible but sharply curtailed "everyone can do it" programming tools — Shortcuts, for instance.<br/><br/>What do you (person reading this) think of when you read the phrase "tools for everyone"? Do you imagine people becoming dizzyingly virtuosic with those tools, or do you mostly imagine children and non-tech adults taking their first steps into computation and playing with data in new but relatively simple ways?

When I read "tools for everyone", I think about the opposite of "tools only usable by experts". I don't mean that everybody should use the tools, but everyone that wants/needs to, can use them. And I neither mean that experts must not use these tools.<br/><br/>Maybe a good example is Max/MSP. Some musicians with no programming skills can use it and begin to program, experts can also find it usefull, especially for the audio processing part of the tool. As an "expert" programmer, I prefer setting audio flows with MaxMSP than JavaScript/WebAudio (or even Faust, which is  a text language designed for audio processing). I just find that for programmers it is sometime frustrating and more complicated than text language. That's why I believe in mixed tools: both visual and text languages.
