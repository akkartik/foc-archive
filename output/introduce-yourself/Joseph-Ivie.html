Hello! I wish I would have found this forever ago - I'm a software engineer that's extremely interested in programming language design, and I'm currently working on a language concept (deterministic, metaprogramming, and code-completable editing). <br/><br/>I got interested in programming languages while working extensively on various libraries for mobile/back-end/web (Kotlin), as I frequently found myself fighting language limitations to make the most intuitive and simple API possible. I've made a simple scripting language in the past, and I've managed my way around ANTLR while making a Kotlin to Swift syntax translator. <br/><br/>I've sure been humbled just reading about the various concepts I've never considered before, especially coding with proofs.  I also feel a little out of my depth with some of the formal terms here, but I'm excited to learn from you all!
