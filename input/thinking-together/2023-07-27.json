With tonnes of innovative features which had never been implemented before and which seemed obvious and common-sense after the fact.\n\nThis work sounds a lot like what we are working on in the software, hardware and otherwise industrial realms.\n\nIf you are in Paris or are able to get to Paris, entry is 17 euros.\n\nI'll be going on the 7th of August if anyone is around for drinks, lunch and\/or a chat :slightly_smiling_face:",
