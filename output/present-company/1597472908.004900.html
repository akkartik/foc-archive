<b>Welcome to #present-company!</b><br/><br/>This is a brand-new channel. It's our home for discussions about the present world — how we do programming today, how the world as it exists influences us, and generally any thoughts or questions about the here and now.<br/><br/>If you'd like help with your homework, this is the place to ask. If you wrote a new blog post about how to use <tt>react-thingamabob</tt>, this is the place to share it.<br/><br/>• Reflections on how the current world might influence the future go in #thinking-together — really, any thoughts about the future go there, even if they draw on the present or history.

Wait what does "company" mean in the channel name? When I hear "present company" I think Santa's workshop...

Hah, nice. We might be able to make something of that during the holiday season :p<br/><br/><em>Present company</em> is part of a <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/324569/does-the-phrase-present-company-excepted-exclude-the-speaker-as-well-as-the-li">figure of speech</a>. Here's an example of how it's usually used: Let's say this is some high fantasy setting, and we're in a party together. I'm an elf, and you're a human. You might say outwardly "I've never met an elf I could respect," then looking at me, "present company excepted."<br/><br/>It's "company" in the sense of <em>the people around you —</em> both in the future of speech and as used for this channel. The word "present", then, has a double meaning for us — it's meant to mean both "here" as in we are all in this place, and "now" as in this is the channel where we talk about matters of the present day.<br/><br/>This is the channel where we all discuss matters of the here and now, drawing on the expertise and breadth of experience that this community has brought together.<br/><br/>Our other name ideas for this channel were all too narrow in their scope – eg: #present-of-programming didn't leave the door open to discussions of slightly more off-topic things, which is something I want this channel to be available for. I also wanted to put the focus on the fact that the people in this community are all alive in the present and there's a value to us all being together.

I see. Your rationale makes sense, but the name doesn't invoke those connotations for me!

Good name for the channel.  I'll be sure to post my yearly floating point rant here.  :wink:

Just realized my explanation included a real nonsense typo:<br/>&gt; It's "company" in the sense of <em>the people around you —</em> both in the future of speech and as used for this channel.<br/>It's "company" in the sense of <em>the people around you —</em> both in the <em><b>figure</b></em> of speech and as used for this channel.
