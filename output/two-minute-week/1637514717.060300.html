:wave: Hi, all! This is my first post on Alpha here, so I want to establish a little bit of context. (The next posts will be shorter.)<br/><br/>Alpha—a programming language for extensible systems (and hopefully malleable ones in the future). I imagine it as something in between of Julia, Emacs Lisp, and Smalltalk.<br/><br/>I’ve been working on it for a month now, so it’s still an infant. It has REPL, user-defined types, multi-methods, and a print function, but not much else :grin:<br/><br/>So far it serves two purposes:<br/>• it is a playground for me to experiment with PLT ideas (multi-methods, JIT, gradual typing, etc)<br/>• it allows me to gain actual experience implementing languages (my problem is that I have too much knowledge and too little practice)<br/>This week I was adding a garbage collector. It was tougher than I expected, but I got it working with the host language. The compiler still needs to be modified to produce the compatible code, so that’s the focus of the next week.<br/><br/>Here is a larger update for this week with memory layout images and some tips on debugging GC:<br/><a href="https://www.alexeyshmalko.com/alpha-3/">https://www.alexeyshmalko.com/alpha-3/</a>
