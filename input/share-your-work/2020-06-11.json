It is a platform for quickly assembling web apps out of a new kind of software module we call a concept. Concepts are full-stack units of end-user functionality. For example, a comment concept manages the creation and display of comments, and a posting concept lets users create posts.\n\nEach concept exports a set of components, which are similar to components in modern web frameworks like React. A key difference, however, is that concept components have an associated server-side action, which can be synchronized with other actions. In our platform, called Déjà Vu, a developer builds an app by including concepts and synchronizing the server-side actions of components. To assemble apps you only write JSON, HTML, and CSS—no server-side code or client-side JavaScript is required.\n\nWebpage: <https:\/\/deja-vu-platform.com>\nPaper: <https:\/\/spderosso.github.io\/onward19.pdf>\nSlides of the most recent talk: <https:\/\/spderosso.github.io\/slides\/thesisdefense20.pdf>\nDemo of the graphical environment (developed by Barry, a master student in our group): <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=10IexBI5v-A&amp;feature=youtu.be>\n\nIf you have any feedback, let me know.

If there are no data structures, then how would you do a tic tac toe game for example, where you track the mutable state of the game as it progresses?  Or do you intend the game to be a custom module. JSON is a highly limiting data storage format, it only has boolean, string, and numeric data, and meta data is quite awkward to embed.\n\nI did like that you had students build little test apps."
