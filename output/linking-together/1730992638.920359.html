Thanks for writing this.<br/><br/>I think of myself as an "off-brand gentleman researcher" [A] who has also tried building products and businesses in the past. So I may not have anything in common with "real" researchers. On the other hand, "it doesn't feel like research" is a problem I wrestle with everyday.<br/><br/>The way I think about it lately is, we're all (researchers, artists, founders) people surrounded by an environment of great beauty. But the beauty is kinda stark. Not that different from the environment we evolved for, achingly beautiful landscapes indifferent to our survival. Our advantage today: survival is seldom at issue. Our disadvantage: there's also a lot less reason to band together, first by survival becoming a given over the last 10,000 years, and then by the great expansion of the state space of beautiful things we could go look at. Computers have given us new ways to find and appreciate beauty that we didn't have before. The key bottleneck now seems to be to get some number of people to care about the beauty we're looking at. It seems more meaningful somehow if we share beauty and appreciation deeply with others.<br/><br/>Art, research and business seem like heuristics to improve the odds that others will engage with what we're engaging with:<br/>• Art: it's beautiful and it's right here! Just try experiencing it!<br/>• Research: it'll be useful to you, and give you (researcher) more tools to go exploring yourself.<br/>• Business: it'll be useful to you, and you (investor, employee, conference attendee where I'm on the panel) should care about it because I've got a lot of money / am going to have a lot of money, and maybe you can get a lot too. (Yes, sounds crass. But am I being overly uncharitable? Is there more reason here that I am forgetting?)<br/>Anyways, I'm not sure what I'm saying. I guess I'm wondering if "research" is a well-posed category beyond a trade network for getting funded and earning a living. The boundaries between the above heuristics seem porous, and I think there may be space to discover new heuristics.<br/><br/>Thanks for a thought-provoking post!<br/><br/>[A] Some recent "papers" I've written: <a href="https://akkartik.name/post/2024-04-24-devlog">1</a> <a href="https://akkartik.name/post/2024-08-30-devlog">2</a> <a href="https://akkartik.name/post/2024-07-10-devlog">3</a> <a href="https://akkartik.name/post/programming-2024">4</a>

&gt;  The boundaries between the above heuristics seem porous, and I think there may be space to discover new heuristics<br/>Absolutely. I share your ambivalence the labels on some of the work I do. Is it research? Art? Inquiry? etc.<br/><br/>To me there <em>is</em> something rewarding about doing stuff that is "novel" in some way, whether that is published at a conference/journal or just a blog post. Realistically most of the work is <em>not</em> like that. But it is something I'm interested in and would like to do more of in the future.
