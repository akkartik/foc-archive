Hi! I've been told about this community as a place where one can present some early stage ideas to like-minded people aware of the drastic changes that the landscape of programming systems is undergoing.<br/><br/>During my graduate studies I did research in the fields of both theoretical Constraint Programming and End User Development, although now I only do it as a personal side project.  I devoured the now classics "Watch what I do" and "Your wish is my command", as well as all the UX books I could find and anything design-related in a wide sense. I'm a believer that the Cognive Dimensions framework of TRG Green et. al. has potential for its intended use as a meta-language for exploring software design and pivoting it in unusual directions, though that may be over-confidence on my understanding of it. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>I certainly have ideas that I would like to develop into a coherent explanation, on how to create a system for information workers who want to build their own data processing workflows without constant assistance from software engineers. I've seen the venerable copy/paste being used for gluing disparate tools into personal workflows through lots of back-and-forth manual data transfers; I've even seen this copy/paste protocol upgraded from humble raw text to rich text, supporting style and multimedia objects. And I have insights for a new upgrade that provides the protocol with structured data and persistent semi-automated workflows, building the mythical "unix pipes for visual user interfaces" that we were promised decades ago.<br/><br/>I have seen many signs that the computing field is converging towards a form of computation with novel aspects reappearing in different contexts, where many of my ideas about modern computation appear incomplete in various systems, with no single one containing all of them. I would love to explore what expectations people have about modern knowledge-processing devices, and whether my insights could be used to support those expectations and improve their users work. I hope this community will help me grow in knoledge.
