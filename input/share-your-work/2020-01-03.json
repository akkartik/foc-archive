My main website is at <https:\/\/mmm.s-ol.nu|https:\/\/mmm.s-ol.nu>, and a bit more stable. <http:\/\/ba.s-ol.nu|ba.s-ol.nu> is going to stay up at least until my thesis evaluation is over, just to be sure, but then it will probably go away, with the changes merged into master and the permalink updated accordingly.",
