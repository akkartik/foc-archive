But that'd be like a BFA saying all the Lisp compilers or quines or rendering engines or constraint systems we programmers whip up are \"products that never went anywhere\".\n\nAs a visual \/ interaction designer, the offering that this person is making to the world is — \"Here's an idea I had, and here's how I would realize the parts of that idea that I have the skills to create.\" You could hand that same idea to a programmer, and they could make a usable prototype, but in the absence of help from a visual \/ interaction designer it'd almost certainly look so bad that it'd be hard to use. And in the absence of someone skilled at sales or marketing, it'd probably never take root in the world at large.\n\nSo don't dismay that this is _yet another mockup_. Learn what you can from this, so that when it comes time for you to make your demo, it might be benefitted by you having studied good visual \/ interaction design.",
