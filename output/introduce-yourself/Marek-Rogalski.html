Hello all computing futurists! I'm a fellow future of coding enthusiast. I believe that with some effort computing could be made more ergonomic, more egalitarian and more efficient. I've tried and failed to start my own visual programming startup, done a PhD in language modelling (in the pre-transformer era) and worked on cybersecurity at Google for 8 years. Now I'm back to visual programming. This time as a hobby project :)<br/><br/>I have a tiny YouTube channel where I live-stream my work: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcTosjkFZZY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcTosjkFZZY</a>.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to exchanging feedback and ideas with other like-minded people. I particularly like in-person meetings, quiet natural environments and morning hours (anyone up for a dog walk in the Łódź area?) but I'm also fine with commuting to an evening pub meeting in Berlin or London if that's where other FoC enthusiasts hang out.
