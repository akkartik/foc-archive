That's a good way to create a personal knowledge base and that's what most people did. I looked around at that time, but there were little alternatives that offered these features (or they weren't widely known).\n\nI know they have 3rd-party plugins now and people do some interesting stuff with them. That's another reason I see Roam mentioned here.\n\nAlso, Roam used to be free until this summer.\n\nRoam introduced me to Zettelkasten which is a great method for maintaining a knowledge base.\n\nSo if you want a knowledge base, my recommendation for most people is to learn Zettelkasten (How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens is a great book) then pick a simple markdown editor with links (zettlr or obsidian.md seem to be good. if you're into Emacs, use org+org-roam). i.e. you don't need roam for that.",

That's a good way to create a personal knowledge base and that's what most people did. I looked around at that time, but there were little alternatives that offered these features (or they weren't widely known).\n\nI know they have 3rd-party plugins now and people do some interesting stuff with them. That's another reason I see Roam mentioned here.\n\nAlso, Roam used to be free until this summer.\n\nRoam introduced me to Zettelkasten which is a great method for maintaining a knowledge base.\n\nSo if you want a knowledge base, my recommendation for most people is to learn Zettelkasten (How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens is a great book) then pick a simple markdown editor with links (zettlr or obsidian.md seem to be good. if you're into Emacs, use org+org-roam). i.e. you don't need roam for that."
