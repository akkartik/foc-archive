Has anyone worked through “Software Foundations”, and did you find it valuable?

Is it <a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/">this one</a>? I read it years ago when it was still one single book and only contained the first two volumes. While I don't think it has much relevance to the main topic of FoC I'd say it's a really good one for what it aims to do and I would definitely recommend it to undergraduate or even high school students (kids could get seriously advanced these days...) who are ambitious enough.
