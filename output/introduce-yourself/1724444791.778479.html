Hi everyone! I'm <a href="https://github.com/kaBeech">Kyle</a>!<br/><br/>The Future Of Coding podcast won my heart about a year ago by being the first tech podcast I found where I got the impression that the hosts had read <a href="https://xkcd.com/917/">Douglas Hofstadter</a>. It's my favorite podcast short of <a href="https://cocaineandrhinestones.com/">Cocaine &amp; Rhinestones</a>.<br/><br/>I'm a Pharmacy Technician and part-time Software Engineer (slowly working towards a full-time role). I'm into punk culture, Functional Programming, and the relationship between AI and human cognition.<br/><br/>I've been aware of the Slack for almost as long as the podcast, but I'm socially anxious and avoided joining until I had a reason to do so. But I just published a project inspired by Beyond Efficiency by Dave Ackley (see #share-your-work) so I figured it was time to come home. I'm happy to be here and meet y'all! :blue_heart:
