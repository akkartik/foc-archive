About complexity, I think that actually programming is an act to manage complexity. My job as a programmer is to tackle a complex problem and produce a solution to it that it is manageable and the most easy to reason about as possible. So the complexity is the "matter" that we mold as programmers. All tooling and language are attempts to help us in that task, and their goal is to "simplify" complexity.
