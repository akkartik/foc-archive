Hi,<br/><br/>Here's my update about the progress that I made last weekend. Sometime ago I started working on <a href="https://github.com/devhelpr/expressionrunner">https://github.com/devhelpr/expressionrunner</a> , which is library to parse and execute expressions<br/>with support for named variables. This weekend I added support for more operators like & | % << >> and so on.<br/>This allows me to extend my tixy land implementation and it is now more in line with the original. But that's not the end goal offcourse.<br/>I want for example to be able to use this expressionrunner for visibility conditions of form fields (in the form-nodes, which is also a new feature) but also in<br/>my "mini excel"-data-grid node as formulas to reference cells (I've already got the basis covered).

The expressionrunner library also has support to extend it with functions like Math.sin or your own. These can be used from within the expressions. Quite powerful I think

Some background: The expression is parsed to a tree structure which can be reused to execute the expression multiple times

Hey man, this is really neat work. I like where you are taking this. Would just love to have a bit more iconic stuff on the left panel and a bit more polish on the design, but it is looking pretty nifty. Good job!

Thanks! Yes I know that the design definitely needs a lot of polish, it currently doesn't have my main focus because of limited time unfortunately. I am focussing more on the working of the flowrunner and the functional part of the UI and not so much how it looks. Although I know that design is very important.

I also like it a lot! I agree about the look of the left panel which I find very cryptic. But the global design is OK for someone who doesn't take too much time on it. It is clear.<br/><br/>It is also great that you too implement yet another tixy.land! Seems to be the new TodoList showcase! :smile:

I've been trying to convince people that we should standardize the concept of a "generic expression language"... so I designed this: <a href="http://loyc.net/les/">http://loyc.net/les/</a><br/><br/>Admittedly there isn't a JavaScript version yet, but I wonder, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Maikel van de Lisdonk</span>, if you would be interested in using a standardized syntax like this for your expression language.<br/><br/>At its core, though, my idea is less about standardizing syntax and more about standardizing the in-memory syntax tree between different languages, and so there are two modestly different versions of the syntax right now, and then there is Enhanced C#, which is a superset of C# based on these same syntax trees.
