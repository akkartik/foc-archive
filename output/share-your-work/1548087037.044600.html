As many of you know, I'm obsessed with original-Conal-Elliott FRP. It took be forever to understand it, so I've balked at trying to explain it to others.<br/><br/>Last week, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span> convinced me to spend some real time on an essay to explain it. I just finished draft 1. (So please don't share around on social media just yet.)<br/><br/><a href="https://futureofcoding.org/drafts/dctp">https://futureofcoding.org/drafts/dctp</a><br/><br/>The essay was written for people who already like ReactJS and functional programming, and maybe even have some Haskell experience.<br/><br/>It's at least a 20-minute read, so give it a go when you get a chance. No rush. At this stage, I'm looking for birds-eye-view feedback. Do you follow the overall argument arc? If not, where do you fall through the cracks? Does the tone work for you or is it too informal?<br/><br/>Really appreciate anyone taking the time to review and give feedback. This piece is important to me :heart:

My main critique: the article feels disjointed, and the primary claims aren’t sufficiently backed up by the examples. For example, you introduce denotational programming, along with three fairly abstract claims about its benefits. Then you explain the basics of continuous time and interactivity, but those lessons aren’t placed in context of your claims. I think a much stronger article would have a main running example. You would implement that example in both “normal” JS and in your alternative version. You could demonstrate how simple extensions to your example are easy in the FRP version (showing modularity), and perhaps you could embed a subtle bug in the JS version (showing how reasoning is more difficult).

As it stands, the examples provided are not enough to convince me of your claims, particularly since some of them (like the odd-button-generator) are contrived.

I would focus on having significantly smaller scope to the article. “FRP Will Save Programming” is an extremely broad claim that’s difficult to defend. Distill out the essential concepts of FRP/DTCP/whatnot, show a few concise examples, maybe add your generalizations at the end.

One last thing: I would focus your efforts on the “interactivity” section. The continuous time part makes perfect sense--representing graphics as a pure function of time--but the interactivity part lost me. There’s a lot of helper functions here I don’t understand, there’s a framework I don’t understand, and none of it is really explained. What is a <tt>function*</tt>? Why is this a coroutine? Is this the simplest way to implement these functions? This is a serious concern, because I would imagine most JS people reading this would think “wow this is crazy Haskell code. I could do this just as easily with a for loop and a counter variable.” You run the risk of turning people off from the paradigm.

I think you should consider what points you want to make. Why should people care about this new perspective? You already enumerated a few reasons in the denotative programming section, so just go for those. “FRP Can Simplify UI Programming” seems like a sensible title for such a perspective.

Actual last thing… I’m not a huge fan of the example in from Li Haoyi’s blog. It feels like a strawman. In standard OOP practice, I would write:<br/><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap"><br/>fingers = fingers.soak2seconds(sugar2.dissolve(espresso))<br/>mixture<br/>  .beat(cheese.beat())<br/>  .fold(cream)<br/>  .assemble(fingers)<br/>  ...<br/></pre><br/><br/>And that reads way more naturally to me than the denotational version, which has the classic “inside-out” functional programming readability issue.

That's an interesting point. I may need to look at it more closely but I think your OOP syntax isnt incompatible with denotational principles

&gt; The only solution is to “move I/O entirely out of our programming model into the implementation of a denotationally simple model for whole systems.”<br/><br/>So DCTP can used only as a DSL inside something bigger and imperative, right? Seems like there is no way around it.

Gonna come back with some feedback in a bit, after I've finished the first read-through, but...<br/><br/>I mentioned the Haskellcast Conal interview, about 9 months ago, in a video chat we had with Shaun Lebron and Dennis Heihoff. Maybe you heard about it before that — :shrug: — but if that was the first time it crossed your path, well, I'm glad it played a part in leading to this essay! It's a fantastic discussion, agreed.

A bunch of random comments: sorry if this is harsh<br/><br/>I've seen that example of tiramisu before and the first is *<b>far more easy to follow</b>* than the second.<br/><br/>To me it's like reverse polish notation (RPN) vs infix or whatever it's called. As someone with lisp experience and forth experience I get RPN but I count myself as an exception. I'm sure all of you get it too but the average person will be lost. I don't agree that having to dig through a bunch of nested parentheses some how makes the data flow obvious. The first one seems vastly more obvious to me. Step 1 flows to step 2, step 2 flows to step 3, etc.  Yes, as a programmer I get all the benefits of the RPN tiramisu recipe but that's not how people think. They read a recipe top to bottom and follow the top instructions before they bottom.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm not denying the RPN style is better for many definitions of better but one of those benefits is not "The beauty of the denotational style is that the flow of data is so clear"<br/><br/>It's not clear at all. Rather, after you've spent time parsing it in your mind you can deduce a bunch of things you can't with the top style. But "clear"? Not even a little<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Another benefit claims to be "Equational reasoning. In denotational programming, the equal sign (=) means what it does in a mathematics textbook"<br/><br/>Being like a math textbooks is not better except for mathematicians. Most people find math equations cryptic and hard to parse.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The first GPU area where you made functions to draw moire patterns and circle also set off alarm bells. Shadertoy is a famous site which I guess you could call DCTP for fragment shaders. But, they show how poor this style works for real world problems. Compare any shadertoy shader that draws a city or a forest to an actual game that draws a city or a forest. The shadertoy shader will run at less than 1fps fullscreen. The game will run at 60fps on the same computer and if it's it a good game will look significantly better.<br/><br/>I know your point was demonstrate something else, just pointing out it was raising concerns with it's direction and is related to a recent thread I started which is that FRP/DCTP seems to fail at perf at scale without just as much extra engineering as non FRP/DCTP.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I got lost at the first counter example. I know what <tt>function*</tt> means and <tt>yield</tt> but it was not remotely clear how yielding a button, followed by the next yield (no clue what it's doing even ignoring liftnow and sample), and then it yields a span. Em, okay, a function that's yielding 3 completely unrelated types? Yea, completely lost.<br/><br/>After that it seemed to meander with a bunch of claims with no real connection. I kind of got lost.

One thing that did stick out though is more of the same, this claim<br/><br/>&gt;  I would describe how I want my HTML to look like for any value of state, and then React would figure out what it needs to do (virtual-dom-diffing) to mutate the DOM to look the way I want it to (JQuery-esque mutations). I no longer have to worry about manually, imperatively keeping the state and the DOM in sync. React does it for me<br/><br/>As pointed out above this is not my experience. It might be the goal but the overhead of managing all those hidden objects ends up killing perf on any non-trivial project and so the abstraction leaks as you have to add more and more ways to prevent react from shuffling so many DOM objects around.<br/><br/>I blame that on the DOM, not on React, but I feel like it's kind of a truism that idealism often fails against reality.<br/><br/>Maybe a good example would actually be a spreadsheet in react with a toolbar showing various formatting options. The toolbar needs to reflect the format of the currently selected cell, possibly multiple cells. Updating any individual cell or cell format, the naive solution would have react generate some intermediate format (virtual dom) of 30 or 40 toolbar settings and then 390 cells (just checked the default Google Spreadsheet on my laptop).  It would then diff all 420 objects only to up the properties of 1 cell.<br/><br/>The amount of work required to make it just deal with an individual cell and ignore everything else so you get better perf I think is still unfortunately a  important problem with React style FRP.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Gregg Tavares</span> and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Will Crichton</span> really nailed my feedback.<br/><br/>- :heart: the introduction -  it's easy and fun read, very human, discusses people, the process of learning and etymology. I would enjoy an article just on etymology!<br/>- code examples were tough going: too much effort to understand the point being made. I only have stamina for one or two in an article before I glaze and skip them unless they are really easy to grok.<br/>- trig triggers mathematical allergies - can they be even simpler e.g. just linear movement?<br/>- x2 <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Gregg Tavares</span>, side-by-side compare/contrast to clarify the argument would really help<br/><br/><br/>- I haven't left the article understanding quite how my react-ish FRP conflicts with Conal's FRP<br/>- Continuous time seems easy/obvious for continuous trig functions. Imperative code would likely use time arguments too. I don't know how it applies to stateful iterative things e.g. game of life or practical animation concerns like "how much work can I fit in this frame to achieve 60fps"?<br/><br/>The argument I take away is that FRP is<br/>i) easier to optimise<br/>ii) nice because its a tree of mathematical expressions<br/><br/>For me, these are not the path to "saving programming", they are are in fact curses holding it back. They sacrifice human concerns for making the compiler's life easy and mathematical purity respectively. Like <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Will Crichton</span>, RPN came to my mind - it's cool to calculator geeks but a total UX fail for normies.<br/><br/>IMHO there is nothing more user hostile and disenfranchising than formal mathematics. If anything, language design has more to learn from recipe sites than algebra e.g. simple lists of ingredients and equipment as well as the process instructions, photos of intermediate results, videos of the whole process, prediction of time taken, comment rolls for users to share feedback and improvements. They prioritize sharing understanding whereas algebra feels like compression/encryption.<br/><br/>Can the argument be made in terms of human concerns not mathematical ones? e.g. can you disprove the claim "We naturally talk and think imperatively, therefore imperative style is the easiest way for us to instruct a computer to perform a task."?

It's a start, the beginnings of an essay I'd really like to share.  To add to others' good feedback, I'll reiterate that the DCTP body text doesn't match up with the introduction.  I expected to see React-inspired frameworks fall down in a way that DCTP does not.

The Denotational bullets 1,2,3 come to a theme of untangling accidental dependencies of imperative state transitions.  Consider that every operator in an imperative program is a function from the world state to the world state where it's a bit hard to say how much of the world is being examined or updated by each operator.  (Though scope and encapsulation are about imposing limits.)<br/><br/>Besides that, you do a fine job of pointing out that Denotational is treeish whereas control flow is linear.  (Though control flow does often have a subtask tree, but the subtasks either ordered or quickly become a concurrent tangle.)<br/><br/>Continuity is a hard sell.  The story of SVG rasterization is a good start.  (Do we yet have a decent SVG editor yet?  There are too few of us who cling to the mosaic effect of pixel art – long live Deluxe Paint.)  Animation effects are good too because you want them to start and end on time with interpolation in the middle.  The Behaviors/Events division has always rubbed me the wrong way.  (Similar with continuous and discrete probability distributions.)<br/><br/>Moreover, "infinity of points" has become outright painful.  (I absolutely forgive it since most people talk this way, but it is <b>wrong</b> all the same.)  Continuity actually gives you the exact opposite of many points.  A circle <b>is</b> a point together with a radius that's a full description.  From those parameters you can construct or sample many points related to the circle, but those are more qualities of the space, of the "mathematical functions" available than of the circle by itself.  We don't "store" infinitely many points; we imply them!

There are a lot of great points here, especially from Will and William. I made a few attempts to write up my thoughts, but they never converged on anything as helpful — I just kept going off the deep end ranting about sampling (which.. again, Will and William nailed).<br/><br/>Best advice I can give is.. pay close attention to the fact that Conal's FRP was created to tell people how to make animations. Conal's FRP basically says, "Use sampling of continuous functions, rather than sprite sequences, or code that assumes a fixed timestep — and write code in a compositional style so that you can build bigger animations by combining smaller animations." The nice dovetailing of those two ideas is what makes FRP great <em>for coding computer-generated animations.</em> If you want to stretch the definition of FRP to cover other problem domains (eg: GUIs), it's not worth spending a lot of time covering the motivating examples for the original FRP (continuous time and space), because that's just a history lesson. I'd suggest distilling the references to time and space down to a single sentence, or a paragraph at most, or make that stuff a separate post about the history of FRP as an addendum to your post about FRP for GUIs. Rather, figure out what it is about FRP that works so well for GUIs you can capture the gist of it in a sentence, the equivalent of, "Use sampling of continuous functions, rather than sprite sequences, or code that assumes a fixed timestep — and write code in a compositional style so that you can build bigger animations by combining smaller animations."

&gt; The nice dovetailing of those two ideas is what makes FRP great <em>for coding computer-generated animations.</em><br/><br/>As an aside, it's worth noting that sprite sequences remain an <em>extremely</em> popular form of animation in 2D games (and elsewhere). There are games that attempt to do generative animation but preserve the look of sprite animation, or a hybrid (eg: <a href="http://joarportfolio.com/rainWorld.html">http://joarportfolio.com/rainWorld.html</a>), but they're the exception and the results have never been fantastic. Many games even write their physics assuming a fixed pixel-size, rather than going resolution independent. There are strong motivations for taking this approach, beyond just "old games were like that so it's nostalgic" or "writing continuous time/space stuff is hard". So what we see in games is a world where both approaches — continuous and discrete — coexist, both for time and space.

Game physics is a good example a behavior (stuff moving) generating events (collisions) generating behavior (stuff moving in a new direction).

Haven't finished reading the whole thing yet, but the description of infinite screen size reminds me of the typical way you implement "metaballs" (common in demoscene).

I think you need more details on how you handle events in this model. I see the code sample but can't wrap my head around it from just your prose. The animation examples are easy to follow, but they don't mix in any events.
