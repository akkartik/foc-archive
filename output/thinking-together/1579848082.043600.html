JS and Lua feel to me to be more related to Netwonscript which was inspired by Self, but maybe this is just convergent evolution. I agree with Edward that JS is far from an ideal high level language, but it has most of the high level features one might want to build on (besides coroutines) and feels cleaner (to me) than many others (Perl, Python, Ruby, Java).
