Projects like this are absolutely necessary to drive the “future of coding” forward because it’s more people than it is about “code”, the future of coding is about people not code.\n\nCreating anything in the digital space is a two way street: Human to computer and computer to human. This work clearly falls under the human to computer, as does NeuralLink and Kernel. They solve the bandwidth interface issue as well as some complexities in translation (i.e. the act of physically programming or diagramming). These products satisfy one aspect of the future of coding as other products satisfy the other: how do humans understand\/read\/organize\/explore what they created?",

Code, on it’s own, is useless; much like a hammer without something to nail. Projects like this are absolutely necessary to drive the “future of coding” forward because it’s more people than it is about “code”, the future of coding is about people not code.\n\nCreating anything in the digital space is a two way street: Human to computer and computer to human. This work clearly falls under the human to computer, as does NeuralLink and Kernel. They solve the bandwidth interface issue as well as some complexities in translation (i.e. the act of physically programming or diagramming). These products satisfy one aspect of the future of coding as other products satisfy the other: how do humans understand\/read\/organize\/explore what they created?"
