Learning to use symbols and knowledge in new ways, across groups, across cultures, is a powerful, valuable, and very human goal. And it is also one that is obtainable, if we only begin to open our minds to full, complete use of computers to augment our most human of capabilities.  In the computer we have a tool that does not just move earth or bend steel, but we have a tool that actually can portray symbols in new ways.  We have a tool that radically extends our capabilities in the very area that makes us most human, and most powerful.<br/><br/>Douglas Engelbart said that, or something close it.
