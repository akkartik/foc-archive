This position + orientation is then used to set the position\/rotation of the object pTorus1 in the scene.\n\nThe artist of course doesn't see any of this: they just have basic nodes that allow them to query such data, every node and its properties are rich with descriptions, making it easy to hover over anything and know a) what it does and b) what it expects as a connection.\nThere's still lots of things that I'd love to improve on the user experience here.
