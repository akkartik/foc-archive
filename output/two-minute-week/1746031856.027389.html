I'm working on nice UI for working with assembly instruction cards recently. Today I've spent some time fiddling around with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span>'s <a href="https://github.com/ivanreese/knob">https://github.com/ivanreese/knob</a> trying to use it for switching condition codes in a smooth manner. Condition codes are discrete values, and there are just 16 of them but it feels nice to switch them out in a continuous manner. Still not finished but the results look interesting so sharing them here. (<a href="https://github.com/mafik/automat/blob/main/src/knob.cc">code</a>)<br/><br/>A key component of the gesture logic is fitting a circle to a bunch of points. Turns out it's really hard. I've wasted quite a bit of time before stumbling on Nikaolai Chernov's excellent home page: <a href="https://people.cas.uab.edu/~mosya/cl/CPPcircle.html">https://people.cas.uab.edu/~mosya/cl/CPPcircle.html</a> . Strongly recommend bookmarking this one - you never know when you'll have to fit a circle to your data!

No idea why it uploaded as binary. Here is a re-encoded version.
