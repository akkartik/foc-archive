The reason Idris, et al, are woefully inadequate to provide executable specifications is that they contain neither a database model nor a graphical/interactive model. 90% of the code in games is related to tracking user interaction or drawing, and only a small part of any typical graphical interactive product could possibly be programmed in the academic tools. Since a lot of products have aesthetic aspects like ease of learning and use, that are every bit as important as calculating a sum correctly, i find every single proving system to be utterly useless in my day to day work. I want the computer to catch as many errors as possible, without inducing extra work.
