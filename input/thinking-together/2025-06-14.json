If I had to conjure up some kind of description today, I’d say:\n\n*Standards* feel like enforced hardness to me; we put into rules what we think is best to create robustness. They are mostly analytic and propositional. Not everyone agrees and sometimes we need to break rules to get somewhere better. Hard in the heavy and rigid way, if it breaks it shatters.\n\n*Protocols* feel very close to standards, until you consider agreements born out of pragmatism protocols as well (what we may call _de facto standards_). Hardness emerges at least partially out of practice and experience. \n\n*Patterns* feel more like some abstract ingredient for both standards and protocols. Some repeating structure that grabs our attention, perhaps because we feel their significance, even though we can’t necessarily explain it. Our subconscious bubbles them up into our consciousness.\n\nIt feels like _trust_ becomes less and less important the deeper you go on this hierarchy.\n\n_What does this have to do with this thread?_\nNot sure. Felt relevant to me. Can’t describe why…",

That was a time with significant diversity and innovation in hardware, including processors. MIPS, PowerPC, Dec Alpha, etc. Every machine came with its own compilers (mostly Fortran for us scientists), and language standards were crucial for code portability. Few people were willing to commit to one hardware\/compiler platform, as they knew it might disappear a few years later. It was common practice to test one's code on different machines. And platform vendors advertises standards compliance. The narrow waist of the time was standard Fortran, not x86 machine code.",

That was a time with significant diversity and innovation in hardware, including processors. MIPS, PowerPC, Dec Alpha, etc. Every machine came with its own compilers (mostly Fortran for us scientists), and language standards were crucial for code portability. Few people were willing to commit to one hardware\/compiler platform, as they knew it might disappear a few years later. It was common practice to test one's code on different machines. And platform vendors advertises standards compliance. The narrow waist of the time was standard Fortran, not x86 machine code."
