It is mainly a tutorial to get you started with the environment.\n\nI do understand the need for a short trailer-format presentation of the capabilities.\n\nThe 3D scene you create is only a stepping stone.\n\nSo far, I have mainly used it for light programming and setting up audio reactive, interactive and kinetic objects, in essence dealing with real-life objects.\n\nThink stage lighting, LEDs, eg:\n<https:\/\/youtu.be\/9Njcf-cxLxg>\n\nPhysically interactable objects, eg:\n<https:\/\/youtu.be\/gG3_ubrUpfg>\n\nLately I've been also exploring using it as a VJ tool:\n<https:\/\/youtu.be\/EbdbSbtwrvA>\n\nI highly suggest you check out <https:\/\/schema.scenic.tools\/gallery\/> for more examples.\n\nThe thing is, though, in essence Schéma is a general multi-purpose toolkit much in the vein of vvvv or TouchDesigner.\n\nBut it's more opinionated in how it treats various IO, scene recall, objects, data structures, DMX channel mapping, MIDI inputs, etc.\n\nThis reduces some of the flexibility but lets you not reinvent the wheel and lends the whole environment a consistent feel. with the internals knowing how to talk to one another.\n\nThis way, even entirely new functionality, such as multiuser sessions, can be brought in in the form of a plugin.\n\nAnd using standard supported communication protocols such as OSC you're able to integrate Schéma with other tools.\n\nThink for instance using MaxMSP to generate audio and then sending OSC triggers to activate light sequences authored in Schéma.\n\n*TL;DR*\nUse it to drive lights, generate visuals, create interactive media installations, integrate with other tools and think of new creative uses while you quickly iterate in the live environment.",
