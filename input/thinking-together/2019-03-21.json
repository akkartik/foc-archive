But as for a simple general purpose language taking a lot of man-hours, the evidence from the Red, Eve, Luna, and Beads projects shows that thousands of man-hours are indeed input into such a project. To be general purpose, you have to test it against a diverse set of project types, from games, to business applications to scientific, all the while making adjustments to keep smoothing the rough spots, while trying to keep it simple. If you exclude data storage and graphical interface\/event management, and imagine we are still in the 70's on terminals, you can probably crank out a simple language like Lua or Python easily enough, but i don't expect any new general purpose language to catch on if it can't do interaction and at least touch on client-server types of programs. We already have acceptable terminal-based languages that can't draw or interact, i don't think we need any more. Swift, which is probably the best designed language from the major players, is representative of the end of the road of OOP. Certainly the Apple development community has strongly embraced it, and i think it has a very good percentage of use in the Apple ecosystem, ramping up faster than hardly any other language.  Another aspect of language design that sucks up the man-hours is the diverse range of platforms that are now extant: you have wristwatch computers, mobile phones, tablets, desktops, browser apps, game consoles, VR headsets, AR headsets, so many more platforms than before, and so many more devices to connect with. This is one of the big reasons for example Swift got taken up so fast: if you want an Apple Watch App, you are very likely going to be using XCode and one of only 2 languages. It is very hard for new languages to cover the full breadth of computing today. If you get down into the nitty-gritty of the GPU, you are talking tens of thousands of hours to master each of the commonly used GPU's. This is why people use Adobe AIR, and Unity, and Unreal Engine, because those systems did the really low level work of learning the hardware and making a reasonable layer on top of the hardware to make it feasible. You will note therefore that most of the projects listed on Steve Krouse's spreadsheet are 2D products, because a 3D platform is a truly massive undertaking, and a moving target because 3D hardware is iterating fast.",

(Well, sorta.)\n\nShared-virtual-world games like Fortnite (and Minecraft before it) are successful primarily due to their status as digital social environments. In fact, these sorts of games are increasingly taking over the role of “third places”, or semi-public community hangout spaces (<https:\/\/medium.com\/s\/greatescape\/fortnite-is-so-much-more-than-a-game-3ca829f389f4>).\n\nOne of the big problems with these new digital third places is that they’re not open to improvement or modification by the people who spend their time there. The rules of Fortnite, and the map you play on, are determined by some distant corporation; even if everyone in a given player community would favor a certain adjustment to the rules, there’s no way for that community to implement their desired change short of petitioning the developers to implement it globally. Making digital third places approachably programmable from within would change this dynamic, while simultaneously giving a whole bunch of people both a motive and a means to learn to program.\n\nWe can look to MUDs as a key source of inspiration here. MUDs embody a tradition of allowing players to shape their shared digital world – including, in some cases, by scripting dynamic behaviors for NPCs and objects. Getting approachable scripting tools embedded in a widely used modern digital social environment would be a major coup in terms of giving users back some control over the digital spaces they inhabit.\n\nSituating a “future of programming” vision in this context also suggests a particular focus on building tools that enable communities of novice user-programmers to collaborate, self-govern, and learn together. Empowering individual users to shape the environment is necessary but not sufficient; the real leverage will come from empowering small communities of people with varying levels of skill and interest.\n\nYou can maybe think of the end goal here as something like a community code-garden, where most users know just enough about how to program the environment that they can chip in to help improve it in small ways here and there. Meanwhile, a few informally designated “local experts” will sometimes step up to take the lead on larger-scale changes or improvements.\n\nI keep meaning to write about this at greater length, but here’s a related Twitter thread I wrote when some of this stuff first clicked for me: <https:\/\/twitter.com\/maxkreminski\/status\/1030838313429528576>",
