Hey. I am working on the Ara project, a social network platform to build projects together. For a general information here is the landing page: <a href="https://ara.foundation/">https://ara.foundation/</a><br/><br/>I did the research (Here is the link: <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVN1CP7ck=/?share_link_id=508424426161">https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVN1CP7ck=/?share_link_id=508424426161</a>) and I am quite excited to meet some of the folks that I encountered there. Actually FoC helped me a lot during the research.<br/><br/>As for the sharing, I want to publish the whitepaper, but I need your feedback. Especially critical points if i have the flaws on my thesis.<br/><br/>Much appreciation your feedback:<br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LJ5JbHMg0y_GjJTWoISxVAqR9issBYlpyzuE1FqFHYw/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LJ5JbHMg0y_GjJTWoISxVAqR&hellip;</a>

A few small notes:<br/>• The miro is lots of fun. The information density (very sparse) makes it a bit hard to approach, but once I felt my way through the rough shape it became more comprehensible. Surely, this must be very helpful as a research aid for you. I'd love to see this info put together into a more sharable form. (Note to self: the visual programming codex sucks and needs an overhaul!)<br/>• The white paper is long enough that I haven't yet taken the time to read it in depth, just gave it a quick skim, so apologies if any of my feedback is inappropriate or unhelpful. You've put a lot of work into this and deserve a deeper read/reflection from someone, but I won't be able to be that person, at least not right now. With that being said, here's some quick / superficial feedback, in case it helps.<br/>• This project seems <em>very</em> broad. I describe these sorts of projects as "burn it all down and start over" or "reinvent the universe". Like, I repeatedly had to ask myself "wait, doesn't 'the web' already do this?" It's unclear to me whether you feel there's a targeted, specific problem at the root of it all, one that could be addressed with a surgical fix to our technology, and are incrementally feeling your way toward a better understanding of that problem — if so, great, keep going. Or, instead, if you started from a place of "computers could be better" broadly and accumulated a whole laundry list of things that could be done differently and tried to pull them together — if so, you're signing up for a much harder challenge, one that will require the involvement of many people, and thus you'll need to work very hard on communicating the problem and convincing people to help. So note the difference: one of these is a problem you can solve with design and invention, the other is a problem you'll need to solve with communication and community. It might be worth thinking about what sort of work you enjoy doing, and what sort of feedback / criticism you're interested in receiving, and whether that's the sort of work/reflection that you'll need to do to see this project through to completion.

Small things:<br/>• Steve <em>Krouse</em> is spelled incorrectly in a few places. Also, while he started the FoC community, he hasn't been active here since 2020.<br/>• The "SomethingNew" community doesn't actually maintain that spreadsheet you linked in footnote 28. That spreadsheet is by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Duncan Cragg</span>, for this community. (And I think <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dan Cook</span> has withdrawn from being active in the broader SomethingNew / FoC / etc sphere of communities, and thus SomethingNew has fallen dormant.)

I miss Dan Cook. I've been reminded of his posts and comments multiple times in 2024. I only found out about <a href="https://github.com/d-cook/SomethingNew">https://github.com/d-cook/SomethingNew</a> this year when I went looking for him.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Ivan Reese</span> Thanks for your feedback. I will rewrite the whitepaper to make it more clear and concise. As for unclarity, that is it that there is a root of problem, that I try to address, or that I try to combine bunch of technologies together which is hard thing to do, I think its both. But I will rewrite it to reduce to the core aspect. :)<br/><br/>From the point of reinventing the whole universe, its exactly opposite. Rather than reinventing, I try to build on top of current existing technology. But only one thing that I want to replace is the web browsers that it should be a web operating system where data between websites are transferrable. That web operating system must be a productivity workplace. :slightly_smiling_face:
