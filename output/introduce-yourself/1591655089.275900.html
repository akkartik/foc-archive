Hi, I've long been in pursuit of great code. That's taken me on a journey to explore the creation of programming langauges and their influences. I would love to connect with others that have felt like the current languages hold them back.

Welcome! If you're willing to share, I'd be curious to hear about the sorts of languages that strike you as interesting. I might be able to point you to some of the projects we have going on here that you may enjoy. Also, how did you find out about us?

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jason Hobbs</span> be sure to look at the spreadsheet showing the various active languages projects. There are at least 25 in various stages of development covering client, server-side, music production, etc. More projects that you have time to study i'll wager.

My thoughts on "great code", if you want to discuss it further:<br/><br/>I'm certain there are things that developers do to make huge messes of code, that no advancement in language or tooling alone will fix. It's mostly about detangling things and keeping it simple (e.g. not building a cathedral when all you need was an awning).<br/><br/>One thing that gets in the way is that the model is not in the code, it's in the developer's head. The code is just a very cumbersome <em>description</em> of that model. One has to work very hard to mentally deconstruct code and reconstruct the actual model (i.e. what is this code actually doing?) in one's head.<br/><br/>I've found ways to do that deconstruction / reconstruction in the code itself, so that (regardless of language or tooling) it much more closely matches the human mental model of what it actually is.<br/><br/>One thing I'm hoping to achieve with my FOC projects is making the design/flow of code very apparent, so that (for example) connecting two APIs can be done by just reaching in and connecting A to B and C to D, and then boom, it works. If I can make it that tangible, then there'd be less tendency to build a city for each API and a department of transportation for the few things they exchange, etc.

&gt; I’ve found ways to do that deconstruction / reconstruction in the code itself, so that (regardless of language or tooling) it much more closely matches the human mental model of what it actually is.<br/>Sound interesting! Can you share more details of how you’re doing it?<br/><br/>A big problem I always find in projects, is that our understanding always evolves and gets better. Both in coding/technical topics as in understanding of the domain problem. But as our understanding evolves is really hard to go back and update old code, it’s a big hassle doing it as it needs to be done manually. Anyone has thoughts on how to solve this?

I'll have to do that some other time, and maybe on a new thread.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jason Hobbs</span> - Do you have examples of languages (or language features) that hold you back? Or some that do the opposite?<br/><br/>I really like Go's (and TypeScript's) implicit interfaces, Haskell-like pattern matching, and most of the new features of C# 7 and 8.
