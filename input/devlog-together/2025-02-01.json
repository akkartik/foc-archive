If you do a drag it can be really sensitive to the singularity that exists near the center which is where you naturally start a drag  so its pretty interesting you are removing that singularity with a local center of rotation.

I just did the up or right for +ve and it just seems wrong when its at certain angles. If you do a drag it can be really sensitive to the singularity that exists near the center which is where you naturally start a drag  so its pretty interesting you are removing that singularity with a local center of rotation.
