Now this is interesting because as I started to use software like zettlr. I soon found small issues one after another but that ultimately added so much up that I decided not to use it. And now Gtoolkit seems to bring in the smalltalk approach which gives me as a User ( smalltalk able programmer) the ability to mold the tool in ways which I need. Runar from unison was also in the loop. I would love to have a more functional language like scala , unison or clojure (see early efforts cloxp) available in such an environment.
