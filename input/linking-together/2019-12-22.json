Bret Victor's work showed prototypes of a future programming interface that is proving extremely difficult to invent. I have little doubt that future programming interfaces will be much more \"live\" and interactive. Fairly easy to mock-up isolated examples, but extremely difficult to build in practice on larger real projects. Another great counter-example are the written works of Jules Verne. He predicted the future so accurately, and so far in advance, that his novels were not accepted by his publisher as fiction, but were considered wild fantasies and therefore only suitable for children. He predicted ecoterrorism, radar, television, rays of unusual qualities, aerial combat, and probably 100 more things that actually happened, that were many decades ahead of their invention.",
