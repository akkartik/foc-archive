In fact, I think finding an appropriate name is going to be a lot harder without a clearly defined AIM. Once you have a reason for existing, the name usually comes almost naturally. So my advice would be to propose the existence of some unnamed community circle, with version 1 of the AIM for that circle, membership being anyone on this server who wishes to be a member of the circle, with the first order of business being selecting people as Lead, Facilitator, and Secretary, followed immediately by \"what should we do about the name\" as agenda item 1.",

In fact, I think finding an appropriate name is going to be a lot harder without a clearly defined AIM. Once you have a reason for existing, the name usually comes almost naturally. So my advice would be to propose the existence of some unnamed community circle, with version 1 of the AIM for that circle, membership being anyone on this server who wishes to be a member of the circle, with the first order of business being selecting people as Lead, Facilitator, and Secretary, followed immediately by \"what should we do about the name\" as agenda item 1."
