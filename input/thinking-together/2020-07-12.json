        "text": "&gt;  As someone who's built an fexpr-based Lisp: no, Red is not like fexprs.\nThe original post was about Rebol, and I was talking about Rebol, not Red. Rebol and Red are different.\nThere are two kinds of Lisp dialect.\n• In the Macro dialects (modern compiled dialects like Common Lisp and Scheme), there are no FEXPRs. Instead, there are Macros, which receive their arguments as unevaluated syntax objects. There are two phases of evaluation. Calls to macros are expanded at compile time, not at run time. Macros are not first class values. \n• In the FEXPR dialects, you have FEXPR objects, which are like functions, except that the arguments are unevaluated syntax objects. FEXPRs are first class values. There is only one phase of evaluation: calls to FEXPRs are evaluated at run time. These dialects are interpreted, not compiled. Older examples are Lisp 1.5 and 3Lisp (these are historical dialects, not used today). A newer example is the Kernel language, a dialect of Scheme with FEXPRs instead of Macros, with multiple implementations on github: <http:\/\/web.cs.wpi.edu\/~jshutt\/kernel.html>\nEverything I said about FEXPR Lisp dialects seems to be also true of Rebol, and everything I said about Macro Lisp dialects seems to be also true of Red. So that is how I am categorizing Rebol and Red, pending more information. This page from the Red language site seems to confirm what I just wrote: <https:\/\/www.red-lang.org\/2016\/12\/entering-world-of-macros.html>",

My Curv language has exactly 2 levels because Curv can be either interpreted on a CPU, or it can be compiled into GPU shader code and run on a GPU. The run time requirements for these two execution environments are quite different. On the GPU, I can't have a garbage collector, or first class function values, or general run-time polymorphism, whereas on the CPU, I can. So any Curv code that runs on the GPU is restricted to a statically typed subset of Curv. This statically typed subset is upward compatible with the full language, and GPU code can be executed on the CPU without any ceremony, so it feels like you are programming in a single language.\n\nThe Red language is claimed to be suitable for writing operating systems. You don't want to have a garbage-collected runtime environment inside an operating system kernel, because garbage collection pauses are incompatible with real time programming. For example, you need to be able process interrupts with guaranteed latency bounds. From <http:\/\/Red-lang.org|Red-lang.org>, \"*Red\/System* is a C level language, where you are responsible for allocating and freeing memory, and where you may need precise manual control over those actions.\"\n\nI know that the Lisp machine operating system was written in Lisp.

Saying, \"A is just like B\" flattens a lot of the richness, I think. Even if an idea was \"invented by Lisp first,\" there's still been lots of parallel evolution that has converged in surprising ways. Rebol is worth framing as its own thing, on the same order as Forth. It's not a Lisp derivative."

Political revolutions that try to do away with elites invariably seem to either fail quickly, or install new elites without meaning to. So the question for me is not how to get rid of elites, but how to try and ensure the ones we end up with are better than the last lot.",
