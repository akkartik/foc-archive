Lately I try to use GSheets a lot. I write custom formulas and its tests in typescript and upload them via <a href="https://github.com/google/clasp">https://github.com/google/clasp</a> . It is quite nice. To catch errors (unintended use of a formula) and make it visible to the formula user (myself atm, but that might change) I create “error cells” and/or conditional formatting.<br/><br/>To me, being able to inspect the pure data itself has a lot of value, because in a pipeline things might go wrong and it is nice to be able to have a glance at all the data.<br/><br/>My question is: do you have any best practice / advice to work with google sheets / excel, especially considering TESTS?
