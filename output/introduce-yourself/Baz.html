Hi :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>I'm <a href="https://bazlightyear.info">Baz</a>. In general I work on new communications networks that use powerful cryptography to reduce our dependency on platforms and deliver an internet as magical as it was meant to be. I've really loved exploring local first software, p2p systems, blockchain, ZK proofs, oblivious compute - and see those tools as our best hope for liberating the web. Would love to jam with anyone that has a strong opinion about that, for or against. I grew up, live and work in London, studied philosophy at uni; spent lots of time on cross-platform identity tools :heart:
