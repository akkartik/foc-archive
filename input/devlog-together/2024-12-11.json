He created a compiler for it in about 8 hours by getting Claude 3.5 Sonnet to write code that maps Voltair to legal Go code (approx. 2000 LOC). Voltair programs now build and run, while the Go compiler does the heavy lifting of doing the actual compilation work. As I understand it, Phillips started out by getting Claude to write OhmJS code to do the mapping.",
