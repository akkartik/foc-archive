&gt; It might seem that the “escape” would be to create some tool (or language, etc.) to improve software/programming, and then remake the tool using the tool itself. However, this standard definition of “bootstrapping” does nothing to break free from the limited context of the tool.<br/>Right. The power of bootstrapping is the tight feedback cycle and.. intimacy. The cost is not getting to learn from real world priorities and constraints, losing sight of a user who is not you.<br/>If you’re trying to change the nature of programming, if you want it to be more democratic, accessible, and cheap, who are your users? Are they still programming professionals? How general purpose can your tool really be? And how can you build it in a way that’s tight with (learns from, is accountable to) the target users?<br/>These aren’t the 1980's. You can’t create the ability to put numbers in boxes and have the whole world sing your praises because the alternative is paper. The environment now is far more complex. The real benefits of what we (each) want to build will come only with time and investment by a user community.
