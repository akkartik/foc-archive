I decided to make a pass at actually putting technical information on the <a href="http://calculang.dev">calculang.dev</a> frontpage.<br/>My primary audience for <a href="http://calculang.dev">calculang.dev</a> is developers - due to the wide scope, I think this is important (and Steve Balmer, right?).<br/>Other projects based on/around calculang will have a wider audience.<br/><br/>It's the first time I surface some information: about introspection output to help to make tools that interact with models, about a comparison to spreadsheets, a rough note about my visualization APIs. I'll expand on all these things in longer-form separately and add illustrations for some concepts (especially "flexibility"), but for now, I think it's important I have some things down that I can iterate on, and happy to hear any immediate feedback, especially about what lands especially poorly or doesn't fit! (since this is a community of developers, your feedback would be awesome for me to get to work)<br/><br/>I intend to push the Examples to a Gallery or Playground page instead, with just a more subtle carousal or such surfaced early in the main page
