I have been a bit quiet the last month and thought I'd do a quick update.  Typically in January I let myself go off on a tangent or two, and that leads to new discoveries and an opportunity for my brain to rest a bit from the bigger picture.  So in Jan, I contributed some code to Sonic Pi.  It's an opportunity to help a great OS project and contribute some of what I've learned.  Also, selfishly it is a way for me to learn more about a live coding tool and its inner workings (new learnings: OSC is cool as a communcation mechanism, inter process communication isn't as hard as I thought, and vcpkg continues to be a life saver).<br/>My focus was to separate the communication with the Ruby server from the GUI, which is frankly, in need of clean up.  As part of that I added a CI step which built the app and played a chord using Github actions on all 3 platforms, and did a quick demo of combining Sonic Pi and GPU shaders - this functions as an API test and demo; it is not intended to replace the existing UI.<br/>In February<br/>I'm working on a more private project in my spare time.  Some time in March/April when I'm let back into the open again (!) I will get back to my music project, which may well take a turn towards more of a graph-based editor - since I did some research into that over Christmas; getting to the point where I have a flexible UI for displaying nodes, and the ability to drag them around on screen.<br/><a href="https://youtu.be/cl1ABJLMvRc">https://youtu.be/cl1ABJLMvRc</a>
