The use of a feminist lens is one way (of many) to identify these power dynamics. Another issue is about gender diversity in the field, and how evidently easy it is to produce a list of important work done by men, and how much harder it is to produce such a list done by women. There is a subtle element of identifying the cultural dynamics and predilections that appear in work done by men vs women, and while I believe that's a real and important factor, nobody is saying that we need to let this be the framework for making future decisions. It's just input we can use to help understand what's going on.\n\nIf this doesn't make sense, that's okay. We can, perhaps, help explain the thinking, and that might help it make sense.\n\nBut I will strongly caution everyone that this is a _highly_ sensitive subject. I'm going to moderate this discussion. For instance: I do not want to see ideas being dismissed because they're not understood.",

The use of a feminist lens is one way (of many) to identify these power dynamics. Another issue is about gender diversity in the field, and how evidently easy it is to produce a list of important work done by men, and how much harder it is to produce such a list done by women. There is a subtle element of identifying the cultural dynamics and predilections that appear in work done by men vs women, and while I believe that's a real and important factor, nobody is saying that we need to let this be the framework for making future decisions. It's just input we can use to help understand what's going on.\n\nIf this doesn't make sense, that's okay. We can, perhaps, help explain the thinking, and that might help it make sense.\n\nBut I will strongly caution everyone that this is a "
