Is coding/programming/computering/beepbooping/funking of corn a hobby or a job to you? Or both? It's both for me and I'm increasingly having the two diverge. "Work" coding and "home" coding feel like two entirely different worlds.

This one time I went to a tech meetup but it turned out to be a recruiting event in disguise - but I had the "fun" coding hat on and discovered that not that many people wearing "work" hats are interested in PowerBooks and coding Cocoa apps for Mac OS X Tiger.

Hobby developer here. Coding is like gardening to me. You can do it on a commercial farm, scale and optimize it. But you can also have a garden next to your house, a place where it's just nice to be in and which occasionally gives you some value back. There are people who maintain their gardens their whole life for almost no benefit. From a commercial perspective it's madness.
