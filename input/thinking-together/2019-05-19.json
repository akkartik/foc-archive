Subsequently a lot of the focus is on better databases, better UIs, better compiler toolchains, or more generally better “abstractions”, whatever that means. However I haven’t seen a strong presence in this community from e.g. hardware, cloud computing and data processing, data science, hard sciences (bio, physics, chem, …), supercomputing, simulation, security and privacy, blockchain\/crypto, machine learning and AI, robotics, and so on.\n\nI partly mention those apps because in academia (at least Stanford), those are the problem spaces that academics are placing their bets on as the future of ~coding~ computer science. Of course, there’s a completely separate question of how much of the future is engineering vs. research, how much academia values engineering, etc. but I at least wanted to raise the initial question.",

Subsequently a lot of the focus is on better databases, better UIs, better compiler toolchains, or more generally better “abstractions”, whatever that means. However I haven’t seen a strong presence in this community from e.g. hardware, cloud computing and data processing, data science, hard sciences (bio, physics, chem, …), supercomputing, simulation, security and privacy, blockchain\/crypto, machine learning and AI, robotics, and so on.\n\nI partly mention those apps because in academia (at least Stanford), those are the problem spaces that academics are placing their bets on as the future of "

I spend all my time thinking about messaging and communication between systems, and “decomposition” feels like a luxury. I don’t know if that’s a general change in programming, or just the nature of my work or professional stage… but it feels like a real change to me.\n\nThat is, I spend a lot of time thinking about these things:\n1. What are the entities in my system? These could be as simple as objects, but might be remote services, or different processes, browser tabs, etc.\n2. Who knows what?\n3. Who needs to keep track of what?\n4. From any given context, how do I get access to the other entities?\n5. How do I communicate with them? The push\/pull of functions or RPC? Pub\/sub? Some wonky event system?\n6. Where does a particular change originate, and which entities are simply reactive?\n\nThis all is where a lot of modern language development leaves me cold.
