It’s been amazing to see how powerful chat-based interfaces, heralded by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, can be. It’s inspired some to postulate that text is the universal interface, and for others to say that the humble text box is going to be the most important interface component there is.\nThis enthusiasm, understandable though it may be, risks creating the perception that any and all user interfaces can be more or less replaced with a chatbot or text-box based interface.",

I think there’s value for a novice, or even expert to be able to use a chat interface to define the rough requirements and then the output of that conversation would be a starter or template file that could then be opened in the software and further edited \/ tweaked. I think you touched on some a key point: complex software is complex because it solves complex problems. Chat interfaces are not best suited to do the complex stuff, but they can help us do the simple stuff, that previously may have been difficult due to complicated UI.",

I think there’s value for a novice, or even expert to be able to use a chat interface to define the rough requirements and then the output of that conversation would be a starter or template file that could then be opened in the software and further edited \/ tweaked. I think you touched on some a key point: complex software is complex because it solves complex problems. Chat interfaces are not best suited to do the complex stuff, but they can help us do the simple stuff, that previously may have been difficult due to complicated UI."
