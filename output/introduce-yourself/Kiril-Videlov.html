Hey folks! Just found this community from a post on a Discord about low profile keyboard. My name is Kiril and I live in Stockholm, Sweden. I like developer tools, build systems, programming languages and combinatorics / optimisation. I have worked / toyed with Go, Rust, Clojure, Bazel build, making custom keyboards.<br/><br/>Not too long ago I worked at a company called Tink, focused on developer tools - making build times faster (cache-able, remote etc) locally and in CI. In general, making creating a tighter feedback loop for developers.<br/><br/>This year I co-founded a company with the goal of making the developer life better. It is somewhat unpopular to question Git but we wanted to explore and experiment with development workflows that are not constrained by it. You can check out  and try what we have so far here <a href="https://getsturdy.com/">https://getsturdy.com/</a>
