In as much as boxes and nodes systems reflect the complexity of what you're doing, perhaps a lack of scalability goes to show that the complexity is visible whereas we're better at hiding it in a textural environment!

My dogma is howling, telling me I should :thumbsup: this to heaven. But I don't quite agree.<br/><br/>I think typical <em>nodes-and-noodles</em> languages are too complex because they aren't actually "visual" — they're just sprawled-out text languages with the demand that you bounce back and forth between keyboard and mouse. Most of this complexity is incidental, just of a different kind than text languages that don't (eg) make control flow so explicit.<br/><br/>A true VPL would let you both name and draw nodes, and animate them to reflect state. Then you can build yourself (or use built-in) nice visual abstractions for state machines, remote procedures, query and pattern matching, testing, etc.<br/><br/>Yep, that's complex and would take new kinds of skill and effort. But you spend those efforts on things that improve comprehension dramatically.<br/><br/>I'm advocating for a Lisp of visual languages, in a sense.

I don't quite agree either — though I wouldn't have written it if there weren't something to the sentiment.  For full disclosure, I like NnN (nodes-and-noodles) languages at their best: when the nodes embed control widgets, when edges are dynamically inspectable, when zoom is semantic, when layout is easy, when the interface has nice typed/structured editing.  Text has a compactness advantage, is more string search friendly, and in a way doesn't promise as much.  Few are surprised if they can write anything sensible in a hello.some-new-language file without having read a tutorial if not a book whereas NnN give more the appearance of immediate access to beginners.

&gt; zoom is semantic<br/><br/>Can you elaborate on that point?
