We all have good ideas, and many of them converge or seem <b>cough</b> synergistic. The problem for us is predominantly in figuring out  the right environment and strategy for letting them grow. Politics, positioning, and aesthetics matter. Attitude mattersâ€”especially humility and patience, without losing the ambition to chase the big ideas. Money matters: who you take it from and when. Resourcing matters: skills in design, CS, user research, marketing, business, etc; and creating an intellectual environment with the right size and balance to learn deeply what most needs learning.
