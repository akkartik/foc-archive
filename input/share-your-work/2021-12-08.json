This extends Observable's reactive notebooks to the backend. Its unique features are instant deploys, and it can redirect traffic to your browser, so you can do devtool or console.log debugging against production traffic. It's a unique way of sharing code across frontend and backend.\n\nMy aim is to create a serverless environment that is a pleasure to use as a developer. I am really desperate for feedback, so if you give it a go let know the positives and negatives.",
