I agree with your criticism of Haskell-like languages. To express iteration, while loops together with mutable local variables are much easier to understand than tail recursion, or programming with combinators. I picked up the former ideas pretty quickly when I was young, but it took me several more years to understand recursion.<br/><br/>My language, Curv, is designed to be simple and easy to use. There is no shared mutable state, because that makes programs harder to understand. But there are mutable local variables, there are assignment statements (conditional and unconditional), and there is a <tt>while</tt> loop, because that's often the easiest way to implement iteration.<br/><br/>I'm using Curv as a counterexample to your claim that FP is unnatural, and requires very strong mathematical ability. I think that applies to Haskell, which was designed by and for mathematicians. But it doesn't apply to the entire class of languages that lack shared mutable state.
