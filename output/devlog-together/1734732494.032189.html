There were some tricky problems to solve to get to this. Still glitching and a WIP, but finally piece number 3 is beginning to come together, a userspace notebook renderer inside a notebook, that works with the existing observable notebook cells, but whose layout state can be drastically different, and yet still persisted via single file export. All the pieces are reactively editable insider the notebook. The notebook state <em>is</em> the editor. There is no distinction between the development UI and the executing program, and its a single 1.2MB HTML file that works offline.
