For communicating ideas between human beings, just like written language. In the early days of programming, before the first compiler, we wrote programs in high level languages for the purpose of communicating algorithms between programmers, and mathematical notation was invented centuries before that. The lambda calculus is now considered an early programming language, but it was invented in the 1930's as a notation for describing recursive functions, and it clearly wasn't a \"tool\" then."
