ChatGPT <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">https://chat.openai.com/chat</a> appears to be open general use.  In this thread <a href="https://twitter.com/tylerangert/status/1598389755997290507">https://twitter.com/tylerangert/status/1598389755997290507</a> someone gets ChatGPT to "redesign git step by step."  I thought it would be fun to ask about how Procs in Ruby work.  I'll say more as a comment.  tl;dr ChatGPT gets them confused with blocks, which any person might do who has read about Ruby but hasn't programmed in it.

In my ChatGPT conversation, I it to make a list of ways to invoke Procs in Ruby.  One item on the list was <tt>yield(10, &amp;my_proc)</tt>, which really doesn't work at all.  So I said, "&amp;my_proc allows you to pass my_proc as the block to a method, but yield(10, &amp;my_proc) won't usually call my_proc.  Can you define a method called silly_yield so that silly_yield(10, &amp;my_proc) does do what think yield is doing?‚Äù  Here's the reply.

Though the list didn't include all the other ways you can invoke a Proc, it did think of one that didn't immediately come to mind, <tt>my_proc === 10</tt>.  I asked vaguely why <tt>===</tt> is defined on Proc, how would you use it?  And eventually wrapped up with an example before, it seems, ChatGPT decided I had used too much of its CPU.

My next message would have been, "That's a nice example.  Did you know you can write <tt>proc(&amp;:odd?)</tt> instead?  Let's see the example using that shorter syntax instead."
