I'll see myself out of this conversation, i need to time to work around the topic on my own. I hope to learn some category theory then dabble in a language that employee s it. My frustration comes from  lacking a deeper understand of how it might help and a sense that only having that deeper understanding would make the tool useful. I'm not going to get that tackling the question head on.
