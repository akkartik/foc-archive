Both Apple and Microsoft, given their R&amp;D budgets seem paralyzed in terms of making new products. It's been many years since they added something new, even by acquisition. I think there is a certain size above which companies become like dinosaurs, where the signals take too long to travel inside the organization, and there are too many layers.  I think the only idea worth much from Microsoft Research in the last 10 years was the Hololens, which i think has great future potential.  But in terms of R&amp;D divided by money spent, a pretty bad equation at both companies. With Jobs gone, Apple has perfected their production and refinement of existing products, but they couldn't even get a two device charging pad out the door recently.",

Both Apple and Microsoft, given their R&D budgets seem paralyzed in terms of making new products. It's been many years since they added something new, even by acquisition. I think there is a certain size above which companies become like dinosaurs, where the signals take too long to travel inside the organization, and there are too many layers.  I think the only idea worth much from Microsoft Research in the last 10 years was the Hololens, which i think has great future potential.  But in terms of R&D divided by money spent, a pretty bad equation at both companies. With Jobs gone, Apple has perfected their production and refinement of existing products, but they couldn't even get a two device charging pad out the door recently."
