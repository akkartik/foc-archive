The kinds of transformation in programming I'm keen on go in hand-in-hand with fundamental insights into logic, ontology, and communication (as the medium of community).\n• Cooperativism, the social and solidarity economy, and (left) utopian political prefiguration more generally\nThat said, my activities are often not much beyond dabbling in this or that.\nOutside of work, most of my programming is the OCaml ecosystem.\n\nHappy to be here and I look forward to learning from the conversations.",
