G'day folks,<br/><br/>Have had a long term fascination with alternative operating systems and visual programming systems over the years - was delighted to discover the Future of Coding community.<br/><br/>Currently gearing up to build my own visual programming system on iOS, seeking advice from anyone who I can talk to about building non-strict/lazily evaluated languages.<br/><br/>Am on the road in Vietnam at the moment, would be overjoyed to meet any other FoCers who might be based in SEA.
