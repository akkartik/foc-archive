The challenge lies in preventing hallucinations and incorrect extrapolations from the outline. Early experimental results have been promising prompting me to create a dedicated workflow tool. This tool enables me to swiftly input point-form outlines, using the user-friendly Kinopio platform for brainstorming. I then paste the outline to ChatGPT, transforming it into coherent and readable prose. Join me in revolutionizing idea development and content creation with this innovative solution!
