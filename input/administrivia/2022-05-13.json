I'm skeptical that there can ever be a singular framing for the general public; that's the kind of thing we might discuss here, in a group for people creating the things we might then try to convince the public is useful...\n\nThe main problem I see is that we don't agree on our goals except in the very broadest terms of making programming better, somehow. Any name more specific than that is going to fit awkwardly at best.\n\nBTW, here's another vote against incorporating people's names. Having heroes is almost always a mistake, let's not institutionalize them in a spot that's hard to change. Rather keep the same name.",

I'm skeptical that there can ever be a singular framing for the general public; that's the kind of thing we might discuss here, in a group for people creating the things we might then try to convince the public is useful...\n\nThe main problem I see is that we don't agree on our goals except in the very broadest terms of making programming better, somehow. Any name more specific than that is going to fit awkwardly at best.\n\nBTW, here's another vote against incorporating people's names. Having heroes is almost always a mistake, let's not institutionalize them in a spot that's hard to change. Rather keep the same name."
