> Hi, I'm Raghav Agrawal from Mumbai, India. I work in the diamond trading industry (part of a small family business specializing in loose diamond exports) but I've immersed myself in self-education curating research for design theory, philosophy of technology, media studies, educational theories, philosophy of science, and cognitive science for quite a while. All this culminated into a project idea : A small catalogue of novel edtech interface patterns that introduce a new way of online learning, teaching. I have recently enrolled in an offline UX bootcamp to materialize some of the ideas and was introduced to this group by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Pranav Pramod</span>. <br/>> <br/>> My interest in the tool for thought space is to figure out if we can conceive of entirely new pedagogies via material properties unique to the computing medium instead of replicating linear ways of teaching online like the way LMSes operate, in short interested in novel edtech interfaces
