Hey hey! I'm Roma. I am based around Paris, France. I love CSS, and everything I do is related to it in one way or another.<br/>		  <br/>I work as a frontend engineer, working on design systems as my main job, and spending my spare time experimenting with CSS and trying to push the boundaries of what is possible with it. And then publishing long and nerdy articles on my personal site with the results. I'm also a CSSWG member. You are welcome to ask me any questions about CSS (on any level — it is important to understand what people struggle with for “simple” stuff as well).<br/>		  <br/>I don't remember how exactly I stumbled upon the Future of Coding podcast: likely, from Mastodon, or from me searching for people talking about some of the Bret Victor's ideas. In many ways, I feel a bit out of my depth (being mostly a self-taught engineer), but I constantly try to get inspiration from very different areas.<br/><br/>In the new year, I am planning to work a bit more on one of my slowly ongoing pet projects (for live CSS explorations and permutations), and might share some progress here if I'll manage to fight my anxiety :slightly_smiling_face:
