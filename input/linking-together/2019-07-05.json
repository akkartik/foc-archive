On Alexander's death, his empire did not crumble to dust, but fragmented into some of the major subsystems that had composed it. If one would be Alexander, one should be born into a world where large stable political systems already exist. Where this condition was not fulfilled, as on the Scythian and Indian frontiers, Alexander found empire building a slippery business. So too, T. E. Lawrence's organizing of the Arabian revolt against the Turks was limited by the character of his largest stable building blocks, the separate, suspicious desert tribes..\n\nI'm not an expert on any of this, but it's just delightful to see a reference to history in a technical paper.",

On Alexander's death, his empire did not crumble to dust, but fragmented into some of the major subsystems that had composed it. If one would be Alexander, one should be born into a world where large stable political systems already exist. Where this condition was not fulfilled, as on the Scythian and Indian frontiers, Alexander found empire building a slippery business. So too, T. E. Lawrence's organizing of the Arabian revolt against the Turks was limited by the character of his largest stable building blocks, the separate, suspicious desert tribes.."
