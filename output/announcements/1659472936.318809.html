Introducing #devlog-together.<br/><br/>Are you working on things but don’t have something ready to share on #share-your-work or #two-minute-week? This new channel is the perfect place to share and get some feedback on your work.<br/><br/>Some guidelines:<br/><br/>Try to make your content relevant to FOC. Does your project have to be the most futuristic amazing project ever? No. But it should somehow aspire or be moving towards future of coding topics. Try and make sure the community sees how it fits in.<br/><br/>Keep top level posts to tweetish length and only post top level once per day.<br/><br/>I’ve always wanted a place where I can share my on-going projects with others. But I’ve also really wanted to see what others are working about and thinking about. This will hopefully be a great place to do that. Looking forward to seeing what you all have going.

I greatly appreciate how much time and care is spent on understanding the different modes of chat in this community, and creating subsections to make space for them. Looking forward to sharing my amateurish work! :grin:
