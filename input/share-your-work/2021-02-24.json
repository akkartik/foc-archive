I think altering sizes as in your demo is a compelling concept for more efficient code comprehension. <@UHWC9PXBL> is correct that there is some overlap in my Tiled Text project, though I was trying to solve a different problem (efficiently navigating\/manipulating structured text with low-precision\/low unique-symbol-count input devices). The way my system was structured would make it easy to render text at varying sizes as a function of tree depth—but it leaves a number of questions open-ended about practically editing programs, and the code is a nightmare jumble of 10 year old java. Looking forward to seeing more of your videos!",
