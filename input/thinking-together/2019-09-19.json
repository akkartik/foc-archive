We have been working with ideas represented on paper (a non-interactive medium with writings and drawings), on computer screens (similar but interactive, with keyboard and mouse). Can we represent and work with ideas in an interactive physical space? Of course some ideas are already rendered as physical objects (e.g. a scaled down model car) that represent physical objects. But can we represent other non physical ideas in such a medium? Can we get a better understanding of them, or a different way to share and think about them? What are these representations even like - what does 'physical UI' of an idea look like? That's my take on the whole thing anyway, and I don't think they've gotten very far, but they're also very early in this.",

We have been working with ideas represented on paper (a non-interactive medium with writings and drawings), on computer screens (similar but interactive, with keyboard and mouse). Can we represent and work with ideas in an interactive physical space? Of course some ideas are already rendered as physical objects (e.g. a scaled down model car) that represent physical objects. But can we represent other non physical ideas in such a medium? Can we get a better understanding of them, or a different way to share and think about them? What are these representations even like - what does 'physical UI' of an idea look like? That's my take on the whole thing anyway, and I don't think they've gotten very far, but they're also very early in this."
