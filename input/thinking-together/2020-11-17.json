I consider it _more_ expressive because it creates a new structure for loops that allows us to reason about updates separately from the body. Lisp macros are powerful because they allow my program to get progressively more expressive. Isn't this the normal meaning of the term? A more expressive language helps you express intent more tersely.\n\nThe paper is cool. But they need to get off my lawn and find a new term for themselves.
