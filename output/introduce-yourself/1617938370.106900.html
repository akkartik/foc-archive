Hello! I'm Braden. Trained as a biomedical engineer and spent my career developing medical devices. I'm currently an innovation fellow at the Medical Device Center at the University of Minnesota. It's a year-long leadership program to find an unmet medical problem and come up with a new device to address it. I'm was referred to the FoC slack from the Julia Discourse forum.<br/><br/>My main interest is accelerating the rate at which we (everyone) develop products. The frustrating reality for many product designers is solving a problem that has been solved before ... but the solution is inaccessible (paywalls, trade secrets, lost, forgotten, poorly documented). Some people shrug and say "that's just the way it works." I see this as an avoidable waste of the time and energy of <b>many</b> engineers, scientists, and designers. I think programming is a key element to addressing this problem.<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Molham Aref</span>, I enjoyed your talk at JuliaCon 2020. I met a few people from relationalAI for beers ages ago, and it seems like you've curated an incredibly talented team.

hi <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Braden Eliason</span>, nice to connect here and thanks for your kind words about the team.  We have Nathan, Sacha, and Huda on our team from the Julia community.  A few others are in the process of joining as well.  I hope our paths cross again soon.

Likewise. I hope we stay connected.<br/><br/>I met Jordan, a Program Manager, and a few other people whose names I forgotten from rAI at a Julia meetup event.
