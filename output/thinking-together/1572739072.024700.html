The software that is released seems fast enough, but what about the programs that never get written? Some behavior is very easy to model precisely using maths but trying to implement the modeling language bogs you down in low-level details. It would be nice to be able to experiment with reasonable performance on a supercomputer without having to worry so much about making programs usable on a regular computer.<br/>One example of this is FRP which took a while to run well for a limited set of programs. However, the model is way more expressive than what gets implemented.
