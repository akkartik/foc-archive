Hi all. I'm interested in safer, easier to use programming languages. I suppose like many here, I was fascinated by Bret Victor's famous presentation, and I've been following another series of interesting attempts at <a href="https://alarmingdevelopment.org/">https://alarmingdevelopment.org/</a>. Discovered the podcast recently, and hope to find more thought provoking resources here. (I don't think I'm going to attempt to build something myself anytime soon, but one never knows.)
