From my studies, I came to realize that the reading time is spent in two parts: (1) find the code that is worth being read, (2) read that code. The first one, which occupies most of the energy, is not a reading problem. It's a search problem, and we should spend the energy in fundamental different ways."

When I paint a painting, I'm not going to get feedback from my audience (or any buyers) until after the painting is done. Some painters might benefit from getting that feedback throughout the creative process. Most (myself included) would surely find it stifling.\n\nPoint: It is at least _conceivable_ that there are benefits to the _lack_ of immediate feedback when programming. It'd be interesting to try to spitball what those benefits might be. It requires a broader sense of \"feedback\" than just \"does it compile and what does it do when run?\", which is of course a broader sense than the one <@U8A5MS6R1> intended, but worth considering because we're all here exploring that broader space.",
