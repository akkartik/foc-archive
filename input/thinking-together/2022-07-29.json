        "text": "<@UCGAK10LS> interesting stuff! You raise a couple of important points:\n• A conception of objects as defined by relations, which as you point out can persist beyond the existence of the original object. This also points to the ontological status of digital objects, and wether an object can be ontologically independent (imho they probably can't be). It also raises the question of the kinds of relations relevant to objects, e.g. do objects have a meronomy (part-whole relation) where their attributes or properties are contained “within” the object. In my view, this question doesn't have a single answer and it comes down to context\/perspective. A property may be “part of” an object from one view, and an external relation from another view.\n• The question of _identity_! This is actually what prompted me to write the paper, as I think this is a much harder question, and one that I think naturally follows from a conception of ‘digital object’. Identity is essentially the question of “sameness” over time\/place\/context\/etc. In your OOP language example, I think it’s not exactly the location in memory that gives an object its identity, but is instead the interaction between the addressing system (often a location in memory) and the mutability system (which is conceptually related to identity). This is only true at the language level though, and doesn't entirely track to broader systems.\nIn the paper I introduce and build on two related notions: “Objects as addressability” and “Identity as governance” which roughly correspond to the points you made (though I take a systems-theoretic view, not a language one). I think its only when viewing these together that we get a more complete picture. I think the mutability-as-default of our systems may have contributed to the conflation between these two notions. I’m also aware that “addresssability” and “governance” are undefined here, but I’ll leave that for the future for now.",

This also points to the ontological status of digital objects, and wether an object can be ontologically independent (imho they probably can't be). It also raises the question of the kinds of relations relevant to objects, e.g. do objects have a meronomy (part-whole relation) where their attributes or properties are contained “within” the object. In my view, this question doesn't have a single answer and it comes down to context\/perspective. A property may be “part of” an object from one view, and an external relation from another view."

This is actually what prompted me to write the paper, as I think this is a much harder question, and one that I think naturally follows from a conception of ‘digital object’. Identity is essentially the question of “sameness” over time\/place\/context\/etc. In your OOP language example, I think it’s not exactly the location in memory that gives an object its identity, but is instead the interaction between the addressing system (often a location in memory) and the mutability system (which is conceptually related to identity). This is only true at the language level though, and doesn't entirely track to broader systems."

I think its only when viewing these together that we get a more complete picture. I think the mutability-as-default of our systems may have contributed to the conflation between these two notions. I’m also aware that “addresssability” and “governance” are undefined here, but I’ll leave that for the future for now."
