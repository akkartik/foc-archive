It seems like people have constructed some strawmen to attack in response to my post about John Backus. Nobody was suggesting that we should all be using Haskell. The point was to spur thought about our bias towards thinking about programming, particularly in terms of what our forebears and peers have told us is the "standard" or "efficient" or "practical" or even the "only" way of doing things (and whether this bias is something worth escaping). Ironically, this has conjured up discussion about the popular (and false) imperative/FP dichotomy, and the strengths and weaknesses of the two regimes, which is exactly the kind of <em>mindset-of-our-forebears</em> problem that the discussion was supposed to be <em>about</em>.
