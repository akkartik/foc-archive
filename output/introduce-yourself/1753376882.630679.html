Hello World! I'm <a href="https://arcades.agency/portfolio.html">Arcade Wise</a>, 18 and from... I guess the southeastern United States? I've lived all over and college is in Iowa.<br/>Given the mention of college I bet you can figure out that I'm a student, studying Computer Science and German.<br/>I haven't had enough time recently to do much coding, but I think y'all might like my project "<a href="https://arcades.agency/icbinf.html">I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT FORTH</a>," a little project to write HTML widgets in a forth-like language.<br/><br/>I've been mainly involved with the folk.computer people, I really think projected AR is a really interesting thing that not enough people have access to. I'm also tangential to the <a href="https://computingwithinlimits.org/2025/">LIMITS</a> (Computing Within Limits) conference, and the larger degrowth-club of Rome movement as a whole.<br/><br/>As for how I got into the FoC community, I was introduced to Ivan and Co. by Lu, whose videos I had watched for a while and met at Strange Loop (RIP).
