I sent the bulk of my feedback via email, but here’s some bits that might be profitable for public discussion.<br/>---<br/>You might be interested in Tessa Lau’s “Why Programming by Demonstration Systems Fail: Lessons Learned from Usable AI” (AAAI 2009 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1609/aimag.v30i4.2262">https://doi.org/10.1609/aimag.v30i4.2262</a>), which covers some of what you are saying. She cites five design guidelines from her experience:<br/><br/>1. “Detect failure and fail gracefully”<br/>2. “Make it easy to correct the system”<br/>3. “Encourage trust by presenting a model the users can understand”<br/>4. “Enable partial automation”<br/>5. “Consider the bottom-line value of automation”<br/>---<br/>&gt; Input/output pairs are a poor model for program specifications in most cases<br/><br/>It is true that under the text-based conception of programming by example (PBE), it is hard to build lots of I/O examples. But I think it’s too early to say PBE is broken: instead, the open question is when does it work, and with what tools? We don’t know to what degree better tools can help support example creation. For example, when you have a large data structure, you can often specify a desired operation with only a <b>single</b> example. Making that example in text could be laborious, but why do you need to do it in text without help? Several of the transformations in Sketch-n-Sketch can be thought of as single-example PBE synthesis, but it is usable because the tool helps you build the example.<br/>---<br/>Some synthesis works that the FoC readership might enjoy glancing at:<br/><br/>For various ways to interact with programming by example, there’s Mayer et al. “User Interaction Models for Disambiguation in Programming by Example” (UIST 2015 <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rishabh/papers/uist15-flashprog.pdf">https://people.csail.mit.edu/rishabh/papers/uist15-flashprog.pdf</a>)<br/><br/>Android studio offers automatic translation of nested loops to functional code: <a href="https://twitter.com/akosma/status/937279410297851904">https://twitter.com/akosma/status/937279410297851904</a><br/><br/>For API discovery from natural language, the first work I think of is “Synthesizing Java expressions from free-form queries” Gvero and Kuncak, OOPSLA 2015 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2814270.2814295">https://doi.org/10.1145/2814270.2814295</a>.<br/><br/>And for repurposing code from Stack Overflow, there’s “Program Splicing” Lu et al. ICSE 2018 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3180155.3180190">https://doi.org/10.1145/3180155.3180190</a>.

don’t have much critical feedback here - just chiming in to say I really liked this paper. as a casual observer of programming-by-example and program synthesis stuff, I found it super readable and am excited about the vision. especially like the phrase “the programmer must be updated along with the program” as a concise summary of something we tend to overlook if we don’t take an explicitly human-centric approach, and the consideration of how this might impact teams rather than solo programmers alone

Big shout-out again to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Brian Hempel</span> for extensive constructive comments. I’ll post a revised version here soon. Thanks for the kinds words Max and Steve :slightly_smiling_face:

Also this 2017 arXiv-only paper from MSR: “SMARTPASTE: Learning to Adapt Source Code” Allamanis and Brockschmidt <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07867.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07867.pdf</a><br/>&gt; Deep Neural Networks have been shown to succeed at a range of natural language tasks such as machine translation and text summarization. While tasks on source code (ie, formal languages) have been considered recently, most work in this area does not attempt to capitalize on the unique opportunities offered by its known syntax and structure. In this work, we introduce SmartPaste, a first task that requires to use such information. The task is a variant of the program repair problem that requires to adapt a given (pasted) snippet of code to surrounding, existing source code. As first solutions, we design a set of deep neural models that learn to represent the context of each variable location and variable usage in a data flow-sensitive way. Our evaluation suggests that our models can learn to solve the SmartPaste task in many cases, achieving 58.6% accuracy, while learning meaningful representation of variable usages.
