For lambdas and shaders, where it's executed \"at a later time\" and similar to condition, we also have match (switch statement) and inspect, where only one subnet of a list of subnets is executed. The idea came naturally from regular programming languages, where you also have scopes.\n\nUsually a ui can have a selection but still has also a single focus (where the keyboards at). I forgot to mention, that if you drag the probe window, it will stick to the node until you close it. Not sure if that's final yet, as sometimes you drag the window to get it out of the way.\n\nMostly noise and space. I want to keep the graph really tight.
